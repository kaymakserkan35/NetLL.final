1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,230
i dragged you out of hell.
i can throw you back in.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,960
you should show me
some respect.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,430
in the coming months,you will
have more decisions to make.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,030
sam:
dean,what was it like?

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,900
what,hell?

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,300
i don't know.
i-i must have blacked it out.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,200
i don't remember
a damn thing.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,160
this is uriel,
a specialist.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,030
specializing in what?

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,230
both of you,you need to leave
this town immediately.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,760
why?

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,530
because we're about
to destroy it.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,800
the only reason you're still
alive,sam winchester,

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,400
is because
you've been useful.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,200
the moment that ceases
to be true,

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,300
then i will
turn you to dust.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,760
ask dean what he remembers
from hell.

18
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,830
hello?

19
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,200
is anybody there?

20
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,830
um,hello?

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,500
it just doesn't make
any sense,dean.

22
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,730
i mean,
why would uriel tell me

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
you remembered hell
if you didn't?

24
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,400
maybe because he's a
prick -- might have
something to do with it.

25
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,800
maybe,but he's
still an angel.

26
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,800
yeah,an angel who was ready
to level an entire town.

27
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,460
look,i don't know what --
man: radical.

28
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,060
what else can i get
you guys?

29
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,030
uh,i think we're good.
yeah?

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
you want to try a couple
of fryer bombs

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,400
or a chipotle
chili changa?

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,800
no,no,
we're still good.

33
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,030
okay,awesome.

34
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,860
sam,honestly,

35
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,230
i have no idea why uriel
told you what he did,okay?

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,960
right.

37
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,300
what?
okay.

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,030
fine. then look me
in the eye

39
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,730
and tell me
you don't remember a thing

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,360
from your time
down under.

41
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,930
i don't remember a thing
from my time down under.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
i don't remember,sam!

43
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,360
look,dean,
i just want to help.

44
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,660
<i>you know everything i do. okay?
that's all there is.</i>

45
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,500
outstanding.
dessert time?

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,730
huh? am i right?

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,860
dude.
listen,bros.

48
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,300
<i>you have got to try
our ice cream extreme.</i>

49
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,530
it's extreme.

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,800
uh,no extremities,
please.

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,800
just the --
check?

52
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,630
all right,awesome.
thanks.

53
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,200
all right,
so,where do we go from here?

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,000
i'm not sure.

55
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,330
uh,looks like
it's been pretty quiet lately.

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,960
no signs of demon activity,
no omens or portents i can see.

57
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,530
that's good news
for once.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,160
yeah,just
the typical smattering

59
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,860
of crank ufo sightings

60
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,630
and one possible
vengeful spirit.

61
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,530
here,check this out.
uh...

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,060
up in concrete,
washington,

63
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,500
eyewitness reports
of a ghost

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,760
that's been haunting the showers
of a women's health facility.

65
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,060
the victim claims
that the ghost

66
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,930
threw her down
a flight of stairs.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,230
<i>i can see
you're very interested.</i>

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,630
women,showers.

69
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,130
we got to save
these people.

70
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,600
i'm not surprised
the spirit world

71
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,000
chose to make contact
with me.

72
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,200
i'm something of a...

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,160
natural sensitive.

74
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,800
i can sense that about you,
candace,that whole...

75
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,130
sensitive thing.

76
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,400
so,what did you say
you're calling your book?

77
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,630
oh,well,um...

78
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,630
well,the working
title is...

79
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,060
"supernatural."

80
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,930
yeah,i've been crossing
the country,

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,430
gathering stories
like yours.

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,400
but,anyways,you were telling
me about your encounter.

83
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,760
yes. well [sighs]

84
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,600
once i saw the apparition,

85
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,030
that's when i started
to run.

86
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,830
and you said
the ghost chased you?

87
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,600
not just that.
it knew my name.

88
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,130
it kept yelling,

89
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,730
"mrs. armstrong!
mrs. armstrong!"

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,230
and that's when i hit
the stairs and fell.

91
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,200
you fell?
the ghost didn't push you.

92
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,500
oh,i don't --
i don't know.

93
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,930
<i>i mean,i think it did.</i>

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,430
maybe.

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,000
did you feel like it meant
to hurt you,

96
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,200
like it was violent,or...

97
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,160
<i>it was a ghost.
i'm lucky to be alive.</i>

98
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,260
anyway,i was at the bottom
of the stairs,

99
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,530
and that's when
it got weird.

100
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,460
[ chuckles ]
it helped me up.

101
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,530
say again?

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,060
yeah.
it helped me up.

103
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,060
and it kept saying
over and over,

104
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,330
"please,
don't tell my mom."

105
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,930
yeah,that's weird.

106
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,660
well,you pick up
anything?

107
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,600
no emf in the shower
or anywhere else.

108
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,900
this house is clean.

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,330
yeah.
i'm not surprised.

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,100
i kind of got the feeling
back there

111
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,660
<i>that crazy pushed mrs. armstrong
down the stairs.</i>

112
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,400
i got to tell you,
i'm pretty disappointed.

113
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
[ exhales sharply ]
you wanted to save naked women.

114
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,060
damn right i wanted to save
some naked women.

115
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,530
[ chuckles lightly ]

116
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
come on,guys,get him!

117
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,200
boy: i got him!
i got him!

118
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,730
run,forrest,run!

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,060
sorry,dean,but i
don't think anything's
going on around here.

120
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,060
gus: how the hell was i supposed
to get a look at it?

121
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,060
it grabbed me from behind
and threw me into a tree!

122
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,560
<i>something's going on.</i>

123
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,700
man: yeah,okay,gus.
i understand you got shook up.

124
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,160
anyone would be.

125
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,800
but don't you think it --

126
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,400
don't you think
it had to be a bear?

127
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,960
i know a damn bear track
when i see one!

128
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,900
this thing didn't leave
bear tracks!

129
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,730
its feet were huge!
now,gus --

130
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,700
<i>it was bigfoot,hal --
the bigfoot!</i>

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,200
gus,you're not talking
sense here.

132
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,830
there's a bigfoot out there,
damn it,

133
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,360
and he's a son
of a bitch!

134
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,160
excuse us.

135
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,000
fbi.
what?

136
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,360
yes,sir.
we're here about the...

137
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,760
that.
about bigfoot?

138
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,100
that's right.

139
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,400
sir,can you tell me exactly
where this happened?

140
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,500
yes,i can.

141
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,400
what the hell's going on
in this town?

142
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,460
first there's a ghost
that's not real

143
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,030
and now a bigfoot
sighting?

144
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,960
well,every hunter worth
his salt knows bigfoot's a hoax.

145
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,700
well,maybe somebody's
pumping lsd

146
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,600
into the town
water supply.

147
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,960
okay.

148
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,360
<i>what do you suppose
made that?</i>

149
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,530
that,uh...

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,360
is a big foot.

151
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,060
okay.

152
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,300
so,what -- bigfoot breaks
into a liquor store,

153
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,900
jonesing for some hooch?

154
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,200
amaretto and irish cream.

155
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,330
he's a girl-drink drunk.

156
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,130
hey. check this out.

157
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,760
he took the whole
porno rack?

158
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,930
well,i'll say it again.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,630
what the hell is going on
in this town?

160
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,460
i got nothing.

161
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,660
it's got to be
a joke,right?

162
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,460
some big-ass mother
in a gorilla suit?

163
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,230
or it's a bigfoot.

164
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,860
you know,and he's some kind of
a alcoholo-porno addict.

165
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,330
kind of like
a deep-woods duchovny.

166
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,530
<i>a little young
for busty asian beauties.</i>

167
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,160
what's this,like a
"harry and the hendersons" deal?

168
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,130
hello?

169
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,130
sam: hello!

170
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,600
um,could we...

171
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,230
you know what?
are your parents home?

172
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,330
nope.

173
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,160
no.
no.

174
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,930
um...

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
have you seen
a really,really furry...

176
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,400
is he in trouble?!

177
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,360

<i>makes a wish,
it turns on the well.</i>

357
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,630
then it starts granting wishes
to all comers.

358
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,560
but the wishes get twisted.
you ask for a talking teddy...

359
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,160
you get a bipolar nut job.

360
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,730
and you get e. coli.
mm.

361
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,700
this thing has turned
more than one town

362
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,030
upside down
over the centuries.

363
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,060
it's even wiped a few
off the map.

364
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,400
i mean,one person gets
their wish,it's trouble,

365
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,300
but everybody
gets their wish...
it's chaos.

366
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,630
mm-hmm.

367
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,160
any way to stop it?

368
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,430
yeah. one way.

369
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,530
we got to find
the first wisher.

370
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,030
whoever dropped the coin in
and made the first wish,

371
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,130
they're the only ones
who can pull it back out

372
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,960
and reverse the wishes.

373
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,030
so for now,we've got a couple
of nutso dreams come true,

374
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,400
but once the word gets out
about the well,

375
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,500

crazier and crazier.
