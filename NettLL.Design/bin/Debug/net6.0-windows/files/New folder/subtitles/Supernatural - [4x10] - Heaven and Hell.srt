1
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,297
so, you talk to angels?

2
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:22,562
i just overhear them.

3
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,363
now we know why the demons
want you so bad.

4
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:26,230
this is uriel, a specialist.

5
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:27,363
hello again, dean.

6
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,930
don't you recognize me?

7
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:32,663
but we were so close...
in hell.

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,829
alastair.

9
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:35,596
they're coming.
back room!

10
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:45,729
we're here for anna.

11
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:46,729
are you gonna help her?

12
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,896
she has to die.

13
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:51,397
you want anna?

14
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:52,963
why?

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,696
out of the way.
whoa, whoa, whoa.

16
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,263
okay, i know she's wiretapping
your angel chats or whatever,

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,496
but it's no reason
to gank her.

18
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:01,130
don't worry.
i'll kill her gentle.

19
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:03,330
you're some heartless sons
of bitches, you know that?

20
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,297
as a matter of fact,
we are.

21
00:01:06,363 --> 00:01:07,363
and?

22
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,796
and anna's an innocent girl.

23
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,429
she is far from innocent.

24
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:16,030
what's that supposed
to mean?

25
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:17,562
it means she's worse

26
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,462
than this abomination
you've been screwing.

27
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:21,763
now give us the girl.

28
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,763
sorry.

29
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,529
get yourself another one.

30
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:31,829
try jdate.

31
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:33,996
who's gonna stop us?
you two?

32
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:36,096
or this demon whore?

33
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:51,063
cass, stop...please.

34
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:55,130
i've been waiting for this.

35
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,429
what the...

36
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,130
come on.

37
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:30,130
anna.

38
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,496
anna!

39
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:35,163
are they --
are they gone?

40
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,297
did you kill them?

41
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:37,996
no.

42
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:39,330
i sent them away...

43
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:41,496
far away.

44
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,930
you want to tell me how?

45
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:48,963
that just popped in my head.

46
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,130
i don't know how i did it.

47
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:53,829
i just did it.

48
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,363
so, what do you think?

49
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:09,263
i think anna's getting
more interesting by the second.

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,896
yeah, i agree.

51
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:13,096
and what did they mean by
"she's not innocent"?

52
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:14,729
it seems like
they want her bad,

53
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:16,896
and not just 'cause
of the angel radio thing.

54
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,696
i mean, that blood spell --

55
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,297
some serious crap, man.

56
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:22,263
something's going on
with her.

57
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,562
see what you can find out.
what are you gonna do?

58
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,163
anna may have sent the angels
to the outfield,

59
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,763
but, sooner or later,
they're gonna be back.

60
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,896
we got to get ourselves safe
now.

61
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:41,496
iron walls drenched in salt.

62
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:43,196
demons can't even touch
the joint.

63
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:45,429
which i find racist,
by the way.

64
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:48,030
write your congressman.

65
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,696
here.

66
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,930
x bags?

67
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:54,263
extra-crunchy.

68
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,063
they'll hide us from angels,
demons, all comers.

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,732
thanks, ruby.

70
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,533
don't lose this.

71
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,266
so, anna, what's playing
on angel radio?

72
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,899
anything useful?

73
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,666
it's quiet.

74
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:14,433
dead silence.

75
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,467
good.

76
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,933
that's not troubling
at all.

77
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:21,833
we're in trouble, huh?

78
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,732
you guys are scared?

79
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:30,933
nah.

80
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,799
sam: hey, dean!

81
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:39,799
just stay here, okay?

82
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,899
keep an eye on her.

83
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,732
dean: how's the car?

84
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,966
i got her.
she's fine.

85
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:52,266
where's bobby?

86
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,666
the dominican.

87
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:55,366
he said we break anything,
we buy it.

88
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,999
he's working a job?
god, i hope so.

89
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,266
otherwise, he's at hedonism

90
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,933
in a banana hammock
and a trucker cap.

91
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,200
now that's seared
in my brain.

92
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:02,732
what did you find on anna?

93
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,999
uh, not much.

94
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:07,066
her parents
were rich and amy milton --

95
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,533
a church deacon
and a housewife.

96
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:10,899
riveting.
yeah.

97
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,799
but there is something here
in the report.

98
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:15,166
turns out this latest psych
episode wasn't her first.
no?

99
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,599
when she was 2 1/2,
she'd get hysterical

100
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,133
any time her dad
got close.

101
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,599
she was convinced
that he wasn't her real daddy.

102
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,933
who was?
the plumber, hmm?

103
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,300
a little snaking
the pipes?

104
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,133
dude, you're confusing reality
with porn again.

105
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,699
look, anna didn't say.

106
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:30,033
she just kept repeating

107
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,033
that this real father of hers
was mad.

108
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,433
very mad --
like wanted-to-kill-her mad.

109
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,966
kind of heavy
for a 2-year-old.

110
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,100
well, she saw
a kid's shrink,

111
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,766
got better,
and grew up normal.

112
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,333
until now.
so, what's she hiding?

113
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,899
why don't you just ask me
to my face?

114
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,200
nice job watching her.

115
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:47,233
i'm watching her.

116
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,866
no, you're right, anna.

117
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,533
is there anything
you want to tell us?

118
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,899
about what?

119
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:56,833
the angels said
you were guilty of something.

120
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,300
why would they say that?

121
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,599
you tell me.

122
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,666
tell me why my life
has been leveled...

123
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:04,866
why my parents are dead.

124
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,200
i don't know.

125
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,632
i swear.

126
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,666
i would give anything
to know.

127
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,166
okay.

128
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,200
then let's find out.

129
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,366
how?

130
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,699
we're here!

131
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,933
sam: pamela. hey.

132
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:34,699
sam.
it's me. it's sam.

133
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:35,666
sam?
yeah.

134
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:36,699
sam, is that you?

135
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:37,699
i'm right here.

136
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:38,866
oh.

137
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,732
know how i can tell?

138
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,233
that perky little ass
of yours.

139
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,200
you could bounce a nickel
off that thing.

140
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:49,200
of course i know
it's you, grumpy.

141
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,899
same way i know
that's a demon,

142
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:53,833
and that poor girl's anna.

143
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,500
and that you've been eyeing
my rack.

144
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,166
don't sweat it, kiddo.

145
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,866
i still got more senses
than most.
got it.

146
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:02,966
hey, anna.

147
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,066
how are you?
i'm pamela.

148
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,433
hi.

149
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,033
dean told me
what's been going on.

150
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,500
i'm excited to help.

151
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,400
oh.
that's nice of you.

152
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:11,833
oh, well, not really.

153
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,632
any chance i can dick over
an angel, i'm taking it.

154
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,066
why?

155
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,567
they stole something from me.

156
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:21,166
demon-y, i know.

157
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,933
but they're just plastic.
good for business.

158
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,632
makes me look extra-psychic,
don't you think?

159
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:33,333
now...how about you tell me
what your deal is?

160
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,266
hmm?

161
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,366
don't you worry.

162
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:40,266
pamela: nice and relaxed.

163
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,300
now, i'm going to count down
from five to zero.

164
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:46,999
when we're at zero, you'll be
in a deep state of hypnosis.

165
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:53,799
as i count down,
just go deeper and deeper, okay?

166
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,066
5...

167
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,766
4...

168
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,833
3...

169
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,133
2...

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,333
1.

171
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,833
deep sleep.

172
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:08,300
deep sleep.

173
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:12,799
every muscle
calm and relaxed.

174
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:15,599
can you hear me?

175
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,866
i can hear you.

176
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,799
now, anna, tell me...

177
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,166
how can you hear the angels?

178
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,567
how did you work that spell?

179
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:26,833
i don't know.

180
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,300
i just did.

181
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,300
your father...

182
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:34,666
what's his name?

183
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:37,632
rich milton.

184
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,400
all right.

185
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,999
but i want you
to look further back...

186
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,699
when you were very young...

187
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,999
just a couple of years old.

188
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,266
i don't want to.

189
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,966
it'll be okay.

190
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:52,533
anna, just one look --
that's all we need.

191
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,966
no.

192
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,266
what's your dad's name?

193
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,233
your real dad.

194
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,933
why is he angry at you?

195
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,300
no. no!

196
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,066
no.

197
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,400
no!

198
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,567
calm down.
he's gonna kill me!

199
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,567
anna, you're safe.

200
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,066
calm down.

201
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,966
he's gonna kill me!

202
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,033
anna?
dean, don't.

203
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,833
wake in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

204
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,500
anna...

205
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:26,333
anna...

206
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,066
you all right?

207
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,732
thank you, pamela.

208
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:43,732
that helped a lot.

209
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,300
i remember now.

210
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,799
remember what?

211
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:51,233
who i am.

212
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,699
i'll bite.
who are you?

213
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:58,467
i'm an angel.

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,601
very reassuring.

215
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:10,867
neither do i.

216
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:15,034
so...castiel, uriel --

217
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,668
they're the ones
that came for me?
sam: you know them?

218
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,167
we were kind of
in the same foxhole.

219
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:22,301
so, what, they're like
your bosses or something?

220
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,534
try the other way around.

221
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:27,201
look at you.

222
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,134
but now
they want to kill you?

223
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:30,867
orders are orders.

224
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:34,334
i'm sure i have
a death sentence on my head.

225
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,733
why?

226
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,634
i disobeyed...

227
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,934
which, for us, is about
the worst thing you can do.

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,967
i fell.

229
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:43,067
meaning?

230
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,700
she fell to earth,
became human.

231
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,234
wait a minute.
i don't understand.

232
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:50,000
so, angels
can just become human?

233
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,568
it kind of hurts.

234
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,601
try cutting your kidney out
with a butter knife.

235
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:57,767
that kind of hurt.

236
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,967
i ripped out my grace.

237
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,434
come again?

238
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,467
my grace.

239
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:05,501
it's...energy.

240
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:07,568
hacked it out and fell.

241
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,967
my mother, amy,
couldn't get pregnant.

242
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:14,100
always called me
her little miracle.

243
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,000
she had no idea
how right she was.

244
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,201
so, you just forgot

245
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,601
that you were god's
little power ranger?

246
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:22,334
the older i got,
the longer i was human, yeah.

247
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:25,301
i don't think you all appreciate
how completely screwed we are.

248
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,434
ruby's right.
heaven wants me dead.

249
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,800
and hell just wants her.

250
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:33,134
a flesh-and-blood angel
that you can question, torture,

251
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:34,267
that bleeds.

252
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:36,367
sister,
you're the stanley cup.

253
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,301
and sooner or later, heaven
or hell, they're gonna find you.

254
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,501
i know.

255
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:43,167
and that's
why i'm gonna get it back.

256
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:44,967
what?

257
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,234
my grace.

258
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:48,601
you can do that?
if i can find it.

259
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:52,067
so, what, you're just gonna take
some divine bong hit,

260
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:53,634
and, shazam,
you're roma downey?

261
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,334
something like that.

262
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:57,267
all right.
i like this plan.

263
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,100
so, where's this grace
of yours?

264
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,767
lost track.

265
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,434
i was falling about 10,000 miles
per hour at the time.

266
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:07,367
wait. you mean falling,
like, literally?

267
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,601
yes.

268
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:10,067
like the way
a human eye can see?

269
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:12,367
like a comet maybe
or a meteor?

270
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:13,700
why do you ask?

271
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,201
here. in march '85,
a meteorite

272
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:18,800
vanished in the night sky
over northwestern ohio.

273
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,134
it was sighted nine months
before anna was born,

274
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,867
and she was born
in that part of ohio.

275
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:25,334
you're pretty buff
for a nerd.

276
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:27,733
look, i think it was anna.

277
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,601
and here, same time --
another meteor over kentucky.

278
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,034
and that's her grace?

279
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,534
might be.

280
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:34,833
all right.

281
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,401
that just narrows it down
to an entire state.

282
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,568
look, it's a start.

283
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,568
sam...i'm sorry.

284
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:45,733
for what?

285
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,367
for bringing you this mess.

286
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,401
if i had known,
i would have kept my trap shut.

287
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,934
yeah, well,
we'll muddle through.

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,334
not this time.

289
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,334
you do not want to get
between these two armies.

290
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,668
it's godzilla and mothra.

291
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,167
if one side doesn't get us,
the other one will.

292
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:01,401
so, what do you want to do?
dump anna and run?

293
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:03,867
forget it.

294
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:06,034
look, i know
the angels freak you out.

295
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,334
forget the angels.
it's alastair i'm scared of.

296
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:10,067
alastair?
you met him in the church.

297
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:12,000
practically the grand inquisitor
downstairs.

298
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,467
picasso with a razor.

299
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,267
and?

300
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:21,201
and you should pull him out

301
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,767
and throw him
back in the pit...

302
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,334
if you weren't
so out of shape.
ruby...

303
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:25,934
no, your abilities --
you're getting flabby.

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,301
yeah, so how do i tone up?

305
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,833
you know how.

306
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,134
you know
what you got to do.

307
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:38,301
no, i'm not doing that
anymore.

308
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,733
well, then you better pray
that anna gets her groove back,

309
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,833
or we're all dead.

310
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,401
pamela get home okay?

311
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,301
yeah.
she said she was sorry.

312
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:16,367
it's just after last time,
she, uh...

313
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:19,867
this is just a little too rich
for her blood.

314
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:22,668
i don't blame her.

315
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,501
you guys should do the same.

316
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:27,568
well, we're not that smart.

317
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:32,234
can i ask you something?

318
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,800
what do they want me for?

319
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:42,034
why did they save me?

320
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,967
i'm sorry.

321
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,867
the angels
aren't talking about it.

322
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:48,700
and it was after i fell.

323
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:55,301
that's another question.

324
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,100
why would you fall?

325
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:00,934
why would you want to be
one of us?

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,334
you don't mean that.

327
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,601
i don't?

328
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,134
a bunch
of miserable bastards...

329
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,401
eating, crapping,
confused, afraid.

330
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:09,568
i don't know.

331
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,401
there's loyalty...

332
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:12,934
forgiveness...

333
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,234
love.

334
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,568
pain.
chocolate cake.

335
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,201
guilt.
sex.

336
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,401
yeah, you got me there.

337
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:25,668
i mean it.

338
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,534
every emotion, dean,
even the bad ones...

339
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:32,867
...it's why i fell.

340
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,234
it's why...

341
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:39,201
why i'd give anything
not to have to go back.

342
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,034
anything.

343
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:47,733
feelings are overrated,
if you ask me.

344
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,067
beats being an angel.

345
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:50,601
how's that possible?

346
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:53,501
you guys
are powerful and perfect.

347
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,634
you don't doubt yourselves
or god or anything.

348
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,134
perfect...

349
00:15:58,201 --> 00:15:59,634
like a marble statue.

350
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,601
cold...

351
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,668
no choice...

352
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,000
only obedience.

353
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,700
dean, do you know
how many angels

354
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,267
have actually seen god?

355
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:07,467
seen his face?

356
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,867
all of you?

357
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,100
four angels.

358
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,534
four.

359
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,434
and i'm not one of them.

360
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,367
that's it?

361
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:21,367
well, then how do you
even know that there is a god?

362
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:23,034
we have to take it
on faith...

363
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,000
which we are killed
if we don't have.

364
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,700
huh.

365
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,833
i was stationed on earth
2,000 years.

366
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,733
just...watching...

367
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,733
silent...

368
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,900
invisible...

369
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,267
out on the road...

370
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,234
sick for home...

371
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:47,668
waiting on orders

372
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:50,367
from an unknowable father
i can't begin to understand.

373
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:53,167
so don't tell me that --

374
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:55,201
what is so funny?
what?

375
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,301
nothing. sorry.

376
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,934
it's just...

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
i can relate.

378
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,767
hey.

379
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,800
did you find something?

380
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:13,568
i think so.

381
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,234
union, kentucky.

382
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,800
found some accounts
of a local miracle.

383
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,167
yeah?
yeah.

384
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:22,301
in '85, there was
an empty field outside of town.

385
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,334
six months later,
there was a full-grown oak.

386
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,668
they say it looks a century old
at least.

387
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:27,867
anna,
what do you think?

388
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,334
the grace.

389
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:33,467
where it hit, it could have
done something like that, easy.

390
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:35,634
so grace ground zero --

391
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,634
it's not destruction.
it's...

392
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
pure creation.

393
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:57,733
what?

394
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,067
nothing.

395
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:03,234
it's just an angel and a demon
riding in the backseat.

396
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:06,634
it's like the setup
to a bad joke...

397
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,034
or a penthouse forum letter.

398
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,800
sam: dude...

399
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:11,833
reality...

400
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,067
porn.

401
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,234
you call this reality?

402
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:28,267
it's beautiful.

403
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:31,234
it's where the grace
touched down.

404
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:32,867
i can feel it.

405
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,900
you ready to do this?

406
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,967
not really.

407
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:53,301
anna, what are
we even looking for?

408
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,067
it doesn't matter.

409
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:06,733
it's not here.

410
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,568
not anymore.

411
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:11,401
someone took it.

412
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,901
i say we head back
to the panic room.

413
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:23,934
what, forever?

414
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:25,301
i'm just thinking
out loud!

415
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:26,367
oh, you call that
thinking?

416
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:28,101
hey! hey, hey, hey.
stop it.

417
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,367
anna's grace is gone.
you understand?

418
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:32,701
she can't angel up.
she can't protect us.

419
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,801
we can't fight
heaven and hell.

420
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:36,667
one side maybe, but not both.
not at once.

421
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:37,834
um...guys?

422
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,335
the angels
are talking again.

423
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,367
what are they saying?

424
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,101
it's weird...

425
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:43,567
like a recording...

426
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,101
a loop.

427
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:48,567
it says, "dean winchester

428
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:52,601
gives us anna
by midnight, or..."

429
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:53,734
or what?

430
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:57,868
"or we hurl him
back to damnation."

431
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:01,934
anna...

432
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,068
do you know of any weapon
that works on an angel?

433
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,235
to what?
to kill them?

434
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,567
nothing we could get to...

435
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:11,734
not right now.

436
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:13,801
okay, wait, wait.
i say we call bobby.

437
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:15,335
we get him back
from hedonism.

438
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,101
dean, what's he gonna tell us
that we don't already know?

439
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:19,201
i don't know, but we got to
think of something!

440
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,168
hey.

441
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:28,734
holding up okay?

442
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:29,868
trying.

443
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,034
yeah.

444
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:33,068
a little scared,
i guess.

445
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,868
so, um...

446
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:37,968
dean...

447
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,301
i just wanted to thank you.

448
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,667
for what?

449
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:43,667
everything.

450
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,767
you guys --
you didn't have to help me --

451
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:50,767
hey, let's can the "thanks
for trying" speech, you know?

452
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,235
participation trophies
suck ass.

453
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:55,467
i don't know.

454
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:59,101
maybe i don't deserve
to be saved.

455
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:00,467
don't talk like that.

456
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,701
i disobeyed.

457
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:06,201
lucifer disobeyed.

458
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:08,801
it's our murder one,
and i knew it.

459
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,667
maybe i got to pay.

460
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:14,801
yeah, well, we've all done
things we got to pay for.

461
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,301
i got to tell you something.

462
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,801
you're not gonna like it.

463
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,268
okay. what?

464
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:31,834
about a week ago,
i heard the angels talking...

465
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,101
about you...

466
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,667
what you did in hell.

467
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:38,801
dean, i know.

468
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:46,500
it wasn't your fault.

469
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:48,734
you should forgive yourself.

470
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:52,168
anna, i don't w-want to,
uh...

471
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:55,601
i don't want to...

472
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,335
i can't talk about that.

473
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,367
i know.

474
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:03,068
but when you can,

475
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:05,001
you have people
that want to help.

476
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:07,500
you are not alone.

477
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,168
that's all
i'm trying to say.

478
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:24,901
what was that for?

479
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,934
you know...

480
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,034
our last night on earth...

481
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:31,201
all that.

482
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,634
you're stealing
my best line.

483
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,500
* i'm walking down
this rocky road *

484
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:53,201
* wondering
where my life is leading *

485
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:59,101
* rolling on to the bitter end *

486
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:04,734
* i'm finding out
along the way *

487
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:08,268
* what it takes
to keep love living *

488
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:15,467
* you should know how it feels,
my friend *

489
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:18,034
* oooh *

490
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:22,634
* i want you to stay *

491
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,400
* oooh *

492
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:29,868
* i want you today *

493
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,634
* i'm ready for love *

494
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:36,168
* oh, baby, i'm ready for love *

495
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,934
* ready for love *

496
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:44,034
* oh, baby, i'm ready for love *

497
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:46,101
* yeah *

498
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:48,834
* oh-oh-oh *

499
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:55,134
* for your love *

500
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:01,567
hello, ruby.

501
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,268
alastair.

502
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,767
i have to say,

503
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:09,767
i'm surprised to find you
out in the open like this.

504
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,934
yeah?

505
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,567
desperate times.

506
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:16,268
that they are.

507
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:19,701
you looking for this?

508
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:23,301
your gawky human friend
gave it to me.

509
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,834
keep it.

510
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:26,268
i just came to talk.

511
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:27,767
about what?

512
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,934
about how a demon
is protecting an angel?

513
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,767
we really must revoke
your membership.

514
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,101
look, i know i'm not
employee of the month,

515
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,034
but this --

516
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,235
i never wanted to get
in the middle of this.

517
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:42,068
why are you here, ruby?

518
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:43,667
i'll give you the angel.

519
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:45,467
will you?

520
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:46,534
and in return?

521
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:48,268
i walk away.

522
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:50,601
me and the winchester boys,
both of them.

523
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:53,301
this angel business
is none of our business.

524
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:54,734
hmm.

525
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,434
you know...

526
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,734
i'd always heard

527
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:04,101
that you were a devious,
cowardly little slut.

528
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:07,467
you don't disappoint.

529
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:11,667
so, what do you say?

530
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:12,834
it's interesting...

531
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:14,767
prudent.

532
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:24,001
but, uh...

533
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:28,968
let me make you
a...counteroffer.

534
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:39,001
uriel: look at that.

535
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:42,201
it's so cute
when monkeys wear clothes.

536
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,934
i'm dreaming, aren't i?

537
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,201
it's the only way
we could chat...

538
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:56,634
since you're hiding
like cowards.

539
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,467
don't normally see you
off leash.

540
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,534
where's your boss?

541
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,134
castiel?

542
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:02,901
oh, he, uh...

543
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:04,034
he's not here.

544
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:05,968
see, he has this weakness.

545
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:07,367
he likes you.

546
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,467
time's up, boy.

547
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:13,235
we want the girl.

548
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:14,868
wouldn't try that
if i were you.

549
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,901
see, she got her grace back.

550
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,667
full-blown angel now.

551
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,868
that would be a neat trick,
considering...

552
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:24,834
...i have her grace
right here.

553
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:29,901
we can't let hell
get their hooks into her.

554
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:32,400
well, then why don't you just
give her back her angel juice?

555
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,134
she committed
a serious crime.

556
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,034
what?
thinking for herself?

557
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:37,634
this is our business,
not yours.

558
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:39,801
she's not even human...
not technically.

559
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:43,235
yeah, well, i guess i just like
being a pain in the pooper.

560
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:47,301
no.

561
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,701
there's more.

562
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:59,301
you cut yourself
a slice of...

563
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,767
angel food cake.

564
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,434
didn't you?

565
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,834
huh?

566
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:06,134
you did.

567
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:08,434
what do you care?

568
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,034
you're junkless
down there, right?

569
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:11,268
like a ken doll?

570
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:14,068
ooh.

571
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:18,201
well, it's your last chance.

572
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:20,868
give us the girl, or --
or what?

573
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:25,268
what, you're gonna toss me
back in the hole?

574
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:26,567
you're bluffing.

575
00:28:26,634 --> 00:28:28,268
try me.

576
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,335
this is a whole lot bigger

577
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,134
than the plans
we got for you, dean.

578
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:35,901
you can be replaced.

579
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,567
what the hell?

580
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:49,934
go ahead and do it.

581
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,534
you're just crazy enough to go,
aren't you?

582
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,801
what can i say?
i don't break easy.

583
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,367
oh, yes...

584
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:15,367
...you do.

585
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:18,801
you just got to know where
to apply the right pressure.

586
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,467
alastair: you know the problem
with your generation?

587
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:35,634
instant gratification.

588
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,968
it's all now, now, now.

589
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:41,701
no patience,
no craftsmanship.

590
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:47,201
but i do have to say...

591
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:49,534
this knife of yours...

592
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:52,901
it's an exquisite piece.

593
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:55,168
you must tell me
where you found it.

594
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,268
you know...

595
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:04,901
i haven't been up here
since poland '43.

596
00:30:04,968 --> 00:30:06,667
truth is, i loathe it.

597
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:07,901
it's chilly.

598
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:10,734
no stink of blood
or sizzle of flesh

599
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:12,400
or the wet flap
of flayed skin.

600
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,500
i don't know
how you stand it.

601
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,901
so, the sooner
you cooperate,

602
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:20,335
the sooner i can finish up
with this ghastly angel business

603
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,034
and return home

604
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:24,367
to my studies.

605
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:26,168
but no rush.

606
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:28,767
let's take our time...

607
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:32,268
relish the moment.

608
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:37,634
now,
i'm going to remove this,

609
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:39,601
but don't you go smoking
out of that meat.

610
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,235
you won't get very far.

611
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,400
oh!

612
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:52,235
now you tell me
where that angel is.

613
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:54,367
no.

614
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:55,801
no?

615
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:00,235
no.

616
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:04,567
i tell you, you kill me.

617
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,567
but i'll show you.

618
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,434
i don't know, man.

619
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,134
where's ruby?

620
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:26,934
hey, she's your hell buddy.

621
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:31,934
little early for that,
isn't it?

622
00:31:34,201 --> 00:31:35,901
it's 2:00 a.m. somewhere.

623
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:37,601
you okay?

624
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:39,301
yeah, of course.

625
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:54,034
hello, anna.

626
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:55,534
it's good to see you.

627
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:58,134
sam: how?

628
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,268
how did you find us?

629
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:11,767
dean?

630
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:15,767
i'm sorry.

631
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,001
why?

632
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,500
because they gave him
a choice.

633
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,001
they either kill me...

634
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:27,701
or kill you.

635
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,201
i know how their minds work.

636
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:51,934
you did
the best you could.

637
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,367
i forgive you.

638
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:03,168
okay.

639
00:33:03,235 --> 00:33:05,834
no more tricks.

640
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:09,034
no more running.

641
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,117
i'm ready.

642
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,117
i'm sorry.

643
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:25,583
no. you're not.

644
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,450
not really.

645
00:33:27,517 --> 00:33:29,250
you don't know the feeling.

646
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:33,350
still, we have a history.

647
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:35,151
it's just --
orders are orders.

648
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,316
i know.

649
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,383
just make it quick.

650
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,850
don't you touch a hair
on that poor girl's head.

651
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,151
how dare you
come in this room...

652
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:03,183
you pussing sore?

653
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,817
name-calling.

654
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:08,383
that hurt my feelings...

655
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,583
you sanctimonious,
fanatical prick.

656
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,750
turn around
and walk away now.

657
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:16,117
sure.
just give us the girl.

658
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:19,717
we'll make sure she gets
punished good and proper.

659
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:23,084
you know who we are
and what we will do.

660
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:28,383
i won't say it again.

661
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,583
leave now...

662
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,216
or we lay you to waste.

663
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:35,216
think i'll take my chances.

664
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,784
sorry, kiddo.

665
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,350
why don't you go run
to daddy?

666
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:05,017
aaaaahhhh!

667
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,183
potestas inferna,
me confirma.

668
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,617
potestas inferna,
me confirma.

669
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:16,617
potestas inferma,
me confirma!

670
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,283
dean, dean, dean...

671
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,817
i am so disappointed.

672
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:28,051
you had such promise.

673
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,884
no!

674
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,817
shut your eyes.

675
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:00,583
shut your eyes!

676
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:07,583
shut your eyes!

677
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:43,017
well, what are you guys
waiting for?

678
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:44,417
go get anna...

679
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:46,583
unless, of course,
you're scared.

680
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,650
this isn't over.

681
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:52,283
oh, it looks over to me,
junkless.

682
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,017
you okay?

683
00:37:06,884 --> 00:37:08,417
not so much.

684
00:37:08,483 --> 00:37:10,517
what took you so long
to get here?

685
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,583
sorry i'm late
with the demon delivery.

686
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,817
i was only being tortured.

687
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:18,216
i got to hand it to you,
sammy.

688
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:20,051
bringing them all together
all at once --

689
00:37:20,117 --> 00:37:21,684
angels and demons.

690
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,750
it was a damn good plan.

691
00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:29,283
yeah, well, when you got
godzilla and mothra on your ass,

692
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,784
best to get out of their way
and let them fight.

693
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,383
yeah,
now you're just bragging.

694
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,984
so, i guess she's
some big-time angel now, huh?

695
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:40,250
she must be happy...
wherever she is.

696
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:46,817
i doubt it.

697
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,600
i can't believe we made it out 
of there - again.

698
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,701
i know you heard him.

699
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,033
who?

700
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,233
alastair.

701
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,966
what he said...

702
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:12,200
about how i had promise.

703
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:13,534
i heard him.

704
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
you're not curious?

705
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,767
dean, i'm damn curious.

706
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:20,500
but you're not talking
about hell,

707
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:21,701
and i'm not pushing.

708
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:36,600
it wasn't four months,
you know.

709
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,334
what?

710
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,100
it was four months up here,
but down there...

711
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,667
i don't know.
time's different.

712
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:52,133
it was more like 40 years.

713
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,767
oh, my god.

714
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,667
they, uh...

715
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:05,701
they sliced and carved

716
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:08,300
and tore at me
in ways that you...

717
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,634
...until
there was nothing left.

718
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,966
and then, suddenly...

719
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:23,000
i would be whole again...

720
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:26,734
like magic...

721
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,966
just so they could start in
all over.

722
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,334
and alastair...

723
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,966
at the end of every day...

724
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:37,200
every one...

725
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:39,534
he would come over.

726
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,300
and he would make me
an offer

727
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:45,133
to take me off the rack...

728
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,000
if i put souls on...

729
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,334
...if i started
the torturing.

730
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:56,467
and every day,

731
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:59,133
i told him to stick it
where the sun shines.

732
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,933
for 30 years, i told him.

733
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,233
but then i couldn't do it
anymore, sammy.

734
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,233
i couldn't.

735
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,434
and i got off that rack.

736
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,801
god help me,
i got right off it,

737
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:25,866
and i started
ripping them apart.

738
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:34,033
i lost count
of how many souls.

739
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,367
the --

740
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,933
the things
that i did to them.

741
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,734
dean...

742
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,367
dean, look,
you held out for 30 years.

743
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:56,734
that's longer
than anyone would have.

744
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:15,400
how i feel...

745
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,734
this...

746
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:24,233
inside me...

747
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,767
i wish
i couldn't feel anything, sammy.

748
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:36,133
i wish i couldn't feel
a damn thing.
