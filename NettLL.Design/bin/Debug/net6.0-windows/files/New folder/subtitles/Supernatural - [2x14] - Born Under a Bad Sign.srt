1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,310
Dad wants us to pick
up where he left off

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,700
Saving people, hunting
things, the family business.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,670
My dad had a partner on his last hunt.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,250
The guy screwed up, got my dad killed.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,320
What does this have to do
-It was your father, Dean.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,970
Maybe that's what the demon's doing
-Pushing us, finding ways to break us.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,730
I'm Meg.

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,040
She's possessed --A human
possessed by a demon.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,550
Key of Solomon --You get a demon
in one, they’re trapped, powerless.

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,200
Before dad died, he told
something -Something about you.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,360
He said that I had to save you, and
if I couldn’t, I’d have to kill you.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,860
Did he know the demon's plans for me?

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,580
Am I supposed to go dark side?

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,440
I never said that.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,190
You're not careful; you will
have to waste me one day, Dean.

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,880
Ellen, it’s me again.

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,470
Any chance you've heard from him?

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,090
I swear, it’s like looking
for my dad all over again.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,700
I'm losing my mind here.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,190
I've called him a thousand times.

21
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,240
It's nothing but voice mail.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,990
I don't know where he went or why.

23
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,640
Sam's just gone.

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,780
Hang on.

25
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,440
Sammy, where the hell are you?

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,380
Are you okay?

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,210
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,890
Calm down.

29
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,610
Where are you?

30
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,210
Don't move.

31
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,380
I'm on my way.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,930
Sam, it’s me.

33
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,680
Sam!

34
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,030
Sam?

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,560
Hey.

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,030
Hey, Dean.

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,530
Are you bleeding?

38
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,670
I tried to wash it off.

39
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,990
Oh, my god.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,270
I don't think it’s my blood.

41
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,050
Whose is it?

42
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,100
I don't know.

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,620
Sam, what the hell happened?

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,480
Dean...

45
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,350
I don't remember anything.

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,610
What did you find out?

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,630
You checked in two days ago
under the name Richard sambora.

48
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,320
I think the scariest part about this whole
thing is the fact that you're a bon jovi fan.

49
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,220
Dean.

50
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,550
Your room's been quiet.

51
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,080
Nobody's noticed anything unusual.

52
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,080
You mean no one saw me walking
around covered in blood?

53
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,100
Yeah, that’s what I mean.

54
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,830
Then how the hell did I get here?

55
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,600
What happened to me?

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't know, but you're
okay, and that's what matters.

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,050
Everything else, we can deal with.

58
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,960
Oh, really?

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,440
'Cause what if I hurt someone or worse?

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,610
Sam.

61
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,530
What if this is what
dad warned you about?

62
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,490
Come on, man.

63
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,500
Let's not jump the gun here.

64
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,850
We don't know what happened.

65
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,910
We got to treat this like any other job.

66
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,400
What's the last thing you remember?

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,040
Me and you in that
motel room in west Texas.

68
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,390
We went out to grab some burgers.

69
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,700
West Texas -That was over a week ago.

70
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,270
That's it.

71
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,430
Next thing I knew, I was sitting here...

72
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,890
Bloody.

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,340
I felt like I had been
asleep for a month.

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,140
Okay, retrace your steps.

75
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,110
Manager said you left yesterday
afternoon and never saw you come back.

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,240
Hey.

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,620
Recognize anything?

78
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,440
Not really.

79
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,400
Wait.

80
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,770
What?

81
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,960
I think I was here.

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,070
You remember?

83
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,590
Not really. It just...

84
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
Feels familiar, you know?

85
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,900
Try that one.

86
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah.

87
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,130
Okay.

88
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,110
Wait.

89
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,530
Please tell me you didn't steal this.

90
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,610
More blood.

91
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,370
Sam, backseat.

92
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,700
You think I used this on someone?

93
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,590
I'm not thinking anything.

94
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,500
Okay, now, this is disturbing.

95
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,270
Come on, man.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,480
This couldn't have been you.

97
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,360
It could have been someone else
-Somebody who, uh, smokes menthols.

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,510
Hey, a gas receipts, a few towns over.

99
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,100
All right, receipt’s for10
gallons at pump number 2.

100
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,470
You getting any goose bumps yet?

101
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,790
"God, this looks familiar,"déjavu vibes?

102
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,790
Maybe someone inside will remember you.

103
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,670
Come on.

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,210
You -Out of here.

105
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,760
Now.

106
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,740
I'm calling the cops.

107
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,650
You talking to him?

108
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,900
Yeah, I’m talking to him.

109
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,240
Jerk comes in yesterday, stinking drunk,
grabs a 40 from the fridge, starts chugging it.

110
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,930
This guy?

111
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,330
You're drinking malt liquor?

112
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,080
Not after he whipped the
bottle at my friggin' head.

113
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,240
This guy?

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,970
What, am I speaking Urdu?

115
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,270
I'm really sorry if I did anything
tell your story walking, pal, okay?

116
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,260
Popo will be here in five.

117
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,820
Wait.

118
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,780
He's leaving.

119
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,740
Put the phone down.

120
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,090
Sam, go wait in the car.

121
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,660
But, Dean  go wait in the car!

122
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,670
Okay, look, I just want to
talk to you that are it, okay?

123
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,550
When he took off yesterday,
which way did he go?

124
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,710
Why don't you ask him?

125
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,060
'Cause I'm asking you.

126
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,660
Please, you’d be doing
mea huge favor, okay?

127
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,310
Oh, do you a favor.

128
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,310
Well, that is what I live for.

129
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,690
You know, your buddy didn't pay for the booze
or the smokes, which he also illegally lit up.

130
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,840
You saw him smoking?

131
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah, guy’s a chimney.

132
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,530
This, uh...

133
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,820
Ought to cover it.

134
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,830
Hmm, it’s, uh, it’s
coming back to me now.

135
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,780
He took two packs.

136
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,750
Of course he did.

137
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,790
Heent north on route
71, straight out of town.

138
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,280
What's going on with you, sam, hmm?

139
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,460
The smoking, throwing bottles at people
-That sounds more like me than you.

140
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,210
Dean, wait.

141
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,360
Wait. Here.

142
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,370
Turn down that road.

143
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:00,850
What?

144
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,450
I don't know how I know.

145
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,390
I just do.

146
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Whoever lives here, I’d say
they don't like surprises.

147
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,890
Should we knock?

148
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,990
Yeah, I guess.

149
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,440
Hey, Dean.

150
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,430
I'm surprised the cops didn’t show -Place
like this you'd think would have an alarm.

151
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,050
Yeah, you would.

152
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,170
Hit the lights.

153
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,040
Dean, I did this.

154
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,810
We don't know that.

155
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,860
What else do you need?

156
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,820
How else do you explain the
car, the knife, the blood?

157
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,320
I don't know, man.

158
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,540
Why don't you tell me?

159
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,570
Even if you did do this, I’m sure you had a reason -You
know, self-Defense, he was a bad son of a bitch --Something.

160
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,260
He doesn't have any I.D.

161
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,780
I need your lock pick.

162
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,430
What?

163
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,680
I need your lock pick.

164
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,000
Either this guy’s a
Unabomber -Or a hunter.

165
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,370
Dean, I think I killed a hunter.

166
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,790
Let's find out.

167
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,810
Here we go.

168
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,750
How do you erase this, huh?

169
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,920
Sam, come on.

170
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,110
I need your help.

171
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,590
I killed him, Dean.

172
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,540
I just broke in and killed him.

173
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,930
Listen to me.

174
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,380
Whoever this guy is, he’s a hunter, which means
other hunters are gonna look for his killer,

175
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,590
Which means we got to
cover our tracks, okay?

176
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,530
His name was Steve Wandell.

177
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,930
This is a letter from his daughter.

178
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,620
Wipe your prints. Then we go.

179
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,190
All right, we get a couple hours' sleep, and
then we put this place in our rearview mirror.

180
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,720
I know this is bad, okay?

181
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,730
You got to snap out of it.

182
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,590
Sam, say something.

183
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,570
Just get some sleep and
leave in the morning?

184
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,410
Murder, Dean
--That's what I did.

185
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,760
Maybe, okay?

186
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,470
Hey, we don't
--Shapeshifter.

187
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,580
Oh, come on.

188
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,240
You know it wasn’t.

189
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,930
You saw the tape.

190
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,480
There was no eye flare, no distortion.

191
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,560
But it wasn't you, all right?

192
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Yeah, it might have been
you, but it wasn't you.

193
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,090
Well, I think it was.

194
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,300
I think maybe more than you know.

195
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,890
What the hell does that mean?

196
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,090
For the last few weeks,
I’ve been having...

197
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,450
I've been having these feelings.

198
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,310
What feelings?

199
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,360
Rage...

200
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,730
Hate.

201
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,100
And I can't stop it.

202
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,940
It just gets worse.

203
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,650
Day by day, it gets worse.

204
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,260
You never told me this.

205
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,650
I didn't want to scare you.

206
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,330
Well, bang-Up job on that.

207
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,610
Dean, the yellow-Eyed demon
-You know he has plans for me.

208
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,620
And we both know that he’s turned
other children into killers before, too.

209
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,380
No one can control you but you.

210
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,340
It sure doesn't seem like that, Dean.

211
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,850
It feels like no matter what I do, slowly
but surely, I’m just becoming --What?

212
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,730
Who I'm meant to be.

213
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,020
You said it onceyourself, Dean.

214
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,220
I got to face up to who I am.

215
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,100
I didn't mean this!

216
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,450
But it's still true.

217
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,670
You know that.

218
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,730
Dad knew that, too.

219
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,970
That's why he told you
if it ever came to this

220
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,920
Shut up, Sam.

221
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,720
Dean, you promised him.

222
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,690
You promised me.

223
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,350
No.

224
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,400
Listen to me.

225
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,920
We're gonna figure this out, okay?

226
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,120
I mean, there’s got to be a way, right?

227
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,530
Yeah, there is.

228
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,050
I don't want to hurt anyone else.

229
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,580
I don't want to hurt you.

230
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,230
You won’t.

231
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,570
Whatever this is, you can fight it.

232
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,750
No, I can’t...

233
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,710
Not forever.

234
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,780
Here. You got to do it.

235
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,380
You know, I’ve tried so
hard to keep you safe.

236
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,940
I know.

237
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,710
I can’t.

238
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,260
I'd rather die.

239
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,940
No.

240
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,330
You'll live.

241
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,090
You'll live to regret this.

242
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,960
It's past your checkout.

243
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,220
What?

244
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,320
It's past checkout, and I have a
couple here that need your room.

245
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,940
Yeah, I’ll bet they do.

246
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,430
What time is it?

247
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,600
12:30.

248
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,340
The guy that was with
me --Have you seen him?

249
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,030
Yeah, he left before dawn in your car, and you should have
gone with him because now I'm gonna have to charge you extra.

250
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,270
Oh, son of a bitch.

251
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,660
It's just policy, sir.

252
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,280
I need to use your computer.

253
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,960
Why would I let you use my computer?

254
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,160
Hi.

255
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,570
Uh, so sorry to bother you, but, uh, my
son snuck out of the house last night and,

256
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,080
Uh, went to a Justin Timberlake concert.

257
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,030
What?

258
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,770
Yeah.

259
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,810
Justin is quite the triple threat.

260
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,790
Uh, anyway, he’s not back
yet, and I'm starting to worry.

261
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,520
Right, yeah, boys will be boys.

262
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,790
But, see, Sammy is a...

263
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,100
Diabetic, and if he doesn't get his
insulin, then I just --I have to find him.

264
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,270
Please, I’m begging you.

265
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,390
No, no, no, I’m on
the website right now.

266
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,620
I just need to activate
the GPS on his cellphone.

267
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,120
Yeah, right there.

268
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,680
Duluth, Minnesota.

269
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,800
Yeah, that is a long
way to go for a concert.

270
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,900
I appreciate your help.

271
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,870
Night.

272
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,940
Thank you.

273
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Sorry, we’re closing up.

274
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,450
How about just one for the road?

275
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,220
Well, you’re about the last
person I'd expect to see.

276
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,760
Well...

277
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,990
I guess I'm full of surprises.

278
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,950
So, can I get a beer?

279
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,930
Sure.

280
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,630
One beer.

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,330
So, how’d you find me?

282
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,750
Well, uh, it’s kind of
what we do, you know?

283
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,620
Speaking of "we,?Where’s Dean?

284
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,910
Couldn't make it.

285
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,980
So, what are you doing here, Sam?

286
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,050
We didn't exactly part
on the best of terms.

287
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,620
Right.

288
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,690
That’s why I'm here.

289
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,560
I kind of wanted to see if we
could square things, you know?

290
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,680
That looks like it hurts.

291
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,540
No.

292
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,940
No, just...

293
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,580
Had a run-In with a hot stove.

294
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,650
So, you were saying something
about squaring things?

295
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,670
Yeah.

296
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,010
Look, I know how you feel about my
dad, and I can't say I blame you.

297
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,840
He was obsessed, consumed with hunting, and
he didn't care who got caught in the crossfire.

298
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,040
And I guess that included your dad.

299
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,440
But that was my father.

300
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,720
That's not me.

301
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,990
What about Dean?

302
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,950
Well, Dean’s more like my
father than I am, but he...

303
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,360
Boy...

304
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,670
You’re really carrying a
torch for him, aren’t you?

305
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,820
I'll take that as a yes.

306
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,140
It's too bad.

307
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,170
'Cause, see, Dean, he
likes you, sure, but...

308
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,650
Not in the way you'd want.

309
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:11,640
I mean, maybe as kind of a little sister,
but romance -That's just out of the question.

310
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,800
He Kind of thinks you’re
a schoolgirl, you know?

311
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,940
I'm not trying to hurt you, Jo.

312
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,600
I -I'm telling you ‘cause I care.

313
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,290
That's real kind of you, Sam.

314
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,370
I mean it.

315
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,830
I care about you a lot.

316
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,100
Sam, what’s going on?

317
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,190
I can be more to you, Jo.

318
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Maybe you should leave.

319
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,550
Okay.

320
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,980
Sam, get off me!

321
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,740
Sam, get off me!

322
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,800
Let go.

323
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,750
Jo, Jo, Jo.

324
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,940
Sam, no, pleases!

325
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,760
Please.

326
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,340
It didn't have to be this way.

327
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,450
Maybe it did.

328
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,890
What the hell's going on?

329
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,940
What are you doing?

330
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,260
So, what exactly did your mom
tell you about how your dad died?

331
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,080
You're not Sam.

332
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,390
Don't be so sure about that.

333
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,420
Answer the question....

334
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,860
Come on.

335
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,400
It's me.

336
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,940
You can tell me anything.

337
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,060
You know that.

338
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,450
Answer the question.

339
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,240
Fine.

340
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,370
Fine.

341
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,740
Our dads were in California
-Devil's gate reservoir.

342
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,140
They were setting a trap
for some kind of hell spawn.

343
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,630
John was hiding, waiting,
and my dad was bait.

344
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,950
That's just like john.

345
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,270
Oh, I bet he dangled
bill like meat on a hook.

346
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,060
Then what?

347
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,050
The thing showed up.

348
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,880
John got too eager, jumped out too soon,
and got my dad exposed out in the open.

349
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,110
The thing turned around...

350
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,310
And killed him.

351
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,690
Not quite.

352
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,600
What?

353
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,610
What?

354
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,820
See, it hurt him.

355
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,250
It didn't kill him.

356
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,690
You really don't know the truth, do you?

357
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,120
I bet your momdoesn't, either.

358
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,350
Know what?

359
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,700
You see, bill...

360
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,480
Was all clawed up.

361
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,950
He was holding his insides in his hands.

362
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,530
He was gargling and...

363
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,030
Praying to see you and
Ellen one more time.

364
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,890
So my dad...

365
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,510
Killed him.

366
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,730
He put him out of his
misery like a sick dog.

367
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,330
You're lying.

368
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,770
I'm not.

369
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,760
It's true.

370
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,570
My daddy shot your daddy in the head

371
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,900
How could you know that?

372
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,870
I hear things.

373
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,480
Why are you doing this to me?

374
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,710
Like daddy, like daughter.

375
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,450
You're bait.

376
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,280
Open up.

377
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,970
That's a girl.

378
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,070
Sam!

379
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,400
I begged you to stop me, Dean!

380
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,510
Put the knife down, damn it.

381
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,190
I told you I can't fight it!

382
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,960
My head feels like
it’s on fire, all right?

383
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,200
Dean, kill me, or I'm gonna kill her.

384
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,020
Please.

385
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,200
You'd be doing me a favor.

386
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,720
Shoot me.

387
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,160
Shoot me!

388
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,780
No, sammy.Come on.

389
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,190
What the hell’s wrong with you, Dean?

390
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,710
Are you that scared of being
alone that you'd rather let Jo die?

391
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,130
That's holy water, you
demonic son of a bitch!

392
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,800
He was possessed?

393
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Dean!

394
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,200
So, who are you? I got lots of names.

395
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,800
You've been in Sam since
he Disappeared, haven’t you?

396
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,600
Should have seen your face when you
thought He murdered that guy. Pathetic.

397
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,900
Why didn't you kill me?
You had a dozen chances.

398
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,100
No, that would have been too
easy. Where's the fun in that?

399
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,000
See, this was a test. I wanted to see If
I could push you far enough to waste Sam.

400
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,200
I should have known you
wouldn't have the sack.

401
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,700
Anyway, fun’s over now.

402
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,000
Well, I hope you got your kicks
'cause you're gonna pay hell for this.

403
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,900
How? You can't hurt me
- Not without hurting your little brother.

404
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:44,500
See, I think you're gonna die, Dean
- You and every other hunter I can find.

405
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,100
One look at Sam’s dewy, sensitive eyes,
And they'll let me right in that door.

406
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
This is Dean. Leave a message.

407
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,900
Dean!

408
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,900
Dean!

409
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,500
Take it easy.

410
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,100
Where's Sam? I don't know.
I’ve been looking for you.

411
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,800
Come on. Get up.

412
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,100
Okay. Don’t be a baby!

413
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
God.

414
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,200
All right, almost. All
right, got it. Got it.

415
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,200
God, you’re a butcher. You're welcome.

416
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,900
All right, are we done? Would you
give me two minutes to patch you up?

417
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,800
You can't help Sam if
you're bleeding to death.

418
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,700
So, how did you know
that he was possessed?

419
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,400
I didn’t. I just knew that
It couldn't have been him.

420
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,700
Hey, Dean. Yeah.

421
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,100
I know demons lie, But do
they ever tell the truth, too?

422
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,700
Yeah, sometimes, I guess, especially
If they know it'll mess with your head.

423
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,300
Why do you ask?

424
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,700
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

425
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,900
So, do you have any idea?
Where he's headed to next?

426
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,300
So far, he’s been going after the nearest hunter,
So, the closest one I know is in South Dakota.

427
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,600
Okay, good. I’m done. Let’s go.

428
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,600
You're not coming. The hell
I'm not. I’m a part of this now.

429
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,000
I can't say it more plain than this you try and
follow me, And I'll tie you right back to that post.

430
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,200
This is my fight. I’m not
getting Your blood on my hands.

431
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,000
That's just how it's gonna be.

432
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,600
Wait. Here.

433
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,300
Take these. They’ll help with the pain.

434
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,400
Thanks.

435
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I'll call you later, okay?

436
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,400
No, you won’t.

437
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,200
Damn it.

438
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
Sam. Hey, bobby.

439
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,600
It's been a while. Come on in.

440
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,100
So, what brings you? Working a job nearby,
and I thought I'd stop in and say hey.

441
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Where's Dean?

442
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Holed up somewhere with
a girl and a 12-Pack.

443
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Oh, yeah? Is she pretty? You ask
me, he’s in way over his head.

444
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
Well, it’s good to see you.

445
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,600
To john.

446
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
To dad.

447
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,600
What'd you do? Little
holy water in the beer.

448
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,100
Sam never would have noticed,
But, then, you’re not Sam, are you?

449
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Don't try to con a con man.

450
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,100
Ugh!

451
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,500
Dean. Back from the dead.

452
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,300
Getting to be a regular
thing for you, isn’t it?

453
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,200
Like a cockroach.

454
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,900
How about I smack that smart-Ass
Right out of your mouth?

455
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Careful now.

456
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,200
Wouldn't want to bruise this fine packaging
Oh, don’t worry. This isn't gonna hurt Sam much.

457
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,800
You, on the other hand...

458
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,300
Feel like talking now?

459
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Sam's still my meat puppet.

460
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,700
I'll make him bite off his tongue.
No, you won't be in him long enough.

461
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Bobby.

462
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Ee, whatever bitch-Boy master plan you demons Are
cooking up, you’re not getting Sam, you understand me?

463
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,700
'Cause I'm gonna kill
every one of you first.

464
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,300
You really think that's what this is about
- The master plan?

465
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,100
I don't give a rat's ass
about the master plan.

466
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,900
Oops.Doesn't seem to be working.

467
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,600
See, I learned a few new tricks.

468
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,200
This isn't going like I
pictured. What's going on, bobby?

469
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,500
It's a binding link!

470
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,500
It's like a lock. It’s locked
Itself inside Sam’s body.

471
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,100
What the hell do we do? I don't know!

472
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,800
There. That’s better.

473
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,400
You know when people want to
describe The worst possible thing...

474
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,800
They say it's like hell?

475
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,000
Well, there’s a reason for
that. Hell is like, uh...

476
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Well, it’s like hell, even for demons.

477
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:49,600
It's a prison made of bone
and Flesh and blood and fear.

478
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,800
And you sent me back there.

479
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,000
Meg. No...Not anymore.

480
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,900
Now I'm Sam.

481
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,700
By the way...

482
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,500
I saw your dad there. He says "howdy."

483
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:18,200
All that I had to hold on to was that I would
Climb out one day and that I was gonna torture you,

484
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Nice and slow, like pulling
the wings off an insect.

485
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,900
But whatever I do to you, it’s nothing
compared To what you do to yourself, is it?

486
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,500
I can see it in your eyes, Dean.

487
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,300
You're worthless. You
couldn't save your dad

488
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,800
And deep down, you know that
You can't save your brother.

489
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,900
They'd have been better off without you.

490
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,600
Sammy?

491
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,800
Did I miss anything?

492
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,500
By the way, you really
look like crap, Dean.

493
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Yeah, right back at you.

494
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,500
What is it, bobby?

495
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,600
You boys ever hear of a
hunter Named Steve Wandell?

496
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,800
Why do you ask?

497
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Just heard from a friend, wandell’s dead
- Murdered in his own house.

498
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
You wouldn't know anything about that.

499
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,300
No, sir.Never heard of the guy. Dean.

500
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,900
Good. Keep it that way.

501
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,800
Wandell's buddies are looking for
Someone or something to string up.

502
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,700
They're not gonna slow
down to listen to reason.

503
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
You understand what I'm saying?

504
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,500
We better hit the road...

505
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,700
If, uh, you can remember
where we parked the car.

506
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,800
Here. Take these.

507
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,400
What are they? Charms.
They’ll fend off possession.

508
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,700
That demon's still out there. This will
Stop it from getting back up in you.

509
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,700
That sounds vaguely dirty,
but, uh, thanks. You're welcome.

510
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,000
You boys be careful, now. You too.

511
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,400
You okay?

512
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,700
Sam?

513
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,800
Is that you in there?

514
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,600
I was awake for some of it, Dean.

515
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:38,300
I watched myself kill Wandell with my own
two hands. I saw the light go out in his eyes.

516
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,200
It must have been awful.

517
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
That's not my point.

518
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
I almost carved up jota.

519
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,500
But no matter what I
did, you wouldn't shoot.

520
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,600
It was the right move,
sam.It wasn't you.

521
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,600
Yeah, this time. What about next time?

522
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:12,000
Sam, when dad told me that I might have to
kill you, It was only if I couldn't save you.

523
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,500
Now, if it's the last thing
I do, I'm gonna save you.

524
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,400
What?

525
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,500
Nothing.

526
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,500
Dean, what?

527
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,300
Dude, you, like, full-On had a girl
inside you for, Like, a whole week.

528
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,700
That's pretty naughty.
