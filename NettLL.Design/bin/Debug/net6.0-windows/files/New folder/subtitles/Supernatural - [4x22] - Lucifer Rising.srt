1
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,979
- Who are you?
- Castiel, an angel of the Lord.

2
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,816
I've got demon blood in me, Dean!
I'm a whole new level of freak!

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:30,112
Lilith is trying to break
the 66 seals to free Lucifer from hell.

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,322
And why would an angel
rescue me from Hell?

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,408
We have work for you.

6
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,748
She's no nurse.
She's Lilith's personal chef.

7
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,543
- Sucking blood? You know that's wrong.
- I wish to God I could stop.

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,260
You give yourself over wholly
to the service of God and his angels?

9
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,678
Yes, I swear.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,473
You're an angel?
- I'm Zachariah.

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,936
This man is a prophet of the Lord.

12
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,947
I'm not drinking
the demon blood for kicks.

13
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,575
She's poison, Sam.
Look what she did to you.

14
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,664
You walk out that door,
don't you ever come back.

15
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,816
No, no, no!

16
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,453
Our father who art in heaven...

17
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,330
...hallowed be thy name.

18
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,666
Thy kingdom come,
blah, blah, blah...

19
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,085
Lead us not into temptation...

20
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,422
...but deliver us from evil.

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,637
Truer words never spoken,
huh, Sisters?

22
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,559
But sometimes it seems
as if it's difficult to know the creator.

23
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:28,313
Sometimes I feel,
in a very literal sense...

24
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,984
...that I have been wandering
the desert for years...

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,986
...looking for our father.

26
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,532
Well, not our father.

27
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,910
My father. See, he's in jail.

28
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,203
Your dad put him there.

29
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,874
I almost gave up hope.

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,293
But ye of little faith.

31
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,128
Because I finally found him.

32
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,464
Or at least, you know,
the spot where his cage door opens.

33
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,550
It's right here.

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,220
In a damn convent, for God's sake.

35
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,682
- Life is funny.
- Uh, Father?

36
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,019
Shut your frigging pie hole,
you little slut!

37
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,111
Then again, I suppose it makes sense.

38
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:21,825
Folks forget,
my daddy is an angel, after all.

39
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,118
Or was.

40
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,413
I mean, I suppose
some dumb bastard stood here...

41
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,917
...felt a jolt of his holy juice
and thought...

42
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,419
..."I'm gonna build me a nun factory. "

43
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,465
Well...

44
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,759
...it's the right idea...

45
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,761
...wrong angel.

46
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,771
So, um...

47
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,982
...if any of you gals
are the praying type...

48
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,735
...now would be a good time to start.

49
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,406
Help!

50
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,192
Sam?

51
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,821
Your head in the game here?

52
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,826
I'm good. Let's go.

53
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,330
Are you okay?

54
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,627
I just said I was.

55
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,089
Look, I know handholding
really isn't my thing...

56
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,633
...but Dean was wrong,
saying what he said to you.

57
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,343
No, he was right to say it.

58
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,681
- I don't blame him, after what I did.
- After, you guys will patch things up.

59
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,434
- You always do.
- You're talking like I got an after.

60
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,810
Don't say that.

61
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,857
I can feel it inside me, Ruby.

62
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,525
I've changed.

63
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,819
For good.

64
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,822
There's no going back now.

65
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,949
- Sam.
- Look...

66
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,909
...I know what I gotta do.

67
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,579
It's okay. I'm just saying...

68
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,958
...Dean's better off
as far away from me as possible.

69
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,671
Anyways, doesn't matter.
Let's just get this done with.

70
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,602
Dean?

71
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,897
Dean.

72
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,691
You listen to a word I said?

73
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,984
Yeah, I heard you.

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,404
I'm not calling him.

75
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,406
Don't make me get my gun, boy.

76
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,825
We are damn near kickoff
for Armageddon.

77
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,744
We got bigger fish at the moment.

78
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,414
I know you're pissed and I'm not
making apologies. But he's your-

79
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,501
Blood? He's my blood?
Is that what you're gonna say?

80
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,462
He's your brother and he's drowning.

81
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,465
Bobby, I tried to help him. I did.

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,134
- Look what happened.
- So try again.

83
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,723
No, it's too late.

84
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,644
- There's no such thing.
- No, damn it.

85
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,815
No. We gotta face the facts.

86
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,651
Sam never wanted part of this family.

87
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,569
He hated this life growing up.

88
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,114
Ran away to Stanford
first chance he got.

89
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,492
Now it's like déjà vu all over again.

90
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,578
Well, I am sick...

91
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,664
...and tired of chasing him.

92
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,291
Screw him. He can do what he wants.

93
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,169
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do, Bobby.

94
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,130
Sam's gone.

95
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,423
He's gone.

96
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,927
I'm not even sure
if he's still my brother anymore.

97
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,473
If he ever was.

98
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,777
You stupid, stupid son of a bitch!

99
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,740
Well, boohoo, I am so sorry
your feelings are hurt, princess.

100
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,369
You under the impression that family's
supposed to make you feel good?

101
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,121
Bake you an apple pie, maybe?

102
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,374
They're supposed to make you miserable!
That's why they're family!

103
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,169
I told him, "You walk out that door,
don't come back. "

104
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,628
And he walked out anyway.

105
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,005
That was his choice.

106
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,467
You sound like a whiny brat.

107
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,219
No.

108
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,138
You sound like your dad.

109
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,223
Well, let me tell you something.

110
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,477
Your dad was a coward.

111
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,231
My dad was a lot of things,
but a coward?

112
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,318
He'd rather push Sam away
than reach out to him.

113
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,321
Well, that don't strike me as brave.

114
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,660
You are a better man
than your daddy ever was.

115
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,164
So you do both of us a favor.

116
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,750
Don't be him.

117
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,279
Hello, Dean.

118
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,325
It's almost time.

119
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,042
We're gonna take you
to the nursery, sugar.

120
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,503
Let mommy and daddy
get some sleep.

121
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,089
He's a beautiful child.

122
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,341
Absolutely scrumptious.

123
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:18,306
Pattycake, pattycake, baker's man

124
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,893
Bake me a cake as fast as you can

125
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,521
Pat it, and roll it

126
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,648
And mark it with a B

127
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,567
And put it in the oven-

128
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,955
So we need to talk.

129
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,992
Hello, Dean.

130
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,493
You're looking fit.

131
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,081
Well, how about this.

132
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,916
The Suite Life of Zach and Cass.

133
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,588
It's a-

134
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,548
Never mind.

135
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,718
- So, what is this? Where the hell am I?
- Call it a green room.

136
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,928
We're closing in
on the grand finale here.

137
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,140
Wanna keep you safe
before showtime.

138
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,601
Try a burger. They're your favorite.

139
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,896
From that sea-side shack in Delaware.
You were 11, I think.

140
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,565
- I'm not hungry.
- No?

141
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,526
How about Ginger
from season two of Gilligan's Island?

142
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,945
You do have a thing for her,
don't you?

143
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,699
Tempting. Weird.

144
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,994
- We'll throw in Mary Ann for free.
- No, no, it's...

145
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,456
Bail on the Holodeck, okay?
I wanna know what the game plan is.

146
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,291
Let us worry about that.

147
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,419
We want you focused, relaxed.

148
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:16,549
Well, I'm about to be pissed and leaving,
so start talking, chuckles.

149
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,180
All the seals have fallen...

150
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,057
...except one.

151
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:29,187
That's an impressive score. That's right
up there with the Washington Generals.

152
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,774
You think sarcasm's appropriate, do you?
Considering...

153
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,901
...you started all this?

154
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,738
But the final seal...

155
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,243
...it'll be different.

156
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,994
Why?

157
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,125
Lilith has to break it.
She's the only one who can.

158
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,751
Tomorrow. Midnight.

159
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,461
- Where?
- We're working on that.

160
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,256
- Well, work harder.
- We'll do our job. You do yours.

161
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,966
Yeah, and what is that, exactly?

162
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,510
I'm the one that stops her. How?
With the knife?

163
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,721
- All in good time.
- Isn't now a good time?

164
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,472
- Have faith.
- What, in you?

165
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,142
Give me one good reason
why I should.

166
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,147
Because you swore your obedience.

167
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,943
So obey.

168
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,464
What, no devil's trap?

169
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,050
- I don't need one.
- Look at you, all roided up.

170
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,386
It's like ARod and Madonna
over here.

171
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,721
Where's Lilith?

172
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,516
- I'm not scared of you.
- Yeah, you are, actually.

173
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,976
And with good reason.

174
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,481
Look, what's my upside?

175
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,901
Okay, I tell you, you kill me.
I don't tell you, you still kill me.

176
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,905
I get away somehow, Lilith will
definitely kill me. So where's my carrot?

177
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:06,618
I think what you should be worrying
about is what happens before you die.

178
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,848
Ah, screw it.

179
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,940
It's Sam, leave me a message.

180
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,611
Hey. It's me, uh...

181
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,574
Ahem. Look, I'll just get right to it.

182
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,910
I'm still pissed...

183
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,288
...and I owe you a serious beat down.

184
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,290
But...

185
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,171
...I shouldn't have said what I said.

186
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,591
You know, I'm not dad.

187
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,929
We're brothers, you know.
We're family.

188
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,931
And, uh...

189
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,685
...no matter how bad it gets,
that doesn't change.

190
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,354
Sammy, I'm sorry-

191
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,792
- Stop. Stop. Please.
- You'll tell me where she is?

192
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,713
- Fine, fine. Just let me die.
- Deal.

193
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,553
Tomorrow night. Midnight.

194
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,555
She's gonna be at a convent.

195
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,266
St. Mary's. Ilchester, Maryland.

196
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,185
- A convent?
- Lilith.

197
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,229
She's gonna break the final seal.

198
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,982
- And what is the final seal?
- I don't know.

199
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,693
Aah, I don't know! I don't know!

200
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,362
I don't know, I swear.

201
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,990
Oh, please.

202
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,618
I'm begging you. Kill me, please.

203
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,119
Fine.

204
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,289
- Wait. You can't.
- Why not?

205
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,835
We gotta take her. It's the final run
on the Death Star. You need more juice.

206
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,128
You promised.

207
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,256
Sorry, sister. You're a walking,
talking can of whup-ass.

208
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,133
- You bitch.
I know.

209
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,677
Just can't trust anyone these days.

210
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,064
Well, least you won't be able
to crack me open that easy.

211
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,483
- That so?
- Don't forget...

212
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,735
...it's not just me you're bleeding.

213
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:50,073
In fact, I think I'm gonna take
a little siesta in the subconscious...

214
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,659
...hand over the wheel for a little bit.

215
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,704
- What are you talking about?
- Cindy McCellen, R.N.

216
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,208
Come on down.

217
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,971
What?

218
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,767
Where am I?

219
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,811
Huh?

220
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,438
Oh, my God. I can't move.

221
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,940
What's going on?

222
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,234
Help.

223
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,653
Help me, please.

224
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,322
Great.

225
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,548
Father, look.

226
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,843
I'm not exactly the praying type,
but still...

227
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,722
...I made the sacrifice.
I got you a bag full of nuns.

228
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,224
So, uh...

229
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,643
...can you hear me?

230
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,522
Can you whisper through the door?

231
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,792
I'm here, my son.

232
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,212
It's so good to hear your voice, Padre.

233
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,633
I have been searching for you
for so long, you have no idea.

234
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,970
The others have lost faith.

235
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,765
Dickless heathens.

236
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,642
- But not me.
- You've done well.

237
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,146
So, uh...

238
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,106
...how do I bust you out?

239
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,775
Lilith.

240
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,985
Lilith?

241
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:57,909
Father, she's trapped
neck deep in the pit.

242
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,577
Won't be easy.

243
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,704
Lilith.

244
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,207
Lilith can break the seals.

245
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,502
Yeah, okay.

246
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,421
But what do I do?

247
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,466
You must find me a child.

248
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,636
A very special child.

249
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,265
What do you mean?

250
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,185
What child?

251
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,397
You gotta be kidding me.

252
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,358
What?
Get this.

253
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:35,154
"St. Mary's abandoned in '72
after a priest disemboweled eight nuns. "

254
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,698
What's black and white
and red all over?

255
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,701
That's not funny.
The priest said it wasn't his fault.

256
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,080
He said a demon made him do it.
He remembered the demon's name.

257
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,748
- Yeah?
- Azazel.

258
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:52,338
Wow, so Lilith, Yellow Eyes,
all the A-listers are paying visits.

259
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,716
- Gives the joint credibility.
- It's where the final seal goes down.

260
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:00,138
Well, it's good enough for me. Let's
pack up Nurse Betty and hit the road.

261
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,473
Hey, maybe, uh- Uh-

262
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,227
- What?
- Maybe we can find another demon.

263
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,730
Sam. No.

264
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,608
That blubbery, don't-hurt-me crap,
it's just an act.

265
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,944
- She's playing you.
- I'm not so sure.

266
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,530
There's still a hell bitch snoozing
in there.

267
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,865
I mean, come on.

268
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,951
It's not like you haven't
done this before, right?

269
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,795
No. Please, don't.

270
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,299
Just listen to me, okay?
My name is Cindy McCellen.

271
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,759
I'm a nurse in the NICU
over Enfield Memorial.

272
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,596
I have a husband, Matthew.
We've been married six years.

273
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,847
He's gonna be worried.

274
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,600
I don't know you,
I'm not gonna tell anybody anything.

275
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,143
Just, please let me go.

276
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,647
No! No! No!

277
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,234
Please. No. Ple-

278
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,987
No! No!

279
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,373
You asked to see me?

280
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,420
Ahem, yeah.
Listen, I, uh, need something.

281
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,755
Anything you wish.

282
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,549
- I need you to take me to see Sam.
- Why?

283
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,053
- Something I gotta talk to him about.
- What's that?

284
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,765
The BM I took this morning,
what's it to you? Just make it snappy.

285
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,476
I don't think that's wise.

286
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,771
Well, I didn't ask you for your opinion.

287
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,774
Have you forgotten what happened
the last time you met?

288
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,776
No.

289
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,069
That's the whole point.

290
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,739
I'm gonna do whatever
you mooks want, okay?

291
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,910
I just need to tie up this one thing.
Five minutes. That's all I need.

292
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,662
No.

293
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,999
What do you mean "no"?

294
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,212
- You saying that I'm trapped here?
- You can go wherever you want.

295
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,048
- Super. I wanna go see Sam.
- Except there.

296
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,259
- I wanna take a walk.
- I'll go with you.

297
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,427
- Alone.
- No.

298
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,389
You know what? Screw this noise.
I'm out of here.

299
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,767
Through what door?

300
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,534
Damn it.

301
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,417
What are you, a 12-year-old girl?
Play it.

302
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,710
Mind your own business.

303
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,545
Let me out!

304
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,505
Let me out!

305
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,300
God, I wish she would just shut up.

306
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,801
Well, that can be arranged.

307
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,845
Let me out!

308
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:50,016
I don't get it. All the demons you cut,
what do you think happens to the host?

309
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,269
- How is this different?
- That supposed to make me feel better?

310
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,647
I know you're having a tough time here.
But we're on the final lap.

311
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,983
Now is not the time
to grow a persqueeter.

312
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,444
Would you drop the frigging attitude?

313
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,864
I'm about to bleed and drink
an innocent woman while she watches.

314
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,867
And save the world as a result.

315
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,622
I know, I just-

316
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm starting to think...

317
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,502
- ... maybe Dean was right.
- About what?

318
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,046
About everything.

319
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,847
We're gonna see this through,
right, Sam?

320
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,810
Sam?

321
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,772
Let me out! Let me out!

322
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,873
Son of a bitch.

323
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,085
Quit hurling feces like a howler monkey,
would you?

324
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,629
- It's unbecoming.
- Let me out of here.

325
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,507
I told you, too dangerous out there.
Demons on the prowl.

326
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,760
I been getting my ass kicked all year,
now you're sweating my safety?

327
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,804
You're lying.

328
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,180
I wanna see my brother.

329
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,183
That's ill advised.

330
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,770
You know, I am so sick of your crap
riddles and your smug fat face.

331
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,605
What the hell is going on, huh?

332
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,650
Why can't I see Sam?
And how am I gonna ice Lilith?

333
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,405
You're not...

334
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,864
...going to ice Lilith.

335
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:34,120
- What?
- Lilith's going to break the final seal.

336
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,748
Fait accompli, at this point.
Train's left the station.

337
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,462
But, me and Sam, we can stop-

338
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:52,805
- You don't wanna stop it, do you?
- Nope. Never did.

339
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,516
The end is nigh,
the Apocalypse is coming, kiddo...

340
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,018
...to a theater near you.

341
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,022
What was all that crap
about saving seals?

342
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,402
Grunts on the ground,
we couldn't tell them the whole truth...

343
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,904
...we'd have a full-scale rebellion
on our hands.

344
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,825
I mean, think about it. Would we really
let 65 seals get broken...

345
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,078
...unless senior management
wanted it that way?

346
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,582
- But why?
- Why not?

347
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,375
The Apocalypse.

348
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,711
Poor name, bad marketing,
it puts people off.

349
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,213
When all it is, is Ali-Foreman.

350
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,384
On a slightly larger scale.
And we like our chances.

351
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,305
When our side wins, and we will...

352
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,766
...it's paradise on Earth.
What's not to like about that?

353
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:45,191
And what happens to all the people
during your little pissing contest?

354
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,236
Well, can't make an omelet
without cracking a few eggs.

355
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:53,782
In this case, truckloads of eggs,
but you get the picture.

356
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,577
Look...

357
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,080
...it happens.

358
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:05,002
This isn't the first planetary enema
we've delivered.

359
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,050
Oh, no, probably shouldn't try to bash
my skull in with that thing.

360
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,594
Wouldn't end up too pleasant for you.

361
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,724
What about Sam?

362
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,060
He won't go quietly. He'll stop Lilith.

363
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,355
Sam...

364
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,315
...has a part to play.

365
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,651
A very important part.

366
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,654
He may need a little nudging
in the right direction...

367
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,489
...but I'll make sure he plays it.

368
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,700
What does that mean?

369
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,870
- What are you gonna do to him?
- Sam, Sam, Sam.

370
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,957
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.
Forget about him, would you?

371
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,877
You have larger concerns.

372
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,881
Why do you think I'm confiding in you?
You're still vital, Dean.

373
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,217
We weren't lying about your destiny.

374
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,679
Just omitted a few pertinent details.

375
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,765
But nothing's changed.
You are chosen.

376
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,058
You will stop it.

377
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,979
Just not Lilith
or the Apocalypse, that's all.

378
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,107
Which means?

379
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,194
Lucifer.

380
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,781
You're going to stop Lucifer.

381
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,327
You're our own little Russell Crowe,
complete with surly attitude.

382
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,998
And when it's over...

383
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,583
...and when you've won...

384
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,378
...your rewards will be unimaginable.

385
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,047
Peace. Happiness.

386
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,966
Two virgins and 70 sluts.

387
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,637
Trust me, one day
we'll look back on this and laugh.

388
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,806
Tell me something.

389
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,603
Where's God in all this?

390
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,022
God?

391
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,317
God has left the building.

392
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,898
Howdy.

393
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:38,072
Lady, uh, this is private property.
You're not supposed to be here.

394
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,283
But I'm here for Mass.
And so are you.

395
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,756
You can't reach him, Dean.

396
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,633
You're outside your coverage zone.

397
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,595
What are you gonna do to Sam?

398
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,807
Nothing.

399
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,643
He's gonna do it to himself.

400
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,481
What's that supposed to mean?

401
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,860
Oh, right, right.

402
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,905
Gotta toe the company line.

403
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,701
Why are you here, Cass?

404
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,704
We've been through much together,
you and I.

405
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,124
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry
it ended like this.

406
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,794
Sorry?

407
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,264
It's Armageddon, Cass.
You need a bigger word than sorry.

408
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,225
Try to understand.
This is long foretold.

409
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,936
- This is your-
- Destiny?

410
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,106
Don't give me that holy crap.

411
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,443
Destiny, God's plan...

412
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,821
...it's a bunch of lies,
you poor, stupid son of a bitch.

413
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,199
It's just a way for your bosses
to keep me, and keep you, in line.

414
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,703
You know what's real?

415
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,996
People.

416
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,498
Families. That's real.

417
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,252
- And you're gonna watch them all burn?
- What is so worth saving?

418
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,963
I see nothing but pain here.

419
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,715
I see inside you.

420
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,677
I see your guilt, your anger, confusion.

421
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,013
In paradise, all is forgiven.

422
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,557
You'll be at peace.

423
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,933
Even with Sam.

424
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,820
You can take your peace...

425
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,864
...and shove it up your lily-white ass.

426
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,869
Because I'll take the pain and the guilt,
I'll even take Sam as is.

427
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,331
It's a lot better than being some
Stepford bitch in paradise.

428
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,916
This is simple, Cass.

429
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,044
No more crap
about being a good soldier.

430
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,047
There is a right and there is a wrong here
and you know it!

431
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,133
Look at me. You know it!

432
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,470
Now, you were gonna help me once,
weren't you?

433
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,890
You were gonna warn me,
before they dragged you to Bible camp.

434
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,977
Help me now, please.

435
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,065
- What would you have me do?
- Get me to Sam. We can stop this...

436
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,819
- ... before it's too late.
- I do that, we will all be hunted.

437
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,111
We'll all be killed.

438
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,283
If there is anything worth dying for...

439
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,035
...this is it.

440
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,878
You spineless...

441
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,048
...soulless son of a bitch.

442
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,342
What do you care about dying?

443
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,262
You're already dead. We're done.

444
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,598
- Dean.
- We're done.

445
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,787
Sam. It's time.
Are we doing this or not?

446
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,457
- Give me a minute to think.
- Sam.

447
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,459
Give me a damn minute, Ruby!

448
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,213
Better think fast.

449
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,059
First unread message.

450
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,021
Listen to me, you bloodsucking freak.

451
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,190
Dad always said I'd either
have to save you or kill you.

452
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,401
Well, I'm giving you fair warning.

453
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,486
I'm done trying to save you.

454
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,406
You're a monster, Sam. A vampire.

455
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,827
You're not you anymore,
and there's no going back.

456
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,932
Do it.

457
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,559
Thank God.

458
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,276
Help!

459
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,323
Castiel!

460
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,410
Would you mind explaining
just what the hell you're doing?

461
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,251
He won't be gone long.

462
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,545
We have to find Sam now.

463
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,507
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but I know who does.

464
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,967
We have to stop him, Dean.

465
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,343
From killing Lilith.

466
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,055
- But Lilith's gonna break the final seal.
- Lilith is the final seal.

467
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,100
She dies, the end begins.

468
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,568
Oh, yeah? Really?
At the same time? Really? Wow.

469
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:54,031
- That sounds moist.
Well, it can be.

470
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,117
- Uh, what are your rates?
- We can get you one girl...

471
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,619
...one hour, 1000.

472
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,581
Okay. Then I'll take 20 girls...

473
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,624
...for the whole night.

474
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,085
I'm not sure you can afford that.

475
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:11,048
Lady, sometimes you gotta live
like there's no tomorrow.

476
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,301
- Wait. This isn't supposed to happen.
- Sir?

477
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,970
No, lady,
this is definitely supposed to happen.

478
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,264
But I just gotta call you back.

479
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,933
All right.

480
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,155
Don't be afraid.

481
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,408
We're going to save the world.

482
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,266
- St. Mary's? What is that, a convent?
Yeah.

483
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,520
You guys aren't supposed to be there.
You're not in this story.

484
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:10,315
Yeah, well,
we're making it up as we go.

485
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,195
What? Oh, man. Not again.

486
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,782
It's the Archangel.

487
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,034
I'll hold him off, I'll hold them all off.

488
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,369
Just stop Sam!

489
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,595
I've been waiting for this...

490
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,431
...for a very long time.

491
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,350
Then give me your best shot.

492
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,034
Sam!

493
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,456
Sam.

494
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,126
Sammy.

495
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,796
Sam.

496
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,964
Dean?

497
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:06,640
What are you waiting for?
Now! Do it now, damn it!

498
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,892
Sam!

499
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,354
Sam, now!

500
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,574
You turned yourself into a freak.

501
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,410
Ha, ha. A monster.

502
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,497
And now you're not gonna bite?

503
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,626
Ha, ha. I'm sorry,
but that is honestly adorable.

504
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,098
What the hell?

505
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,394
I can't believe it.

506
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,315
Ruby, what's going on?

507
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,066
You did it.

508
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:44,237
I mean, it was a little touch-and-go
there for a while, but you did it.

509
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,948
What? What? What did I do?

510
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,034
You opened the door.

511
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,787
And now he's free at last.

512
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,248
- He's free at last.
- No, no, no.

513
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,084
He- Lilith, I stopped her. I killed her.

514
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:01,838
And it is written, that the first demon
shall be the last seal.

515
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,800
And you bust her open.

516
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,345
Now guess who's coming to dinner?

517
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,639
Oh, my God.

518
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,099
Guess again.

519
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,357
You don't even know
how hard this was.

520
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,777
All the demons out for my head.
No one knew.

521
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,613
I was the best
of those sons of bitches.

522
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,531
The most loyal.

523
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,617
Not even Alastair knew.

524
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,951
Only Lilith.

525
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,789
Yeah, I'm sure you're a little angry
right now, but I mean, come on, Sam.

526
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,667
Even you have to admit I'm-
I'm awesome.

527
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,713
You bitch. You lying bitch.

528
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,809
Don't hurt yourself, Sammy.
It's useless.

529
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,811
You shot your payload on the boss.

530
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,149
The blood...

531
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,026
...you poisoned me.

532
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,529
No.

533
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:12,659
It wasn't the blood.
It was you and your choices.

534
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:17,664
I just gave you the options,
and you chose the right path every time.

535
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,167
You didn't need the feather to fly.

536
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,378
You had it in you the whole time,
Dumbo.

537
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,258
I know it's hard to see it now...

538
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,385
...but this is a miracle.

539
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,679
So long coming.

540
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:38,685
Everything Azazel did, and Lilith did,
just to get you here.

541
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,896
And you were the only one
who could do it.

542
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,857
Why?

543
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,736
- Why me?
- Because.

544
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,532
Because it had to be you, Sammy.

545
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,535
It always had to be you.

546
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,079
You saved us.

547
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,875
You set him free
and he's gonna be grateful.

548
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,879
He's gonna repay you in ways
that you can't even imagine.

549
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,303
- You're too late.
- I don't care.

550
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,203
I'm sorry.

551
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,926
- Sammy, let's go.
- Dean...

552
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,097
...he's coming.
