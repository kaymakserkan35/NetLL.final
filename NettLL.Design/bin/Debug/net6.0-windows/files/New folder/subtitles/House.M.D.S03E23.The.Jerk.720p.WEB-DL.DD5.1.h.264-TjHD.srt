I'm having a moment.

57
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,510
This could be Foreman's last time
mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.

58
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,710
Which could create excess adrenaline,
causes the head pain and rage.

But not the personality disorder.

60
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,540
There is no personality disorder.

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,940
He's a teenager.

62
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,950
Being a teenager excuses the odd
inappropriate comment.

63
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,790
This kid say anything appropriate?

64
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,420
He's having cluster headaches.

65
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,430
Probably been having them for years.
Question is, what's causing them?

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,490
If it were just a cluster headache,
he'd have swelling around the eyes.

67
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,730
ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain.

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,290
Useless for this pain,
but it could've knocked down the swelling.

69
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,300
Best bet is a vascular problem.

70
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,970
Normal treatment for cluster headaches
is steroids, which the ER also gave him.

71
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,510
He's still in pain, which means...

72
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,770
Normal treatment is called
"normal treatment"

73
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,870
because sometimes
you have to use abnormal treatment.

74
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,540
Start him on blood thinners,

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,050
and give his noggin
transcranial magnetic stimulation.

76
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,790

The magnetic pulses activate nerve cells,
which will hopefully squelch the head pain.

about the other pain?

I'm pretty sure I get it.

111
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,960
I thought I was a bad mother.

112
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,090
And I hated myself

113
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,100
because I hated him.

for the personality disorder.

126
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,200
But no fat in the ventricles.
It's cluster headaches.

Abnormal treatment didn't work.

But treatments don't always work.
Symptoms never lie.

130
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,140
The only approved treatment left
for cluster headaches is brain surgery,

131
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,120

It was one of the other petty,

Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.

If you want me to stay,
tell me you want me to stay.

148
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,130
Would it matter?

149
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,300
No, but it'd be the adult way to handle it.

150
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,470
If the adult way doesn't work,
why bother with it?

151
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,040
I've been totally professional!

152
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,180
Gave two weeks' notice,
continued to work cases,

153
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,310
scheduled my interviews on my own time.

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,690
You have no right to screw with my future.

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,860
You're gonna be all whiny during
the differential diagnoses, aren't you?

156
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,500
It wasn't me.

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,900
I only sabotage people I consider worth it.

158
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,070
You are one evil, cunning woman.

159
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,440
It's a massive turn-on.

160
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,350
You girls can gossip later.

161
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,190
What are you talking about?

162
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,250
You called New York Mercy
to have Foreman's job interview killed.

163
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,960
When I said, "You girls can gossip later,"
I was throwing you out, but in a polite way.

164
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,040
Well, I take it
you're off your anti-depressants.

165
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,840
You're deflecting.
Only I'm allowed to do that.

166
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,430
Does Foreman actually think I did that?

167
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,170
No. Just me.

168
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,470
But I know something he doesn't:
I didn't do it.

169
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,670
Why would I do it?

170
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,150
Do you want him to leave?
No.

171
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,840
Are you planning on doing something?

172
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,480
I'm waiting for board approval.

173
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,540
But if he takes the job,
there's nothing to be done.

174
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,110
You had to stop him.

175
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,710
It wasn't me.

176
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,340
What are you doing?

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,270
Looking for a tell.
Rapid eye blink, twitch of the lips.

178
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,240
Send in Nurse Unger
when you pass her on your way out.

179
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,980
Oh, almost forgot.

180
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,040
I need to give a 16-year-old
magic mushrooms

181
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,310
to treat a cluster headache.

182
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,610
Is that cool?

183
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,150
Yeah, no problem.

184
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,960
I was being sarcastic.

185
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
It wouldn't look that way
in the court transcript.

186
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,890
Mushrooms have psilocybins
that work on cluster headaches.

187
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,030
It's either that or cutting into his brain
and going on a fishing expedition.

188
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,870
I assume you've considered
he could have a psychogenic experience,

189
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,740
possibly suffer a fit of severe paranoia.

190
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,740
Well, I have now.

191
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,650
Yeah, it's definitely better
that the Dean of Medicine prescribes it

192
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,840
instead of an unhinged doctor
with a history of drug use.

193
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,950
Takes the stink off if the patient decides
to put on a cape and fly off the roof.

194
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,080
Low dose. No more than 10 milligrams,
tightly controlled setting.

195
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,860
And make sure the mother signs off on it.

196
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,400
Party on, Garth.

197
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,660
And don't stand in Foreman's way.
It's just wrong.

198
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,500
New research shows that a chemical
component in the mushrooms can...

199
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,740
Yeah, lots of technical medical stuff.
So when do I get them?

200
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,810
I went to college. I know about mushrooms.

201
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,710
Friend of a friend shot himself in the foot.

202
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,250
They're not giving me a gun, Enid!

203
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,850
Sign the consent form.

204
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,720
We'll be monitoring him,
but cardiac arrest is possible.

205
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,020
Big "E,"

206
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,360
small "N"...

207
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,800
And if the mushrooms don't work?

208
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,630
The next step would be
a type of brain surgery.

209
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,690
Oh, God.

210
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,260
Pain's getting worse!

211
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,930
Need shrooms now!

212
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,620
Oh, yeah.

213
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,560
Nate, how's the pain?

214
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,740
Hey, hey! It's Skippy, the bush kangaroo!

215
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,870
<i>Your head, Nate.</i>
<i>We need to know how the pain is.</i>

216
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,970
What I got here

217
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,980
is the opposite of pain.

218
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,680
That means you're suffering from
cluster headaches, which means hopefully...

219
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,850
Man, you're hot.

220
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,250
She's making me horny.

221
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,350
<i>Deal with it.</i>

222
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,330
Hey, hey, hey, you can't get me stoned,
then not close the deal.

223
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,460
<i>Shut up.</i>
<i>Take it easy.</i>

224
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,030
You'll regret saying no!

225
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,900
Check it out.

226
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,540
Oh, for God's sake.

227
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,270
Hold it.

228
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,540
What are you doing?

229
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,570
He has undersized testes.

230
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,180
His other secondary sexual characteristics
are normal.

231
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,190
If you want to curry favor with me,
avoid discussions of other men's testicles.

232
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,120
Thanks.

233
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,630
Focus on phrases like,

234
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,060
"You were right
about the cluster headaches."

235
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,720
You're wrong about what caused them.

236
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,130
Vascular problem in a major artery
wouldn't cause hypogonadism.

237
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,660
Okay, what causes rage, headaches,
personality disorder and hypogonadism?

238
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,300
Where's Foreman?

239
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,600
He's mad at me.

240
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,700
Why?
No reason.

241
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,110
Yeah. That makes sense.

242
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,010
The male genitals are controlled
by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

243
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,950
We're not talking about Foreman anymore.

244
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,320
Kid's being pummeled at school.

245
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,860
A couple blows to the head
can cause hypothalamic lesions.

246
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,260
We ever going to talk about what happens
when Foreman's gone?

247
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,990
If this were an employee-owned airline
in Scandinavia, yes.

248
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,120
It's not lesions.
His temperature would be all over the map.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Symptoms don't lie.

250
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,500
He's gone in less than a week,
and you haven't even read a résumé.

251
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,730
Doesn't even need to.
The two of us can handle it.

252
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,370
Craniopharyngioma fits the symptoms.

253
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,070
Biopsy the brat's pituitary.

254
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,270
And let the record show
I was right about the cluster headaches.

255
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,380
Forget it!

256
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,710
It's a straightforward procedure.

257
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,880
We thread an endoscopic tube
up through the nostril...

258
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,620
And cut something out of my brain? No way.

259
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,550
If it's a tumor, it could kill you.

260
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,220
Just give me more shrooms, okay?
I'll be fine.

261
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,560
You only need my consent, right?

262
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,360
Yeah, but it'll be a lot easier if...

263
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,630
Do whatever you have to do.

264
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,370
You don't touch me, all right?
You can touch me, just not my brain.

265
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,230
Nate, you got to do this.
I can't take it anymore...

266
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,900
My God, Mom! Save me
the melodramatic hand-wringing, okay?

267
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,410
Loosen up! Get yourself coited.

268
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,210
I'm going to give him a sedative.

269
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,750
You're decent-looking, Dr. Skippy.

270
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,340
Why don't you take her for a ride?

271
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,480
Nate?

272
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,050
<i>Are you in pain?</i>

273
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,360
Nate?

274
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,330
His heart rate's normal. Respiration's even.

275
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,370
What's happening?
What's the matter with him?

276
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,700
He's jaundiced. His liver's shutting down.

277
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,450
CHASE: We've started him
on sodium polystyrene sulfonate.

278
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,280
His liver's operating at about 20%

279
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,910
and deteriorating fast.

280
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,280
Which means he'll be dead long before
Foreman turns in his parking pass.

281
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,660
So what causes personality disorder,
head pain, blah, blah, blah,

282
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
and liver failure?

283
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,200
Liver failure can cause
hypogonadism, head pain.

284
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,070
Altered mental status
leads to the personality disorder and rage.

285
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,160
All we need to do is figure out
what caused the liver failure.

286
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,440
Yes. Also, we need to figure out
how symptoms yesterday

287
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,380
can be caused by liver failure today.

288
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,510
If his liver's failing now,
it wasn't great yesterday.

289
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,610
If it wasn't operating at capacity,
it could have caused...

290
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,670
(EXCLAIMING)

291
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,650
Don't sneak up on a person like that!

292
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,910
I'm listening.

293
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,620
Well, listening doesn't help me.

294
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,320
Okay. Let's go with the liver
and a time-machine theory.

295
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,290
Foreman, what causes liver problems?

296
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,660
Wilson's Disease.

297
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,430
No. Ceruloplasmin is normal.

298
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,990
No enlargement and no palpable mass,
so no cancer.

299
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,510
Could be a narrowing of the bile ducts.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.

300
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,740
Most liver damage begins
with what we put in our bodies. Foreman?

301
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,710
Angry teen... Alcohol.

302
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,540
No. Blood tests were negative.

303
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,740
No signs of drug use or
acetaminophen poisoning in his tox screen.

304
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,510
Maybe the water was contaminated.

305
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,420
His mother would also be sick.

306
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,680
Cuddy?

307
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,020
Sounded like someone would back.

308
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,420
Go.

309
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,060
We'll try and muddle through
without your blank stare to guide us.

310
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,700
So if it's not the bad things he's putting in,
what about the good things?

311
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,330
He was raised a vegetarian.

312
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,630
"Was raised."

313
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,810
Means he's all grown up,
or he's not a vegetarian anymore.

314
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,780
He started eating red meat
a few months ago.

315
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,440
Unless he's been buying cuts of mad cow,

316
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,240
his body would have no problem
metabolizing it.

317
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,650
What if he had an OTC deficiency?

318
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,920
Body can't metabolize nitrogen,
damages the liver.

319
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,980
Run a hamburger test.

320
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,050
It's exactly what it sounds like.

321
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,100
Stuff him full of meat,
wait for his ammonia levels to spike.

322
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,110
I'll double your salary.

323
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,880
Chase and Cameron would mutiny
if they found out.

324
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,210
Chase and Cameron wouldn't be heading up
their own diagnostic group.

325
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,180
You'd work in parallel with House.
It'll be your practice.

326
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,250
Separate staff, separate cases,
complete autonomy.

327
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,590
I've only been doing this for three years.

328
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,090
Three years under House.

329
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,250
No better training.

330
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,920
And when that case comes along
that I can't figure out,

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,260
you know who I'd have to go to.

332
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,260
Or you can just let that patient die.
That's completely up to you.

333
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,000
No.

334
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,340
Why?

335
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,880
He's evil.

336
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,840
He didn't sabotage your interview.

337
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,910
How do you know?

338
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,250
Because I did.

339
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,320
I didn't!

340
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,320
You believed me.
Means you're not sure House did it.

341
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,260
Well, somebody did it.

342
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,360
Somebody here did it.

343
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,630
I can't work here.

344
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,670
(DOOR OPENS)

345
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,950
This isn't a medical procedure.

346
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,160
This is just about Doogie
making me eat garbage.

347
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,060
We need to see
how your liver processes the proteins.

348
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,790
Then get me a steak. Some roast beef.

something from home?

there's no chemicals or preservatives

Trust me.
It'll be a lot less messy if you do it yourself.

You killed Foreman's job interview.

366
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,620
Why would I...
Somebody did.

367
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,680
Wasn't me, and it wasn't House,

368
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,090
which means it has to be somebody
who thought he was protecting House,

369
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,100
which means it has to be somebody
who actually likes House,

370
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,600
which means it's either you

371
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,570
or the weird night janitor
who wears his pants backwards.

I want Foreman to leave.

373

he needs someone who stands up to him.

A few tummy aches

What?
You're paranoid.

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,030
You made that call.

384
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,840
And because of that call,

you basically guaranteed
Foreman's out of here.

I thought it'd be fun
to work on my boat with him.

And you went shirtless,
because skin cancer looks cool.

When Daddy works on his boat,

393
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,450
does he have a cooler
with lots of brown bottles with long necks?

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,440

on his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?

it wouldn't be his fault either.

No, I mean, I literally don't believe it.

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,320
Cuddy wouldn't fire you
for something like that.

473

You were looking for a reaction.

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,040
You were looking for me to feel bad for you,

But how am I going to save you?

Unless you think I'm the one
who really did it.

480
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,290
Cuddy's logic was,

481
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,920
Foreman's valuable to House,
I care about House,

482
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,360
ergo, I would do anything to save him.

483
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,590
And your logic was, I care about House
as much as you do, ergo...

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,700
It wasn't me.

Foreman thought it was House.
House thought it was Cuddy.

00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,040
Cuddy thought it was Wilson.
Wilson thought it was me.

498
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,110
And you think it was me?

499
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,280

Then why would I do...

00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,620
I think you sabotaged Foreman
just to sabotage Foreman.

504
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,470
So everyone's a suspect
because everyone wants to help House,

except for me, I'm a suspect
because I'm a petty, vindictive jerk?

I would do something like that?

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,700
It was someone.

He's got a partial HPRT enzyme deficiency.

517
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,550
Means he could have
Kelley-Seegmiller Syndrome.

518
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,910
But it's a partial deficiency,
so it may not be Kelley-Seegmiller.

Yes, those are the two options. It is,

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,880
or it isn't.

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,660
If he had Kelley-Seegmiller,
he wouldn't just be aggressive.

523
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,420
He'd be self-mutilating.
Chewing his lips, banging his head.

524
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,120
Lovely disease.

525
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,570
Degenerative, fatal, incurable.

526
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,200
I wonder if that's why Cameron's
on the "not" side?

527
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,760
That and the fact that symptoms don't lie.

528
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,570
Kelley-Seegmiller carriers
self-mutilate when they're stressed.

529
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,410
He's in ICU with a failing liver
and no kidneys.

530
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,310
Yeah, his life is sweet.

531
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,810
His vegetarian diet could have limited
the purines in his system,

532
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
slowing the disease's progress.

533
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,510
So let's speed it up.

534
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,610
Why?

535
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,690
So you two kids will stop fighting.

536
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,230
Also, I don't feel like waiting
for respiratory failure.

537
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,420
Chase, find some way
for the mother to get lost for a while.

538
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,990
I'm going to stress this kid
till he bites off a finger.

539
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,080
You move me to geriatrics?

540
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,710
Who are you?

541
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,040
Dr. McCaney.

542
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,170
The man who's going to kick your ass
all over this chess board.

543
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,310
Well, I'm too weak to...

544
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,880
To bite yourself. Yeah.

545
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,790
You need some liquid energy.

546
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,450
Now if you consent,
I'm gonna give you this shot of adrenaline.

Aside from being indicative
of pituitary issues

550
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,500
and certain kinds of genetic disorders,
small testicles also indicate

551
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,440
that you're a big chicken.

552
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,340
Please don't make me do the sound effect.

553
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,800
You're not going to goad me into playing.

554
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,610
Didn't think I'd have to.

555
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,950
Thought you'd just jump at the chance
of humiliating someone.

556
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,320
Age before cripple. I'm white.

557
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,830
It is on.

558
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,040
Bird's Opening. Passive approach.
Sign of a coward.

559
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,420
Sicilian Defense. Sign of an idiot.

560
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,610
Arrogance has to be earned.

561
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,950
Tell me what you've done to earn yours.

562
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,990
I can walk.

563
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,990
I don't bleed out of my penis.

You know, it's a real thin line
between tortured genius

566
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,050
and awkward kid who can't get girls
because he's creepy.

567
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,530
Why are you doing this?

568
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,490
To stress you out.

569

Yeah, but why?

571
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,660
Well, I'd tell you,

572
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,370
but I figure it's more stressful
if you don't know why.

573
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,140
Yeah, well, I'm not feeling too stressed.

574
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,000
You know that no one likes you, right?

575
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,570
Yeah. Well, anybody like you?

576
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,950

00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,870
Crap.

594
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,700
He's having a seizure.

595
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,770
Four milligrams I.V. Lorazepam.

596
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,870
Right away.

597
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,600
I hate this kid.

598
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,240
I like this kid.

599
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,710
Did you get the job?

600
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,470
They're going to let me know.

601
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,480
Kelley-Seegmiller didn't cause this seizure.

602
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,570
So we've got one more symptom,
one less diagnosis.

603
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,080
I assume they're going to call for references.

604
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,210
Did you give them my name?

605
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,310
No.

606
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,190
Amyloidosis can cause seizures,

607
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,280
and the protein buildup
could cause organ failure.

608
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,950
Wouldn't alter his personality.

609
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,720
Whose name did you give?

610
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,920
My last boss.

611
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,990
Ouch.

612
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,960
That can't look good.

613
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,400
I hate this kid.

614
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,230
What if we're not dealing
with one condition?

615
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,140
What if it's multiple conditions?

616
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,730
It's got to be one. It's always one.

617
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,240
But nothing explains
this constellation of symptoms.

618
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,640
We've got to be missing something.

619
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,580
Maybe the kid lied about some medication.
Maybe he's hiding something...

620
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,880
Why would he be hiding something?

621
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,250
Well, I don't know, because he's evil?

622
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,710
What if he is?

623
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,350
What if the symptoms lied?

624
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,260
There.

625
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,430
Now all we're looking at is a simple evil jerk
with amyloidosis.

626
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,730
You're not being objective.

627
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,240
Amyloidosis was your idea.

628
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,860
You were right. It doesn't fit the symptoms.

629
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,840
Yeah, it does. Look.

630
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,970
You crossed it off
because you want to hate the kid,

631
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,480
and you can't hate him if he's a victim...

632
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,640
You want him to be a victim because
you want to believe that people are good.

633
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,950
And if they're not,
it's got to be a chemical problem.

634
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,040
Except they're not, and it's not.

635
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,550
Flush him with immunosuppressants.

636
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,530
Get a biopsy to confirm,
and find him a marrow donor.

637
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,090
What'll happen to him?

638
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,070
Substances called amyloid proteins

639
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,940
build up in the body's organs,
shutting them down.

640
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,010
It's a fairly rare disease,
and I'm afraid it can be fatal.

641
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,880
So, do you operate or something
to take them out?

642
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,360
He needs a bone marrow transplant.

643
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,620
Dr. Cameron is searching the donor bank.

644
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,860
We should test you as well.

645
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,200
When you first told me he was sick, I was

646
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,000
happy.

647
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,870
Relieved.

648
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,950
Now...

649
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:06,020
Nate, I'm going to take
a small piece of nerve from your ankle.

650
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,430
Let me know if you feel any pain.

651
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,890
I'm burning up.

652
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,260
Why can't you just knock me out
like you did last time?

653
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,600
Wish I could.

654
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,930
But your body has to be clear
so it's ready for a marrow transplant.

655
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,530
Hey, Dr. X.

656
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,940
I know you've busted ass trying to save me.

657
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,080
It's all right.

658
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,050
I wasn't going to thank you.

659
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,440
I was going to tell you

660
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,550
you really suck at this.

661
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,510
We're doing our best.

662
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,020
That's sort of my point.

663
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,390
Your best really sucks.

664
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,830
Nerve biopsy was clean.
No evidence of amyloidosis.

665
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,910
It was your idea. Don't give up on it so fast.

666
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,270
He's running a fever.

667
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,010
If it's two conditions,
one of them's got to be an infection.

668
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,640
We should start him on antibiotics,
see what clears up, what doesn't.

669
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,210
Is he having trouble breathing?

670
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,150
Yeah, he has mucus in his chest
from an infection.

671
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,280
Could also be from an amyloid buildup.

672
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,690
Keep him on immunosuppressants
and biopsy somewhere else.

673
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,020
His sinuses.

674
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,860
Look, you got two choices:

675
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,900
Engage me in a futile argument
then do what I asked,

676
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,450
or just do what I asked.

677
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,860
You're not ready.

678
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,400
There was a third choice.

679
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,370
"Don't do what I asked."

680
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,180
You could have defied me,
stuck the kid on antibiotics,

681
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,650
but you didn't.

682
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,210
Because you still trust my judgment
more than your own.

683
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,580
You sabotaged Foreman's job interview,
didn't you?

684
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,470
Foreman's already been over this.

685
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,040
It wasn't me.

686
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,320
Everybody's chasing ghosts over this,

687
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,950
which means either nobody did it

688
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,550
or somebody wants everybody
chasing ghosts.

689
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,790
Now, who does that sound like?

690
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,300
And why would I do that?

691
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
Because as long as Foreman
thought you were guilty,

692
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,800
he was going to be useless around here.

693
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,180
You know, sometimes I forget
why I hired you.

694
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,940
You cost him a good opportunity
and gained nothing.

695
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,210
I cost him a crappy opportunity.

696
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,650
New York Mercy is where you go
to treat boils and cysts and build a 401-K.

697
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,160
If you want him to stay, tell him.

698
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,850
I don't, and there'd be no point.

699
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,150
You do.

700
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,390
And the point would be
to make him feel like he's wanted.

701
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,790
He doesn't need that.

702
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,230
All right, then, it'd make him feel
like maybe you weren't evil.

703
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,230
He needs that.

704
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,510
Talk to Foreman.

705
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,880
We dumped one symptom,

706
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,480
but forgot to add one.

707
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,670
Revenge time, Nate.

708
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,700
Are you...
Yes, I am.

709
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,430
Black or white?

710
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,300
Just limp away.

711
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,240
He doesn't want to play. Leave him alone.

712
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,640
Pick one, or this comes out.

713
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,110
And for all you know,
this is really important.

714
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,880
(GROANS)

715
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,950
Stop it!

716
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,290
That hurts, right?

717
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,430
Which is odd,
because I'm really enjoying this.

718
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,630
You hold the pieces that way
because you can't bend your thumb,

719
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,330
because your bones
have formed abnormally,

720
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,540
thanks to all the crap that's been
pushing its way in between them.

721
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,100
Actually, this stuff isn't important at all.

722
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,470
Your doctors said
he needs immunosuppressants.

723
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,440
They're idiots. It's not amyloidosis.

724
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,950
It's iron.

725
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,780
He's got hemochromatosis.

726
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,980
The body absorbs iron from food
but can't process it, can't get rid of it.

727
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,820
<i>Idle iron is the devil's playground.</i>

728
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,920
<i>Builds up in the organs and joints,</i>
<i>whacking them in the process.</i>

729
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,550
Causes all the symptoms.

730
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,860
Including something that wasn't a symptom.

731
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,160
Those body aches?
They were not from the fighting.

732
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,030
His personality issues?

733
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,200
Sorry.

734
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,110
The iron's innocent on that count.

735
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,130
Your kid's a jerk.

736
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,510
Yeah, it's probably your fault.

737
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,140
Although, if you'd stayed off the meat
like your mom said,

738
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,380
you'd have half as much iron
and be twice less

739
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,510
almost dead.

(GROANS)

741
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,120
Oh, nurse!

742
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,850
(ALARM BEEPING)

743
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,300
This patient is bleeding, for some reason.

744
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,420
Is he going to be okay?

745
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,870
He'll need dialysis,

746
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,460
gonna have to get his blood drained
every few months for the rest of his life.

747
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,010
My condolences.

748
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,430
It's going to be a long and annoying life.

749
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,650
And I wouldn't have taken your bishop.

750
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,240
I'd have moved my queen to D6,
defusing the threat,

751
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,810
then rook to E8, attacking the king's pawn.

752
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,420
I'd have lost the exchange
but won the game.

753
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,830
I know.

754
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,630
I was bluffing.

755
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,030
And that's why

756
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,730
you lost.

757
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,440
Jerk.

758
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,000
You just here to watch
or you got something to say?

759
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,970
Still running the new biopsy
for amyloidosis?

760
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,980
Yeah. Still nothing.

761
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,190
Run the test again. Recheck your results.

762
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,020
Looks like you're in for an all-nighter.
