1
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,010
Stay on your knees.

2
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,050
He's being held on suspicion of murder.

3
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,930
Murder?

4
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,590
And though a short exchange of weapons
fire occurred just a few minutes ago,

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,300
Police and S.W.A.T.Teamsmaintain position as we
enter the third hour of this intense stand-Off.

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,650
Authorities estimate as many as 10
hostages are being held inside the bank.

7
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,540
No word as yet on the
identity of the suspects

8
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,880
Something's happening.

9
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,790
I think they're opening a door.

10
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,030
Roger, you getting this?

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,680
Over there.

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,510
Turn the camera over there.

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,530
No, no, no, no, no!

14
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,440
Don't even think about it!

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,670
Get the hell back!

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,540
So, what's it like -Being an fbi guy?

17
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,570
Well...

18
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,100
It's dangerous.

19
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,450
You know.

20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,950
And the secrets we got to
keep -Oh, countless secrets.

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,200
But mostly it's -It's lonely.

22
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,710
I so know what you mean.

23
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,090
Helena was our head buyer.

25
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,200
She -She was family, you know?

26
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,950
She said it herself every
year at the christmas party.

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,820
She said we were the
only family she had.

28
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,340
So there were never any signs
that she'd do something like this.

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,150
No...

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,210
Still can't believe it, even now.

31
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,830
That night, helena came back to the store after
closing, cleaned out all the display cases and the safe.

32
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,580
Edgar, our night watchman
-He caught her in the act.

33
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,690
He didn't know what to do.

34
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,310
He'd known her for years.

35
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,110
He called me at home.

36
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,860
And that's when she took his gun?

37
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,190
She shot him in the face.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,440
I heard him die over the phone.

39
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,890
Any idea what her
motive could have been?

40
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,980
What motive?

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,220
It makes no sense.

42
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,080
Why steal all those diamonds, all that
jewelry and then, what, just dump it somewhere?

43
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,640
Just hide it and then go home.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,350
She killed herself?

45
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,140
The cop said she dropped the hair
dryer in the bath and fried herself.

46
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,090
They should know, right?

47
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,680
Yeah.

48
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,800
Well, thanks, frannie.

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,040
I think that's all I need.

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,930
Really?

51
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,330
I mean, 'cause i've got more, you
know, if you wanted to interview me...

52
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,850
Sometime in private?

53
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,700
Yeah.

54
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,990
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

55
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,490
You're a true patriot.

56
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,110
You really are.

57
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,840
Why don't you write your
number down there for me?

58
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,370
So you never saw the security-Camera
footage yourself, then.

59
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,490
The police -They took
all the tapes first thing.

60
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,690
Of course they did.

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,480
This is it.

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,980
Freaking cops.

63
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,440
They were just doing their job.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,370
No, they're doing our job, only they
don't know it, so they suck at it.

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,530
Talk to me about this bank.

66
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,310
Milwaukee national trust -It
was hit about a month ago.

67
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,560
Same M.O.As the jewelry store?

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,550
Yep, inside job, longtime employee,
the "never in a million years" type.

69
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,450
Dude robs the bank, then goes home
and supposedly commits suicide.

70
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,160
Resnick was the security guard on duty?

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,080
Yeah, he was actually beaten unconscious
by the teller who heisted the place.

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,730
Oh, god.

73
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,660
Yeah.

74
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,400
Mr.Resnick!

75
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,370
Ronald resnick.

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,190
Fbi, mr.Resnick.

77
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,380
Let me see the badge.

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
I already gave my
statement to the police.

79
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,680
Listen, ronald, just some things about your
statement we wanted to get some clarification on.

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,020
You read it?

81
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,980
Sure did.

82
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,260
Come to listen to what I got to say?

83
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,500
That's why we're here.

84
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,020
Well...

85
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,250
Come on in.

86
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,070
See, none of the cops ever called me back,
not after I told them what was really going on.

87
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,500
They all thought I was crazy.

88
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,580
First off, juan morales never
robbed the milwaukee national trust.

89
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,090
That I guarantee.

90
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,450
See, me and juan were friends.

91
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,110
He used to come back to the bank on
my night shifts, and we'd play cards.

92
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,420
So you let him into the
bank that night, after hours.

93
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,060
The thing I let into the bank...

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,590
Wasn't juan.

95
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,820
I mean, it had his face,
but it wasn't his face.

96
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,790
Every detail was perfect, but too perfect,
you know, like if a doll maker made it,

97
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,330
Like I was talking to a big juan doll.

98
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,840
A juan doll?

99
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,360
Look, this wasn't the
only time this happened.

100
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,100
There was this jewelry store, too, and the
cops and you guys, you just won't see it.

101
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,200
Both crimes were pulled
by the same thing.

102
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,320
And what's that, mr.Resnick?

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,560
Chinese been working on them for
years, and the russians before that

104
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,580
Part man, part machine, like the terminator, but the kind
that can change itself, make itself look like other people.

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,490
Like the one from "t2."

106
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,280
Exactly!

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,880
So not just a robot,
more of a -A man-Droid.

108
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,490
A man-Droid?

109
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,450
What makes you so sure
about this, ronald?

110
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,630
I made copies of all the security tapes.

111
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,570
I knew once the cops got
them, they'd be buried.

112
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,560
Here.

113
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,020
Now watch.

114
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,350
WatcH.

115
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,160
Watch him.

116
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,970
Watch.Watch.

117
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,900
See, look, there it is!

118
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,080
You see?

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,590
He's got the laser eyes.

120
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,620
Cops said it was some kind of reflected
light, some kind of "camera flare."

121
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,660
Okay?

122
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,500
Ain't no damn camera flare.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,710
They say I'm a post-Trauma case.

124
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,670
So what?

125
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,060
Bank goes and fires me.

126
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,990
It don't matter.

127
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,540
The man-Droid is still out there.

128
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,190
If the law won't hunt this
thing down, I'll do it myself.

129
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,600
You see, this thing, I-It kills the real
person, makes it look like a suicide,

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,990
Then it sort of like morphs into that person, cases
the job for a while till it knows the take is fat,

131
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,790
And then it finds its opening.

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,620
Now, these robberies,
they're grouped together,

133
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,470
So I figure the man-Droid is holed up somewhere
in the middle -Underground maybe -I don't know.

134
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,000
M-Maybe that's where it recharges
its m-Man-Droid batteries.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,020
Okay.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,620
I want you to listen very carefully.

137
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,400
'Cause I'm about to tell you the
god's honest truth about all of this.

138
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,570
There's no such thing as man-Droids.

139
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,220
There's nothing evil or
inhuman going on out there.

140
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,190
It's just people.

141
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:50,950
Nothing else.

142
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,860
You understand?

143
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,600
The laser eyes just a
camera flare, mr.Resnick.

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,530
I know you don't want to believe this, but
your friend juan robbed the bank, and that's it.

145
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,010
Get out of my house!

146
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,000
Now!

147
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,050
Sure.

148
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,460
First things first.

149
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,520
Man, that has got to be
the kicker, straight up.

150
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,380
When you told that poor son of a bitch to -What
did you say, "remand" the tapes that he copied?

151
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,290
"Classified evidence of
an ongoing investigation"?

152
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,520
That's messed up.

153
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,270
What are you, pissed at me?

154
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,290
No, I just think it's a little
creepy how good of a fed you are.

155
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,430
We could have thrown the guy a bone.

156
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,900
He did some good legwork here.

157
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,890
"Man-Droid"?

158
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,890
Except for the man-Droid part.

159
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,320
I liked him.

160
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,730
He's not that different from you and me.

161
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,550
People think we're crazy.

162
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,780
Except he's not a hunter.

163
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,450
He's just a guy who
stumbled onto something real.

164
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,980
If he were to go up against
this thing, he'd get torn apart.

165
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,740
Better to stay in the
dark and stay alive.

166
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,780
Yeah, I guess.

167
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,680
Shapeshifter.

168
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,890
Just like back in st.Louis.

169
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,700
Same retinal reaction to video.

170
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,610
Eyes flare at the camera.

171
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,700
I hate those freaking things.

172
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,060
You think I don't?

173
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,230
One didn't turn into you
and frame you for murder.

174
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,610
Well, look, if this shifter's anything like the
one we killed in missouri then ronald's right.

175
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,970
All right, they like to lair up
underground, preferably the sewer.

176
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,900
All the robberies have been
connected so far, right?

177
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,650
Through the, uh, sewer main layout.

178
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,830
There's one more bank lined
up on that same sewer main.

179
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,560
Well, we haven't had any
flags go up on our system yet.

180
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,750
No, no, this is a glitch
in the overall grid.

181
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,950
Just want to make sure the
branch monitors are kosher.

182
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,770
Better to be safe than sorry, I guess.

183
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,580
That's the plan.

184
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,450
All righty.

185
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,120
You guys need anything else?

186
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,780
Oh, no, no, no.

187
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,270
We'll be in and out.

188
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,360
Just a routine check.

189
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,470
Okeydokey.

190
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,280
I like him.

191
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,490
He says "okeydokey."

192
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,620
What if he's the shifter?

193
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,100
Well, then we follow him home, put a
silver bullet through his chest plate.

194
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,300
Okay.

195
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,820
You got any popcorn?

196
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,770
Looks like mr.Okeydokey'S...

197
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,250
Okeydokey.

198
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,880
Maybe we jumped the gun on this, dean.

199
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,040
We don't even know it's here.

200
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,130
Maybe we should just
go to the sewers and...

201
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,960
And...

202
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,400
And...

203
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,700
Dean, we're supposed
to be looking for eyes.

204
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,930
I'm getting there.

205
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,390
Oh, yeah?

206
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,420
Yeah.

207
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,850
Wait a minute.

208
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,940
Hello, freak.

209
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
Got him.

210
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:12,930
Sam.

211
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,290
What?

212
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,450
Hello, ronald.

213
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,280
This is not a robbery!

214
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,940
Everybody on the floor now!

215
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,040
Get down, damn it!

216
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,260
Come on!

217
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,810
On the floor, on the floor.

218
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,260
In the middle!

219
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,080
On the floor in the middle.

220
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,020
In middle, on the floor, come on!

221
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,730
Hurry up!

222
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,630
Come on!

223
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,140
And you said we shouldn't bring guns.

224
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,820
I didn't know this
was gonna happen, dean.

225
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,700
Let me do the talking.

226
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,510
I don't think he likes
you, agent johnson.

227
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:12,600
There's only one way in or out of here, and I
chained it up, so nobody's leaving, you understand?

228
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,640
Hey, buddy.

229
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,730
Why don't you calm down?

230
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,890
Just calm down.

231
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,370
What?

232
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,460
You!

233
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,010
Get on the floor now!

234
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,050
Okay, we're doing that.

235
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,290
Just don't shoot anybody, especially us.

236
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,180
I knew it -As soon as you two left.

237
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,230
You ain't fbi.

238
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,310
Who are you?

239
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,610
Who are you working for, huh?

240
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,770
The men in black?

241
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,380
You working for the man-Droid?

242
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,520
We're not!

243
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,000
You shut up!

244
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,050
I ain't talking to you!

245
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,440
I don't like you!

246
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,730
Fair enough.

247
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,800
Get over there.

248
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,630
Frisk them down, make
sure they got no weapons.

249
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,560
Go!

250
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,910
And what have we here?

251
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm not just gonna walk in here naked.

252
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,000
Give that there.

253
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,680
No, no, no, no.

254
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,460
We know you don't want to hurt anybody.

255
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,510
But that's what's gonna happen
if you keep waving that cannon.

256
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,830
Why don't you let these people go?

257
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,680
No!

258
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,820
I already told you.

259
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,850
If nobody's gonna stop this thing,
then I've got to do it myself!

260
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,120
We believe you!

261
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,900
That's why we're here.

262
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,150
You don't believe me!

263
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,580
Nobody believes me!

264
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,780
How could they?

265
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,390
Come here.

266
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,640
What?

267
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,730
No.

268
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,690
You're holding the gun, boss.

269
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,440
You're calling the shots.

270
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,820
I just want to tell
you something.Come here.

271
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,100
It's the bank manager.

272
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,690
What?

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,980
Why do you think we
got these getups, huh?

274
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,100
We've been monitoring
the cameras in the back.

275
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,610
We saw the bank manager.

276
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,020
We saw his eyes.

277
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,140
His laser eyes?

278
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,900
Yes.

279
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,350
No.

280
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,710
No!

281
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,740
We're running out of time.

282
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,710
We got to find him before
he changes into someone else.

283
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,690
Like I'm gonna listen to you.

284
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,310
You're a damn liar.

285
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,030
I'll shoot you!

286
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,070
Get down!

287
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,140
Take me.

288
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,670
Take me as a hostage.

289
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,930
But we got to act fast because the longer we
just sit here, the more time he has to change.

290
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,420
Look at me, man.

291
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,210
I believe you.

292
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,250
You're not crazy.

293
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,850
There really is something
inside this bank.

294
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,040
All right.

295
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,260
Y-You come with me.

296
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,230
But everyone else gets in the vault!

297
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,470
Come on, move!

298
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,320
Move, move!

299
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,580
Then you lock it up.

300
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,630
It's okay, everyone.

301
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,490
Just stay cool.

302
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,400
Now spin that.

303
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,260
Spin that there.

304
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,340
Who is that man?

305
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,520
He's my brother.

306
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,920
He is so brave.

307
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,520
Check behind the desk.

308
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,560
What the hell is that?

309
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,620
Oh, great.

310
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,020
When it changes form,
it sheds its old skin.

311
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,460
So now it could be anybody.

312
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,420
So...

313
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,090
So weird.

314
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,350
Its robot skin is so lifelike.

315
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,390
Okay, let's get something straight.

316
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,730
It's not a man-Droid.

317
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,210
It's a shapeshifter.

318
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,820
Shapeshifter?

319
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,680
Yeah.

320
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,620
It's human, more or less.

321
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,050
It has human drive.

322
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,420
And in this case, it's money.

323
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,710
But it generates its own skin.

324
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,330
It can shape it to match
someone else's features

325
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,770
So I-It kills someone and
then takes their place.

326
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,500
Kills them -I don't think it matters.

327
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
What are you doing?

328
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,080
Nice.

329
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,100
You remember the old werewolf stories?

330
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,390
Pretty much came from these guys.

331
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,730
Silver's the only thing
I've seen that hurts them.

332
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,620
Come on, ronald.

333
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,010
How we doing?

334
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,690
Another day in paradise.

335
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,130
No one's come out yet?

336
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,770
This guy locked himself in.

337
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,830
First thing he did.

338
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,710
All right.

339
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,000
Cut the power.

340
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,630
What are you, nuts?

341
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,810
That's just it.

342
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,180
I'm not nuts.

343
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,120
I mean, I was so scared that I was
losing my marbles, but this is real.

344
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,330
I mean, I-I was right.

345
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,910
Except for the man-Droid thing.

346
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,690
Thank you.

347
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,550
Yeah, don't mention it.

348
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,770
Damn it.

349
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

350
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
What is it?

351
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,770
They cut the power.

352
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,220
It's probably their way of saying hi.

353
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,070
Who?

354
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,070
Cops.

355
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,170
The cops?

356
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,940
You weren't exactly a smooth
criminal about this, ron.

357
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,050
You didn't even secure
the security guard.

358
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,030
He probably called them.

359
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,860
Well, I didn't think to hang on.

360
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,850
Let's just take a breath for a second.

361
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,220
They probably got us surrounded.

362
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,370
They cut the power to the cameras, so there's
no way of telling who the shapeshifter is.

363
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,510
It's not looking good, ron.

364
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,670
Did you hear that?

365
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,700
Has your brother always been so...

366
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,630
Wonderful?

367
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,960
I mean, staring down that gun.

368
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,540
And the way he played right into that psycho's
crazy head, telling him what he wanted to hear?

369
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,590
Hero or something.

370
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,600
Yeah.

371
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,910
Yeah.

372
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,770
Oh, my g-You saved us!

373
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,130
You saved us!

374
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,720
Actually I just found a few more.

375
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:03,970
Come on, everybody, let's go.

376
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,840
Let's go.

377
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,670
What are you doing?

378
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,080
Sam, look, ronald and
i need to talk to you.

379
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,970
It shed its skin again.

380
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,920
We don't know when.

381
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,530
Could be in the halls, the vault.

382
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,700
Great.

383
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,450
You know, dean, you are
wanted by the police.

384
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,360
Yeah.

385
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,760
So even if we do find this damn thing,
how the hell are we gonna get out of here?

386
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,350
One problem at a time.

387
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,710
I'm gonna do a sweep of the whole
place, see if I can find any stragglers.

388
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,480
Once we get everyone together,
we got to play "find the freak."

389
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,610
So here.

390
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,130
I found another one of these for you.

391
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,150
Now, stay here.

392
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,850
Make sure ronald doesn't hurt anybody.

393
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,360
Help him manage the help him manage?

394
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,090
Are you insane?

395
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,160
Look, I know this isn't
going the way we wanted.

396
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,990
Understatement.

397
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,000
But if we invite the cops in right now, ronald gets
arrested, we get arrested, the shifter gets away.

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,820
Probably never find
it again, okay -Ron!

399
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,800
Out of the light!

400
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,420
Seriously?

401
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,840
Ron's plan was a bad plan.

402
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,670
It was a bit of a crazy plan, but right
now, crazy's the only game in town, okay?

403
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,710
Hi, ronald.

404
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm gonna keep this open, get you folks
some fresh air in there, all right?

405
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,240
But no one leaves this vault.

406
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,340
I don't understand.

407
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,880
Why are you helping him?

408
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,800
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

409
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,720
H-Hello?

410
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,040
I think I got to get out of here.

411
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,200
Sir, I'm very sorry, but you're
just gonna have to stay put.

412
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,360
What do you mean, demands?

413
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,390
Ronald...

414
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,160
Hang up.

415
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,700
I-I'm not a bank robber.

416
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,360
I got to really get out of here.

417
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,350
Sir, you can't leave.

418
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,400
Kind of a crime fighter, I guess.

419
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,530
Ronald!

420
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:20,820
Look...

421
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,470
No, I'm acting alone.

422
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,040
Ronald...

423
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,320
The less the cops know, the better.

424
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,190
I think this dude's
having a heart attack!

425
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,590
Great.

426
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,250
Could be our guy, could be a trick.

427
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,410
Are you just gonna let the man die?

428
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,740
No one's dying in here!

429
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,990
Cover the door.

430
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,450
Can you tell me how many
hostages this guy's taken?

431
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,650
One of the people in here
could be having heart trouble.

432
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,020
You need to send in a paramedic.

433
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,600
Just stay calm, sir.

434
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,280
Just send in a paramedic, okay?!

435
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,700
Don't try anything else!

436
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,990
Please.

437
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,860
Paramedic?

438
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,130
Guy don't have time for that, man.

439
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,460
Listen, I-I'm sorry, okay?

440
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,560
But nobody's getting out.

441
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,940
He's dying right in front of you.

442
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,000
Help.

443
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,400
Come on, man.

444
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,740
You got to unlock the front door.

445
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,560
We got to get him out of here.

446
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,170
Both of you stay where you are!

447
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,250
You know what, ronald?

448
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,740
He's right.

449
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,410
We got to get this man outside.

450
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:00,930
Come on.

451
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,760
I got you.

452
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,370
I'll help you.

453
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,010
Oh, I got him.

454
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,130
It's cool.

455
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,090
Thanks.

456
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,260
Watch your step.

457
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:08,720
Thank you.

458
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,240
Sure.

459
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,010
Thank you.

460
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,010
Let's go up these steps.

461
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,420
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

462
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,150
You have the gun, man.

463
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,300
Whatever.

464
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:35,930
Stop!

465
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,380
Come back here!

466
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,300
Here.

467
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,130
Take care of the guard.

468
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,920
I'm going after the shifter.

469
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,970
Sorry, ron.

470
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,340
You did a real good
job tracking this thing.

471
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,230
You really did.

472
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,120
Oh, god, please don't hurt us.

473
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,730
You shouldn't be back here right now!

474
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,480
You're in danger!

475
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,410
Now go back to the vault, now.

476
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,020
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Please!

477
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,160
No, no, no, no!

478
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Back up!

479
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,590
Don't even think about it!

480
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,080
Please, don't shoot!

481
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,610
I said get back now!

482
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,410
One of the hostages seems to
have taken over the situation.

483
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,800
Excuse me?

484
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,240
Go, go, go.

485
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,100
We are so screwed.

486
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,640
Yeah?

487
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,830
Slipped his skin.

488
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,560
What?

489
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,960
Yeah, bastard shifts fast, a lot
faster than the one in st.Louis.

490
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,650
It's like playing a shell game.

491
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,910
It could be anybody again.

492
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,960
I think most of the
employees are in the vault.

493
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,400
You search every inch of this place.

494
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,850
I'm gonna go round everybody up.

495
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,170
Crap.

496
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,060
What?

497
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,450
The feds are here.

498
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,870
Oh, crap.

499
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,670
Lieutenant robards.

500
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,070
Yeah.

501
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,910
Special agent hendrickson.

502
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,030
Let me guess.

503
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,390
You're lead dog now, but you would
just love my full cooperation.

504
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,820
I don't give a rat's ass what you do.

505
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,070
You can go get a doughnut and
bang your wife for all I care.

506
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,750
What I do need is your
S.W.A.T.Team locked and loaded.

507
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,610
Listen, agent, something's
not right about this.

508
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,150
It's, uh...

509
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,340
It's not going down like a usual heist.

510
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,830
That's because it isn't one.

511
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,570
You have no idea what
you're dealing with, do you?

512
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,680
There is a monster
in that bank, robards.

513
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,310
And I thought you were
one of the good guys.

514
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:10,940
What's your name?

515
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,290
Why would you care?

516
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,450
My name's dean.

517
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,280
I'm sheri.

518
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,270
Hi, sheri.

519
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,690
Everything's gonna be all right.

520
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,500
This will all be over soon, okay?

521
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:38,780
Yeah.

522
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,680
This is special agent
victor hendrickson.

523
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,060
I'm not really in a negotiating mood.

524
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,190
Good.Me neither.

525
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,990
It's my job to bring you in
-Alive's a bonus, but not necessary.

526
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,300
That's harsh for a federal
agent, don't you think?

527
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,320
Well, you're not the typical
suspect, are you, dean?

528
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,850
I want you and sam out
here unarmed, or we come in.

529
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,380
And, yes, I know about
sam -Bonnie to your clyde.

530
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,650
Yeah, well, that part's true, but
how'd you even know we were here?

531
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,510
Go screw yourself.

532
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,560
That's how I knew.

533
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,780
It's become my job to
know about you, dean.

534
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,730
I've been looking for you for weeks now.

535
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,200
I know about the murder in st.Louis,
the houdini act you pulled in baltimore.

536
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,610
I know about the
desecrations and the thefts.

537
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,900
I know about your dad.

538
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,020
You don't know crap about my dad.

539
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:24,290
Ex-Marine, raised his kids on the road, cheap motels,
backwood cabins -Real paramilitary survivalist type.

540
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,680
I just can't get a handle on what type of wacko he
was -White supremist, timmy mcveigh, tomato, tomahto.

541
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,110
You got no right talking
about my dad like that.

542
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,800
He was a hero.

543
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,030
Yeah, right.

544
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,170
Sure sounds like it.

545
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,980
You have one hour to make a decision, or
we come through those doors full automatic.

546
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,230
Scramble your men.

547
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,570
Five minutes, then we go in.

548
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,450
What?

549
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,090
Hendrickson, they've let
out one hostage so far.

550
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,430
They've hurt no one
as far as we can tell.

551
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,950
You don't know these winchesters.

552
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,620
They're dangerous and expertly trained.

553
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,590
We can't risk the lives
of all those people.

554
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,530
Dean's a greater risk
to them than we are.

555
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,360
This is crazy.

556
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,140
Crazy's in there, and
I just hung up on it.

557
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,010
Amn it.

558
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,300
We got a bit of a problem outside.

559
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,940
We got a problem in here.

560
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,440
Sheri?

561
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,140
We're gonna let you go.

562
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,440
What?

563
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,340
Why me?

564
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,360
As a show of good faith
to the feds.Come on.

565
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,430
I think I'd rather stay
here with the others.

566
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.

567
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,600
I thought you were letting me go.

568
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,440
Oh, god!

569
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,420
Was that community theater, or
are you just naturally that good?

570
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,880
This is the last time
you become anybody, ever.

571
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,240
God

572
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,980
Dean, wait, wait, wait.

573
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,220
What's the advantage of this plan?

574
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,080
I mean, fainting now
wouldn't help it survive.

575
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,990
No!

576
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,820
Get her out of here now!

577
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,580
Don't shoot!

578
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,700
Don't shoot!

579
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,040
I work here.

580
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,150
I work here.

581
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,690
Gross.

582
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,930
Move!

583
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,460
Clear!

584
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,330
Move!

585
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,330
Clear.

586
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,690
Move.

587
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,780
Clear.

588
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,060
Male, african-American, goner.

589
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,230
Telling you, man, I just
walked her out of the bank.

590
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,650
She must have a twin
sister or something.

591
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,820
Sir, my team said it's secure.

592
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,440
They're gone.

593
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,040
You tell your team to tear it apart
-The ducts, the ceilings, everything.

594
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,220
I don't think that's necessary.

595
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,360
Why not?

596
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,100
We are so screwed.
