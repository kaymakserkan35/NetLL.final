1
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,830
and the second you find 
out this ruby chick is a demon,

2
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,230
you go for the holy water.

3
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,360
you don't chat.no one was chatting,dean.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,200
then why didn't you send her ass back to hell?

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,560
she told me she could help you,okay?

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,260
she knows what your weakness is.it's me.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,330
think something's wrong 
with my brother?no. demons lie.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,360
last i checked,dean's still going to hell.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,560
everything in its own time,sam.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,000
you're gonna have to do things

11
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,930
that go against that gentle nature of yours.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,660
on the bright side,i'll be there with you --

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,930
that little fallen angel on your shoulder.

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,300
that was just a terrible,terrible party.

15
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,700
but there was this one really beautiful woman there.

16
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,030
you should have gone home
with her.

17
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,530
i did.

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,230
i need a few minutes.

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,700
all right.

20
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,260
there's a bottle of '89 in the fridge.

21
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
oh,god.

22
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,760
what the...

23
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,400
paul!

24
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,700
what is it? it's my teeth.

25
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,060
janet?!

26
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,360
help me!

27
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,430
i couldn't help. i couldn't do anything to stop it.

28
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,900
i-i've talked to the police

29
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,900
and i've talked to the medical examiner

30
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,960
and no one can explain it.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,060
that's why they put the call into us,mr. dutton.

32
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,430
but the cdc --that's disease control,right?

33
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,360
w-what do you think it's some kind of virus?

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,830
we're not ruling out anything yet.

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,960
mr. dutton,did janet have 
any enemies? i'm sorry?

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
anyone that had a reason to hurt her?

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,230
what are you saying that somebody poisoned her?

38
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,060
i'm just saying we have to cover
every base here.

39
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,330
i mean,what kind of poison?

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,200
you think a person could havedone this?

41
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,760
would anyone want to?

42
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
what? no.

43
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,400
no,there's no one that could have...

44
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,460
mr. dutton?

45
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,800
uh,everyone loved janet.

46
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,430
okay.thank you very much.

47
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,930
i think we got everything we need.

48
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,300
we'll be out of your way now.

49
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,030
that dude seem a little evasive to you?

50
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,300
i don't know.

51
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,000
i was under a sink...pulling this out.

52
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,460
hex bag.

53
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,700
ohh,gross.

54
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,760
yeah.

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,500
bird bones,rabbit's teeth.

56
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,830
this cloth was probably cut

57
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,230
from something janet dutton owned.

58
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,030
so we're thinking witch?

59
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,460
uh,yeah.

60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,600
and not some new-age wiccan water douser,either.

61
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,130
this is old-world black magic,dean,

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,700
i mean,warts and all.

63
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,800
i hate witches.

64
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,260
they're always spewing 
their bodily fluids everywhere.

65
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,560
pretty much.it's creepy.

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,030
it's downright unsanitary.

67
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,200
yeah,well,someone 
definitely had it out for janet dutton.

68
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,730
yeah,someone who snuck 
into that house and planted the bag.

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,960
so,what are we thinking?

70
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,060
looking for some craggy old blair bitch in the woods?

71
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,260
no,it could be anyone --

72
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,030
a neighbor,coworker,man,woman.

73
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,160
they're human.they're like everyone else.

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,500
how are we gonna find them?

75
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,000
this wasn't random.

76
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,730
someone in janet dutton's 
life had an ugly ax to grind.

77
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,000
we find the motive...

78
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,830
we find the murderer.yeah.

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,060
amanda?

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
hey,amanda!

81
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,860
oh,elizabeth,hi.

82
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,400
sorry,i've got,like,a thousand things on my mind.

83
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,560
are you okay,sweetie?

84
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,630
you didn't come to book club last night.

85
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,130
yeah,sorry.i was gonna call.

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,600
i just --i got busy,you know?

87
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,700
but i'm fine,really.i am. thanks.

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,100
this dinner was cooked for you,paul arthur dutton.

89
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,060
now you're going to eat it.

90
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,030
got it!

91
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,000
you okay?

92
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,530
what the hell is happening to me?

93
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,760
someone murdered your wife.
now they're trying to kill you.

94
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,500
that's impossible.
there's no way --

95
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,130
if we hadn't been following you,you'd be a doornail.

96
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,700
now,who wants you dead?

97
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,760
i --come on,think.

98
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,100
there's a woman.

99
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,260
okay,a woman.

100
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,100
an affair,a-a mistake.

101
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,330
she was unbalanced.

102
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,730
she was blackmailing me.
i put an end to it a week ago.

103
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,660
what's her name? wha--

104
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,500
what could she have to do with what

105
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,930
paul,what is her name?

106
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,600
that's a curve-ball.

107
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,460
yeah.

108
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,200
three per wrist vertical.

109
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,200
she wasn't fooling around.

110
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,600
that's a curveball.

111
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,460
yeah.

112
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,200
three per wrist --vertical.

113
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,200
she wasn't fooling around.

114
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,500
yeah,looks like she was 
working some heavyweight evil here.

115
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,500
yep.

116
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,830
freaking witches!seriously,man! come on!

117
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,430
guess we know where 
she got the rabbit's teeth from.

118
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,760
paul knows how to pick 'em.

119
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,760
it's like "fatal attraction" all over again.

120
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,560
why's the rabbit always get screwed in the deal?

121
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,300
poor little guy.

122
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,930
you know what i don't get,dean?

123
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,400
if she was so bent on revenge,why do this?

124
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,260
well,she got janet dutton,

125
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,160
thought she finished off paul,

126
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,360
decided to cap herself

127
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,500
and make it a spurned lover's hat trick.

128
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,100
maybe.

129
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,030
this doesn't exactly look like a tv room

130
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,960
of a bright and stable person,you know?

131
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
no.

132
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,830
but then...

133
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,200
...there's this.

134
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,560
another hex bag? come on.

135
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,660
looks like we got a hit,huh?

136
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,860
a little witch-on-witch violence.

137
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,260
i guess.

138
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,500
i'd like to report a dead body at 309 mayfair circle.

139
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,100
my name? yeah,sure,my name is...

140
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,360
why are witches ganking each other?

141
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,200
i don't know,but i think maybe we got a coven on our hands.

142
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,160
all right,all right. i'm going.

143
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,100
i'm not fooled by your little book club,by the way.

144
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,130
i know what you ladies get up to when i'm gone.

145
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,130
it's all dish and gossip.

146
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,500
hi,ron.

147
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,560
oh,hello,elizabeth.

148
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,300
i mean,when's the last time
 anyone actually brought a book?

149
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,200
good night,ron. good night,ron.

150
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,560
all right.

151
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,930
he doesn't know?you didn't tell him?

152
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,330
about amanda?

153
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,260
i think that's book club business,don't you?

154
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,260
thank you,tammi.

155
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,700
the police just took away her body,

156
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,500
and we're just gonna pretend it didn't happen?

157
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,630
he loved amanda.

158
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,100
it's true.

159
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,730
we know that she was a little...unstable.

160
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
also true.

161
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,330
and we have to face it --

162
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,060
she probably killed janet dutton.

163
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,660
people just don't spit out their teeth all of a sudden.

164
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,660
mnh-mnh.

165
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,100
we have to stop.

166
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,230
we have to stop book club.this has all gone too far.

167
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,330
elizabeth,just take a deep breath.

168
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,260
calm down.

169
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
we can't stop.

170
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,530
but people are dying.

171
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,460
amanda killed herself,yes.

172
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,460
and,yes,she killed janet.

173
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,160
awful,awful business,of course,

174
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,300
but that's all over now.

175
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,100
and think about what book club has gotten us,hmm?

176
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,160
your husband's promotion,

177
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,160
that little trip to hawaii that you won.

178
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,530
and what about me?

179
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,600
my home pottery business is finally taking off,

180
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,760
and you want to just stop?

181
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
do you want to stop?

182
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,200
okay. now,come on. we don't have much time.

183
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,330
ron gets back from his fantasy  football in an hour.

184
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,530
all: book of shadows,we kneel before you.

185
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,830
let us serve your master as you serve us.

186
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,000
book of shadows,we kneel before you.

187
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,200
let us serve your master...

188
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,330
sam: you must have a green thumb.

189
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,730
excuse me?

190
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,860
getting these herbs to grow out of season like this.

191
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,830
quite impressive.

192
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,200
i'm sorry. i should have introduced myself first.

193
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,300
i'm,uh,detective bachman,and this is detective turner.

194
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,600
hiya.

195
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,260
we're following up on amanda burns' death.

196
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,730
going around the neighborhood,talking to her neighbors.

197
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,730
but didn't she -- i mean,she killed herself,right?

198
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,630
maybe,maybe.we heard you
 were friends with the deceased,right?

199
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,330
yeah,i guess so.

200
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,200
do you have any idea about her practices?

201
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,830
i'm sorry?what -- what kind of practices?

202
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,130
well,her house was 
littered with satanic paraphernalia.

203
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,300
it was a regular black sabbath.

204
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,730
no,th--but she was an episcopalian.

205
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,130
well,then we're pretty sure

206
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,800
she was using the wrong bible.

207
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,900
renee: elizabeth.

208
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,960
are you all right?

209
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,530
i'm fine.uh,renee,these are detectives.

210
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,300
they say amanda was 
--she was practicing --

211
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,630
sorry,detectives.

212
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,230
you can tell that elizabeth is a little upset.

213
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,600
of course,miss...

214
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,900
mrs.renee van allen.

215
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
would you like me to spell it for you?

216
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,260
i'll get by,thanks.

217
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,430
this amanda business has been hard for liz,

218
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,000
for all of us.

219
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,760
yeah,i mean,you think you know a person.

220
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,660
well,i guess we all have secrets,don't we?

221
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,760
well,thanks. um,we'll be in touch.

222
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,830
have a nice day.

223
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,130
bye.

224
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,000
well,i'm already sold on that elizabeth chick.

225
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,230
did you see that victory garden of hers?

226
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,000
belladonna,wolfsbane,mandrake.

227
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,930
not to mention that little flinch she threw

228
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,360
when we mentioned the occult.

229
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,260
well,she's definitely had a good run lately.

230
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,030
gone up a few tax brackets,
won almost too many raffles --

231
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,060
the kind of thing a little 
black magic always helps with.

232
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,360
yeah.

233
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,200
i don't think she's alone,either.

234
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,030
it looks like mrs.renee van allen

235
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,560
has won almost every craft contest she's entered

236
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,900
in the past three months.

237
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,500
a regular martha stewart,huh?

238
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,060
except for the devil worship.

239
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
i'm thinking that was the coven we met back there,

240
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,700
minus one member.

241
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,100
amanda was clearly going off the reservation.

242
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,130
you think they killed her to keep up appearances?

243
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,200
seems like an appearance 
kind of crowd,don't you think?

244
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,860
yeah.

245
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,400
if they killed a nut job,
should we thank them or what?

246
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,100
they work in black magic,too,dean.

247
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,360
they need to be stopped.

248
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,530
stopped,like stopped?

249
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,460
they're human,sam.

250
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,730
they're murderers.

251
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,230
burn,witch,burn.

252
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,900
ruby.

253
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,800
sam,listen to me. there's no time.

254
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,160
what are you talking about?
you have to get out of town.

255
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,300
so,this is ruby,huh?

256
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,000
never had the pleasure.

257
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,760
dean.i was hoping you'd show up again.

258
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,430
point that thing somewhere else.

259
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,130
ha ha ha ha.right.

260
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,560
sam,please. go.

261
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,330
get in the car and don't look back.

262
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,730
why? i don't understand.

263
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,260
hey,hot stuff,we can take care

264
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,830
of a few kitchen witches,thanks.

265
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,760
i'm not talking about witches,you jackass.

266
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,160
witches are whores.

267
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,230
i'm talking about who they serve.

268
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,330
demons.

269
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,660
they get their power from demons.

270
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
yeah.

271
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,460
and there's one here now.

272
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
oh,what,you mean besides you?

273
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,460
sam,it knows you're in town,
and it's gonna come after you,

274
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,930
and it's way more than you can handle.

275
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
oh,come on. what is this,huh?

276
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,460
please tell me you're not listening to this crap.

277
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,930
put a leash on your brother,
sam,if you want to keep him.

278
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,060
dean,just chill out.no! no!

279
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,200
she's messing with your head! god knows why.

280
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,200
that's who they are!

281
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,230
i'm telling you the truth.

282
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,660
i'm telling you to shut up,bitch!

283
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,160
i'm sorry. why are you 
even a part of this conversation?

284
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,930
maybe because he's 
my brother,you black-eyed skank!

285
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,500
<i>oh,right,right. 
and you care about your brother so much.</i>

286
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,660
that's why you're checking out,
leaving him all alone.shut up.

287
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,800
let me try and save him

288
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,360
since you won't be here to do it anymore.

289
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
i said shut up!dean,no!

290
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,280
what the hell were you thinking?

291
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,480
what? what the hell was i thinking?

292
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,450
she's a demon,sam,period.all right?

293
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,310
they want us dead.we want them dead.

294
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,480
oh,that's funny.

295
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,110
i remember that demon chick in ohio --

296
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,610
casey -- you didn't want her dead.

297
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,950
well,she wasn't stringing me
along like a fish on a hook.

298
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,010
no one's stringing me along!

299
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,210
look,i know it's dangerous that she is dangerous

300
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,880
but like it or not,she's useful.

301
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,110
no! we kill her before she kills us.

302
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,410
kill her with what? the gun she fixed for us?

303
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,880
whatever works.

304
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,150
dean,if she wants us dead,

305
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,180
all she has to do is stop saving our lives.

306
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,910
look,we have to start
 looking at the big picture,dean.

307
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,110
start thinking in strategies and and moves ahead.

308
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,250
it's not so simple.we're not just hunting anymore.

309
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,680
we're at war.

310
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,310
are you feeling okay?

311
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,980
why are you always asking me that?

312
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,610
because you're taking advice from a demon,for starters.

313
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,910
and,by the way,

314
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,810
you seem less and less worried about offing people.

315
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,180
it used to eat you up inside.

316
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,780
and what has that gotten me?

317
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,150
nothing,but it's just 
want you're supposed to do,okay?

318
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,050
we're supposed to drive in the freaking car

319
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,910
and freaking argue about this stuff!

320
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,080
you go on about the sanctity
of life and all that crap.

321
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,680
wait,so you're mad 
because i'm starting to agree with you?

322
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,350
no,i'm not mad!

323
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,080
i'm -- i'm...

324
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,550
i'm worried.

325
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,850
sam,i'm worried because 
you're not acting like yourself.

326
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,710
yeah,you're right.i'm not.

327
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,350
i don't have a choice.

328
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,050
what is that supposed to mean?

329
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,280
look,dean,you're leaving,right?

330
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,910
and i got to stay here
 in this crap hole of a world...

331
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,750
alone.

332
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,480
so,the way i see it,if i'm gonna make it,

333
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,450
if i'm gonna fight this war after you're gone,

334
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,610
then i got to change.

335
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,380
change into what?

336
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,380
into you.

337
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,750
i got to be more like you.

338
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,410
what's going on with you?

339
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,410
i don't know.

340
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,650
sam,something's wrong.

341
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,280
a bunch of knives inside of me.

342
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,150
dean? son of a bitch.

343
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,310
dean. ohh!

344
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,580
the coven,man.it's got to be the coven.

345
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,410
dean,i can't find it!

346
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,980
no.

347
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,810
sam,what are you doing?

348
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,280
sam!

349
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,450
sam!

350
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,050
oh,my god!

351
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,080
let him go.

352
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,710
let who go?what are you doing?

353
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,410
you're insane. get out!

354
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,050
look,if you know about me,
then you know about this gun.

355
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,550
you're killing my brother.now let him go.

356
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,210
get away from the altar.what?

357
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,210
now!

358
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,010
you want to kill me?get in line,bitch.

359
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,880
stop...calling me bitch.

360
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,010
go.

361
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,510
what? w-w-we weren't hurting anyone.

362
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,010
please,we don't even know your brother.

363
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,380
stop the spell or die.

364
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,410
five seconds.what?!

365
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,410
no,please.please don't kill us.

366
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,750
we were just getting 
renee a lower mortgage rate.

367
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,510
next time you point that gun at me,

368
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,280
i'm not gonna just disappear,understand?

369
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,680
you...saved my life.

370
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,080
don't mention it.

371
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,880
what was that stuff?

372
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,610
god,it was ass.

373
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,550
it tasted like ass.

374
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,410
it's called witchcraft,short bus.

375
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,510
you're the short bus.

376
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,280
"short bus."

377
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,250
okay,maybe it's not you...

378
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,880
...or you.

379
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,750
maybe it's you.

380
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,450
i-i don't even know what he's talking about.

381
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,150
what are you even talking about?

382
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,310
i mean,all of you everyone in your little coven.

383
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,150
you've all had runs of good fortune --

384
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,650
newsworthy good fortune.

385
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,110
except for you,tammi.

386
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,980
now,tell me,why is that?

387
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,650
you didn't want anything for yourself,

388
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,350
or is it because you're 
already getting what you wanted,

389
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,050
like these women's souls?

390
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,610
i can't -- i'm not --i-i-i don't...

391
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,710
nice dick work,magnum.

392
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,310
let...my brother...go.

393
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,150
what's wrong?couldn't find my hex bag?

394
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,380
sorry,sweetheart,

395
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,780
but your brother's lungs
 should be on the floor by now.

396
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,850
you're in a lot of trouble,sam.

397
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,550
tammi,what's wrong with your eyes?

398
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,850
tammi,what are you doing?

399
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,350
renee,shut your painted hole.

400
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,850
what?

401
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,480
i-i will -- you can't --

402
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,780
not in my house,tammi benton.

403
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,050
look! you got me!

404
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,180
let the girl go.

405
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,610
wait your turn,young man.

406
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,210
ohh,god!

407
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,410
lizzy,it's okay.

408
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,310
you're not tammi?

409
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,280
I no. but i'm wearing her meat.

410
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,750
i had to break the ice with you girls somehow.

411
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,450
you killed renee.

412
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,180
renee,amanda.

413
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,780
that's what happens to 
witches who get voted off the island.

414
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,110
who are you?

415
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,550
funny story,actually.

416
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,110
you remember all those dark,demonic forces

417
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,350
you prayed to when you swore your servitude?

418
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,580
just who did you think you were praying to?

419
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,410
this -- this isn't --it can't be.

420
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,510
what did you think it was?

421
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,850
make-believe,positive thinking,

422
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,150
the secret?

423
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,910
no. it was me.

424
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,450
you sold yourself to me,you pig.

425
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,710
all i had to do was 
bring one good book to book club,

426
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,280
and you ladies lined up to kiss my ass.

427
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,310
no. no.we didn't know --

428
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,750
oh,yes,you did.

429
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,210
you knew every step of the way,

430
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,450
and now your ever-living souls are mine.

431
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,580
comments,questions?

432
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,510
sammy winchester,wow.

433
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,410
right here in our little town.

434
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,050
you know,my friends 
and i we've been looking for you.

435
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,480
why?

436
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,180
oh,right,because i'm supposed

437
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,980
to lead some piss-poor demon army.

438
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,350
no,not at all.you're not our messiah.

439
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,510
we don't believe in you.

440
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,310
but there's a new leader rising in the west.

441
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,950
a real leader.

442
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,050
that's the horse to bet on,sam,

443
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,150
the one who's gonna tear this world apart.

444
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,810
thing is,this demon it doesn't like you very much.

445
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,280
it doesn't want the competition.

446
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,850
nothing personal.it's a p.r. thing.

447
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,410
so,bye-bye.

448
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,710
two for one.lovely.

449
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,350
wait.

450
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,550
please.

451
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,580
i just...came to talk.

452
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,410
you made it out of the gate.

453
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,010
impressive.

454
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,680
it was a bitch of a fight,wasn't it?

455
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,380
doors out of hell only open for so long.

456
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,850
what do you want,ruby?

457
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,110
i've been lost without you.

458
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,710
take me back.

459
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,880
that's why i led the winchesters here.

460
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:49,080
they're for you...as a gift.

461
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,410
really?

462
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,080
let me serve you again.

463
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,680
i've wanted it.

464
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,910
i've wanted you for so long.

465
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,550
you were one of my best.

466
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,510
but then again,you always were a lying whore.

467
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,510
tammi: you're really 
telling me you threw in your chips

468
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,110
with abbott and costello here?

469
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,750
come on. get up.

470
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,950
i said get up!

471
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,380
we've been here before,haven't we?

472
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,850
she didn't tell you?

473
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,650
pretty mortifying,i guess.

474
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,410
she was one of mine.

475
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,480
i turned her out a long,long time ago.

476
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,110
ruby here was a witch.

477
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,280
of course,that was when you were human.

478
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,080
oh,didn't want your friends to know

479
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,850
that all those centuries back,you sold yourself to me?

480
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,110
embarrassing,i guess.

481
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,380
but don't worry,love.

482
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,780
no secrets where you're heading,remember?

483
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,950
go.

484
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,810
i'll clean up this mess.

485
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,580
come on.

486
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,650
go.

487
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,450
so,the devil may care after all.

488
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,210
is that what i'm supposed to believe?

489
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,580
i don't believe in the devil.

490
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,050
wacky night.

491
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,080
so,let me get this straight.

492
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,450
you were human once.

493
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,480
you died,you went to hell,and you became a...

494
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,680
yeah.

495
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,280
how long ago?

496
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,380
back when the plague was big.

497
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:34,580
so,all of them every damn demon

498
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,550
they were all human once?

499
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,210
everyone i've ever met.

500
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,080
well,they sure don't act like it.

501
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,980
most of them have forgotten what it means...

502
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,510
or even that they were.

503
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,550
that's what happens when you go to hell,dean.

504
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,810
that's what hell is --

505
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,080
forgetting what you are.

506
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,280
philosophy lesson from a demon.

507
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,880
i'll pass,thanks.

508
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,750
it's not philosophy. it's not a metaphor.

509
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,350
there's a real fire in the pit,

510
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,980
agonies you can't even imagine.

511
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,480
no,i saw "hellraiser." i get the gist.

512
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,250
actually,they got that pretty close...

513
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,980
except for all the custom leather.

514
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,010
the answer is yes,by the way.

515
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,350
sorry?

516
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,280
yes,the same thing will happen to you.

517
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,450
it might take centuries,

518
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,210
but sooner or later,
hell will burn away your humanity.

519
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,480
every hell-bound soul,

520
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,050
everyone,turns into something else.

521
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,550
turns you into us,so,yeah --

522
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,950
yeah,you can count on it.

523
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,310
there's no way of saving me from the pit,is there?

524
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,680
no.

525
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,250
why'd you tell sam that you could?

526
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,450
so he would talk to me.

527
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,610
you winchesters can be pretty bigoted,

528
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,010
and i needed something 
to help him get past the --

529
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,310
the demon thing?

530
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,550
that's pretty hard to get past.

531
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,950
look at you...

532
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,310
trying to be all stoic.

533
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,110
my god,it's heartbreaking.

534
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,710
why are you telling me all this?

535
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,410
i need your help.

536
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,250
-help with what? -with sam.

537
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,010
the way you stuck that demon tonight

538
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,850
it was pretty tough.

539
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,580
sam's almost there,but not quite.

540
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,710
you need to help me get him ready...

541
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,410
for life without you.

542
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,880
to fight this war on his own.

543
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,510
ruby.

544
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,210
why do you want us to win?

545
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,550
isn't it obvious?

546
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,250
i'm not like them.

547
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,710
i don't know why.

548
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,750
i wish i was,but i'm not.

549
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,980
i remember what it's like.

550
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,780
what what's like?

551
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,080
being human.

00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
