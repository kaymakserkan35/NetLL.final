to do with this story?

147

No, it's just...

148
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,150
Okay, I get it, the two of you
bonded, which is probably
why you haven't been sued.

149

150

like to think

Confirming Behcet's.

154
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:56,532
I gave her some prednisone,
an antacid, and I ran
a pathergy test on her arm.

155
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,600
Takes 24 hours to confirm.

156
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,509
Told her any doctor
could check it out.

157
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,673
You didn't make
an appointment.
Nope.

158
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,215

159

Dr. Chase?
Hi.

160
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,115
All right,
let's take a look.

161
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,126
Okay, those little pustules
mean it's positive.

162
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,928
Talk to Nurse Preven,
get an appointment with
Dr. Brustin in Rheumatology.

163
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,936
Behcet's is very treatable,
you're gonna be fine.

164
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,131
Okay. Thanks.

165
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,334
And you were just chatting
on the phone with someone

166
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,842
and she happened
to run into you.

167
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,003
That's what happened.

168
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,309
No appointment,
no real examination?

169
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,042
Just gave her
the test results.

170
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,311
So, lower standard of care,

171
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,047
you really couldn't
be expected to notice
there was anything else wrong.

172
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,316
We didn't even go
into an exam room.

173
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:53,461
As your lawyer,
I can't stop you from lying,
I can't even be in the room.

174
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,696
But I would be remiss
if I didn't prep you
to lie better.

175
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,701
You wrote her a prescription,
which means
there was an examination.

176
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,298
What really happened?

177
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,510
I was on the phone.

178
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,409
Dr. Chase? Hi.

179
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,176
Hi.

180
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,845
Kayla. I'm here
for the test. My arm.

181
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,047
Oh, yeah.

182
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,847
Okay.

183
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,983
It's positive.

184
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:26,122
Talk to Nurse Preven,
get an appointment with
Dr. Brustin in Rheumatology.

185
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,167
I took that medicine
you gave me,
but my stomach still hurts.

186
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,935
Behcet's could be
stronger than we thought,

187
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,841
or it could be reflux
from the prednisone.

188
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,775
Here's a stronger antacid.

189
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,914
Doctor?
Yes?

190
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,442
Nothing.

191
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,390
STACY:
You didn't ask her anything
about the stomach pain?

192
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,690
I made one little mistake.

193
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,697
As little mistakes go,
that was a biggie.

194
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,329
She's only advising Chase?
Not you?

195
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,475
Well, what's
the committee gonna do to me?
I never even met this patient.

196
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,238
Your disdain for
human interaction

197
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,836
doesn't exculpate you,
it inculpates you.

198
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,144
You signed the charts,
you're responsible
for everything Chase does.

199
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,615
Which is why
this doesn't matter.

200
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,379
She protects Chase,
she protects me.

201
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,253
Unless her advice
to Chase is to make a deal
and give you up.

202
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,592
"I'm so sorry,
if only Dr. House
had paid attention.

203
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,524
"He never even met her,
he never does."

204
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,097
Chase loves me.
And isn't Turkish.

205
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,899
Cameron loves you,
Chase loves his job.

206
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,301
You really think
Stacy hates me that much?

207
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,535
I think right now
she hates you
more than enough.

208
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,872
You think emotion
only affects
doctors' judgments?

209
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,147
Everything stemmed
from that one interaction.

210
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,344
They're gonna
slam you on it.

211
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,650
Were you distracted?
Your problem. Overworked?
That's their problem.

212
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,053
Forgetful, yours, lazy...

213
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,853
I just figured
the stomach pain
was the Behcet's.

214
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,290
Any doctor would have
thought the same.

215
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,659
Then why did you
call her an hour
after she left the clinic?

216
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,562
Nurse Preven said
you asked her to have
Kayla come back in.

217
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:11,569
The way she hesitated,
I thought she might have had
a doorknob question.

218
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,732
Patient comes in,

219
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,741
says he's got a sniffly nose,
you examine him for
10 minutes, right?

220
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,470
Then you're leaving,
hand on the doorknob,

221
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,843
and he says, "Oh, yeah,
and my penis
has turned green."

222
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,382
Embarrassing question,
the only important one,
patient saves it for last.

223
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,908
So you knew she was
about to ask
the most important question

224
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,379
and you left.

225
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,322
No, I didn't.
I figured it out later.

226
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,619
What changed?

227
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,787
Nothing.
Bad answer.

228
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,762
I wasn't thinking
clearly at first.
Worse answer.

229
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,592
So what was her
doorknob question?

230
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,269
I figured it might be
blood in her stool,

231
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,935
which could indicate
a bleeding ulcer.

232
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,162
CHASE: Talk to me.

233
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,367
Thirty-five year old female,
vomiting massive
amounts of blood,

234
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,470
LOC at work, BP 80
over 20, heart rate 140.
You push fluids?

235
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,175
Three liters in the field,
and we're bolusing
another one right now.

236
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,682
It's gotta be
a bleeding ulcer, Doc.

237
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,016
Her coworkers said
she's been eating
ibuprofens like candy.

238
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,985
I thought
she had Behcet's!

239
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,316
One, two, three.

240
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,902
CHASE: I'm in the stomach.

241
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,671
There's too much blood,
I can't see.

242
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,906
Did she burst an artery?
No.

243
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,448
There. Bubbling.
Just a bad ulcer.

244
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,540
Cauterizing.

245
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,177
I can't see,
use some more saline.
Hold on.

246
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,275
Okay.

247
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,912
(EXHALES)

248
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,117
Looks good.
Bleeding ulcer. We got it.

249
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,022
(MONlTOR BEEPlNG)
She was fine two hours ago.

250
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,651
FOREMAN: Systolic BP 70.

251
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,095
Where's the ulcer?
It's brown, I cauterized it.

252
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,632
There must be
something else.

253
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,724
There.

254
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,964
FOREMAN: A second ulcer?
Not anymore. It perforated.

255
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,164
Get her to an OR!

256
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,204
The surgeons were able to
suture the perforation.

257
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,937
But the contents
of the patient's,

258
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,213
Kayla's, stomach had
spilled into her body.

259
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,872
She got septic.

260
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,248
Then the infection
lowers her blood pressure...

261
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,116
Fifty over palp
at one point.

262
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,418
It damaged her liver
and kidneys.

263
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,884
Listen, I know
this looks bad.

264
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,985
I obviously got
the diagnosis wrong,

265
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,927
but I did everything
by the book.

266
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,523
I couldn't have known
what was gonna happen.

267
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,198
If I skip my coffee,
I get cranky.
Do you want anything?

268
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,978
STACY: Why did Chase screw up?

269
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,949
He forgot to ask a question,
does there need
to be a reason?

270
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,417
It might help him.

271
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,682
As far as I'm concerned,
he made a little mistake.
It happens.

272
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,053
How far are you concerned?

273
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,785
You think I'm biased?

274
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,895
You're colleagues.
You worked together
for over a year.

275
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,226
And everyone says
you slept together.

276
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,958
Who says?

277
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,501
The correct answer is,
"We're not involved
and I'm not biased."

278
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,595
We're not involved,
and I don't know
why he messed up.

279
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,740
House has worked with him
longer than I have.

280
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,537
You should talk to House.

281
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,370
Yeah.

282
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,639
STACY: Why did Chase screw up?

283
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,282
Because he doesn't give
a crap about patients.

284
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,080
Well, he always gets
positive patient reviews.

285
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,587
Yeah. He smiles
all 84 of his teeth,

286
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,122
tells them
his tonsil story...

287
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,750
It's a nice story.
He still has his tonsils!

288
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,920
As soon as he's out
of the room, which is as soon
as he can be out of the room,

289
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,793
he starts in on
the trash talking.

290
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,356
He thinks not giving a crap
makes him like House.

291
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,527
Like it's something
to aspire to.

292
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,160
Am I gonna have to testify?

293
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,673
I won't be
encouraging them
to call you.

294
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,106
What did House say?

295
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,171
(CHUCK COUGHlNG)

296
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,983
Two months like this.

297
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,085
Let me guess, no insurance.

298
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,916
You've just heard
about the free clinic.
It's a good move.

299
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:54,483
You don't wanna skimp
on the essentials like
wristwatches, MP3 players.

300
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,619
I need to talk to you.

301
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,929
From the doorway?
It's confidential.

302
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,727
Cool. I love gossip.

303

crackling sound?

304
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,831
Like crumpling up paper?

305

Keep listening,
let me know if it changes.

306
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,109
Two questions.

307
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,677
Why did Chase screw up,
and how bad was it?

308
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,782
Wow. Talk about efficient,
I only need one answer.

309
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,191
Chase didn't screw up.
He said he did.

310
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,162
Well, I'm not a lawyer,
but that seems like
a sucky legal strategy.

311
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,893
They're gonna wanna know
what you think a reasonable
doctor would have done

312
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,956
in Chase's position.

313
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,526
If I thought he was
a reasonable doctor,
I wouldn't have hired him.

314

God, you two are
a couple of geniuses.

00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,090
Get her to an OR!

337
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,149
Let's go.

338
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,431
She was not "fine"
two hours ago.

339
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,427
Did she mention stomach pain?
Yeah, so I gave her
a stronger...

340
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,301
You didn't do an exam.
She just came in
for a follow-up.

341
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,897
The results of
the pathergy test...

342
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,565
Did you listen
to her stomach?

343
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,631
Check her vitals?

344
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,144
Maybe if she'd said
something about
taking ibuprofen,

345
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,147
mentioned
the rectal bleeding...
Yeah!

346
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,479
Why didn't she go to
med school like you did?

347
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,348
Diarrhea, blood in the stool,
these are routine questions!

348
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,717
That doctors
skip all the time!

349
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,222
It was a minor mistake,
I couldn't have known
this was gonna happen...

350
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,485
Mistakes are as serious
as the results they cause!

351
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,528
This woman could die
because you were too lazy
to ask one simple question!

352
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,496
No, she might die
because I had

353
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,531
the bad luck to spill
your damn Vicodin pills!

354
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,467
I responded
with a number of
trenchant remarks

355
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,528
which made Chase cry,
none of which
I'm gonna testify about.

356
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,006
Unless you convince
Chase to roll on me.

357
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,936
Excuse me.
Testify about what?

358
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,538
Chuck.

359
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,110
I'm gonna break
from the parable
of the wicked doctor

360
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,520
and tell a little
story about a patient,
let's call him Buck.

361
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,922
Who has low O2 sats
and crackling lung sounds.

362
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,086
Like I have.

363
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,393
Buck has idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.

364
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,759
His lung tissue's
turning to rock.

365
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,227
There's no known cause,
no treatment.

366
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,565
He is slowly suffocating.

367
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,001
You're talking about me?

368
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,633
Lung transplant's
about $500,000,

369
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,335
but this poor sucker's
got no insurance.

370
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,709
If he tried to sign up now,
he'd be excluded,
preexisting condition.

371
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,907
But let me confirm
with my lawyer.

372
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,045
She confirms.

373
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:11,122
If only Buck hadn't been
diagnosed with fibrosis
before he got insurance.

374
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,758
So, back to the exam.

375
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,934
That's how you tell
this guy he's dying?

376
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,200
Oh, relax. He's got a cold.

377
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,172
And soon, health insurance.

378
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,706
Such a hero,
always righting wrongs.

379
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,643
Who cares who
you have to manipulate?

380
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,875
I'm sorry.

381
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,646
I didn't realize
you and Buck were so close.

382
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,283
It's a point of principle.
Right.

383
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,016
It's got nothing to do
with what I did to you.

384
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,993
There's nothing
for us to talk about.

385
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,552
That's why
you're following me.

386
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,564
I read some notes.
If Chase screwed up...

387
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,863
I was wrong!
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

388
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,332
If Chase screwed up so badly,
why didn't you fire him?

389
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,803
He has great hair.

390
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,334
What are you hiding?
I'm gay.

391
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,511
Oh, that's not what you meant.
It does explain a lot, though.

392
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,844
No girlfriend,
always with Wilson.

393
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,213
Obsession with sneakers.

394
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,350
Diarrhea, blood in the stool.

395
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,286
Two simple questions
you could have asked
her six months ago

396
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,551
and averted this whole thing.

397
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,820
You didn't ask either, why?

398
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,793
Judging from your question
and your demeanor,

399
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,496
I assume you were
visiting with House.

400
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,931
We've been over this.
I don't know.

401
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,231
Good doctors don't
make mistakes like that.

402
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,204
Good doctors never forget
to ask questions?

403
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,503
Then you've got your answer,
apparently,
I'm not a good doctor.

404
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,442
FYl, self-pity generally
is not a good strategy
in these hearings.

405
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,638
What happened
after the operation?

406
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,108
The kidney damage
isn't so bad.

407
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,013
The liver damage
is more worrisome.

408
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,882
There's no dialysis
for livers.

409
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:49,943
I know.

410
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,320
But if she loses a liver,
she can get a transplant,
right?

411
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,222
We can put her on a list.

412
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,422
I could do it.

413
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,422
I could give her
part of my liver.

414
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,465
Surgeons won't operate
unless the donor's

415
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,567
had a long time to
weigh the decision.

416
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,760
There's black markets.

417
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,062
For organs?

418
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,162
(KAYLA GROANlNG)
That's just...

419
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,900
Oh, my stomach!

420
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,169
The pain constant?
Yeah!

421
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,438
Sharp or dull?
I don't know!

422
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,106
It's ferric.
It's a little cold.

423
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,116
She's got ascites.
No. It's a clot.

424
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,583
Nurse! Call the OR.

425
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,950
We gotta prep her
for an embolectomy.

426
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,352
(GROANlNG)

427
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,983
Run CBC, PT,
and a liver panel.

428
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,623
Sepsis had lowered
her BP so much, she got
clots in her liver.

429
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,221
They blocked
the hepatic artery,
cut off the blood flow.

430
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,629
Her liver was shocked.

431
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,533
And Cuddy listed her?
With all the other problems?

432
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,598
Forget it!
We can't give a liver
to a woman this sick.

433
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,039
Do you listen to
what you're saying?

434
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:48,068
There is no point in giving
a new liver to somebody
who also has vasculitis.

435
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,273
Treatable.
And kidney damage.

436
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,045
It's healing.
You know what's
really killing her?

437
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,019
Chase forgot to ask
a standard question
about stomach pain.

438
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,556
So he missed the diagnosis,
so she perforated,

439
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,888
so she got sepsis,
so her BP tanked,

440
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,290
so she got blood clots,
so she lost her liver.

441
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,194
Livers are important, Cuddy.
You can't live without them,
hence the name.

442
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,392
Here's the big issue.

443
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,267
Chase is a hospital employee,
and Kayla is
a sympathetic mother

444
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,500
of those two
jury-friendly moppets,
Caleb and Cody.

445
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,867
Dory and Nikki.

446
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:21,003
Your point, beyond
just trying to make
Chase wet himself,

447
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,742
seems to be that
the hospital faces
liability here.

448
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,974
Well, thanks for
clearing that up.

449
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,849
I still need
a medical reason
to list her.

450
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,818
That is the medical reason.

451
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,349
If the family wins
this hospital in a lawsuit,
they'll turn it into condos.

452
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,794
And people will die
waiting outside a condo
for medical care.

453
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,263
Start praying
for a 1 2-car pileup
on the turnpike,

454
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,365
'cause we're not exactly
swimming in livers over here.

455
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,777
When you're testifying,
skip the details on
how House convinced Cuddy.

456
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,149
I don't think the people
who got bumped down
the transplant list

457
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,209
need to know why.

458
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,277
It didn't matter anyway.

459
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,690
SAM: She next on the list?
Yes.

460
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,023
But she's AB negative,
very rare.

461
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,123
SAM: How long can she
go on like this?

462
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,197
Probably another day or two.

463
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,098
I'm donating my liver.
Sam, we talked about this.

464
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,208
I'm a perfect match,
six out of six HLA proteins.

465
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,941
How'd you get
checked out so fast?

466
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,479
I know a guy in
medical testing,
and I paid him to rush it.

467
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,516
Sam bribed someone
to rush his tests?
Wouldn't you?

468
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,447
Someone's going to get
the blame for what happened,

469
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,918
so the more we
spread it around,
we might as well...

470
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:40,151
You said no surgeon would do
a live donor transplant
on such short notice.

471
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,386
House took care of that, too.

472
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,431
Your patient's
hardly clotting.

473
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,328
Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh
frozen plasma pre-op.

474
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,495
Pretty risky.

475
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,096
Well, that's why I came
to the best transplant
surgeon in the hospital.

476
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,800
She's dead without you.

477
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,673
Get her in this afternoon.

478
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,641
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.

479
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,580
And this was right
before you ran the marathon,
I suppose?

480
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,621
Was it the part
where he warmly clasped
my hands in thanks,

481
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,678
was that too much?

482
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,781
What did you do to him?

483
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,588
The hospital lawyer asks me
if I did something unethical?

484
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,094
If I did,
the last person I'd tell
is the hospital lawyer,

485
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,688
especially since she's gone
all Old Testament on me.

486
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,165
You'll tell me.

487
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,733
Oh. Okay then.

488
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,567
One caveat,
I've moved past threesomes,
I'm now into foursomes.

489
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,471
If someone backs out, then,
you've still got a threesome.

490
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,068
And if two people back out,
you're still having sex.

491
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,545
You'd be amazed,
even if three people...

492
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,548
Anything you say
is attorney-client.

493
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,811
So you can get advice
about the bad,
bad thing you did,

494
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,854
knowing I'll be tortured
because I can't tell a soul.

495
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,250
Actually,
it is kind of cool.

496
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:50,092
Are you completely
out of your mind?

497
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,826
She's dying on her own,

498
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,627
why would I volunteer
to be her executioner?

499
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:58,529
And I'd just be inviting
a lawsuit from the brother
no matter what.

500
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,031
5 grand.

501
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:05,502
And that's just ante money.
After the surgery,
you get another 15.

502
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,045
Though I warn you,
that includes the tip.

503
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,205
(LAUGHlNG)

504
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,006
I make 600 grand a year.

505
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,541
You think I'm gonna risk
tanking my percentages
for $20,000?

506
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,249
It's tax-free.

507
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,819
For the record,

508
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,889
I hope the Department
takes you and Chase

509
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,951
and drop-kicks
both your asses
out the back door.

510
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,119
Great!

511
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,425
That means
I don't have to bother
welshing on the 15 grand

512
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,162
I would have owed you.

513
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,737
If you don't do the surgery,
I'm gonna tell your wife

514
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,639
that you've been sleeping
with a series of nurses.

515
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,735
Currently Nurse Cutler
in Radiology.

516
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,108
Now, what's 600 grand
divided by two?

517
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,216
Last Christmas party,

518
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,253
Nurse Cutler handed you
one of those little hot dogs.

519
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,412
And you didn't thank her.

520
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,955
Well, that only happens
when you're very,
very intimate.

521
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,128
That, and the fact
that you've been
practically dancing around

522
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,723
with your zipper open,
and a used condom
stuck on your shoe.

523
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,132
Your wife is apparently
the only one who doesn't know.

524
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,567
There's no way
you'll tell her.

525
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,069
Of course I won't.

526
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,696
I'm much too cowardly.

527
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,135
No, I'll just send
an anonymous letter.

528
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:15,305
Now, I've got an OR booked
for 4:00 this afternoon.

529
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,406
Are you free?

530
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,718
Oh, and "for the record,"

531
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,083
you are the worst
transplant surgeon
in this hospital.

532
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:31,254
But unfortunately, you're
the only one who's currently
cheating on his wife.

533
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,435
You bribed him
and then you blackmailed him?

534
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,497
She'd have been dead
in two days if I hadn't made
Ayersman do the surgery.

535
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,805
Leave the blackmail
out of the story
you tell the committee.

536
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,004
I tried to leave it out
of the story I told you.

537
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,604
And then there was
that incident
in the parking lot.

538
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,980
Don't do that!
Hey, what, are you nuts?

539
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,043
No, please,
I didn't do it!

540
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,714
I didn't do anything! Please!
No!

541
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,781
Apparently,
someone sent an anonymous
letter to his wife.

542
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,761
You blackmailed Ayersman,
he performed the surgery,
and you ratted him out anyway?

543
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,921
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

544
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,862
You just can't
control yourself, can you?

545
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,060
No matter how stupid,
how self-destructive...

546
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,036
To make this
conversation easier,
can we discard the fiction

547
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,437
that we're talking about
anything other than
what I did to you?

548
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,272
You're not mad because
I broke into your
psychiatrist's office.

549
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,538
Yeah, I was
thrilled about that.

550
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,873
Okay, it was
a lousy thing to do.

551
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,936
But if what I had found

552
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,380
was that everything was
all kittens and moonbeams
in Markville,

553
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,782
you'd be over it.
No, I wouldn't!

554
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,411
You're mad at me
for letting you
know what I did.

555
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,979
Because you liked
where things were going.

556
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,620
And for that,
I actually am sorry.

557
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,391
It was stupid.

558
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,361
(SlGHS)

559
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,808
Let me tell you
a story about a patient.

560
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,437
A patient we'll call Fusan.

561
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,745
CHASE: Because Sam had
rushed his tests,

562
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,810
we were able to
get them into surgery
that afternoon.

563
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,015
Dr. Ayersman performed
the live-donor transplant.

564
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,787
He resected the right lobe,
hepatic vein,

565
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,123
and hepatic artery
of Sam 's liver,

566
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,188
and transplanted it
into Kayla.

567
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,096
The operation was a success.

568
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,565
Kayla and Sam continued
to receive routine care.

569
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,706
Two months later,

570
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,899
she came by for an exam.

571
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,567
July 24, be precise.

572
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,036
You did the exam?

573
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,512
Honestly, I just wanted...
"Honestly"?

574
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,048
So you've been
lying up until now?

575
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,346
Let's make a deal.
I won't use
the word "honestly,"

576
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,079
and you'll quit
stopping by to see House

577
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,915
so you don't take it
out on me afterwards.

578
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,285
How about that?

579
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,191
I wanted to be as far away
from Kayla as possible.

580
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,360
And House was
rubbing my nose in it.

581
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,897
How are the girls?

582
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,522
They're great.

583
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:53,195
Dory had her first crush,
which was cute.
Oh, yeah?

584
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,372
And then her
first sort of breakup,

585
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,237
(BEEPlNG)
which was not so cute.

586
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,077
You're hot. 99.3.

587
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,339
Have you been coughing?
No.

588
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,442
Pain in urinating?
No.

589
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,288
99's not that high, is it?

590
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,518
Immunosuppressants
block fevers,

591
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,025
you shouldn't
have one at all.

592
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,597
I'm sending a nurse in here
to draw cultures.

593
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,695
And I'm ordering
a chest x-ray.

594
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,798
I wasn't making
any more mistakes.

595
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,064
Another phrase to avoid
in front of the committee.

596
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,197
She spiked a fever
an hour later.

597
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:32,835
Her AST and ALT are up.
She's rejecting the liver.

598
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,708
No, it's just an infection.

599
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,679
One of her cultures
is growing out strep.

600
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,215
Just one?
Probably a contaminant.

601
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,047
She's dehydrated,
her hematocrit's way up.
It's strep.

602
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,484
Her transaminases
are up, too.

603
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,647
That's just
stress from the strep.
Jeez, Chase.

604
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,021
You and this strep.
Get a room already.

605
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,026
She's not rejecting
the liver.

606
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,294
It's just an infection,
she'll be fine.

607
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,887
CAMERON: Worst case,
we could re-list her.

608
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,398
You House?

609
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,966
Well, that depends.

610
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,765
Are you gonna hit Dr. House?

611
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,432
You haven't even seen
my sister, and you're being
cute with me?

612
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,908
Sam, we're talking
about her right now.

613
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,237
Her fever might...
Could be hep B,
hep C, right?

614
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,805
This is treatable.
You give her interferon,
she's okay, right?

615
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,611
You know a lot
about hepatitis.

616
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,846
He just donated his liver.

617
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,187
You're flushed. You sick?

618
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,226
I'm tired.
You're hiding the fact
that you're sick.

619
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,989
Now, why would you do that?
Hey, what are you...

620
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,621
Now, either you
specifically asked

621
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,360
for a tattoo of a heart
that's been left out
in the sun too long,

622
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,561
or that is
a really bad home job.

623
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:35,163
It's a very common
way of getting hep C.
Which you have.

624
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,207
And you've had it
a long time.

625
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,240
It was gonna keep me
from giving my liver.

626
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,407
You paid off that lab tech
to say you were clean?

627
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,781
It hasn't been active
in years, she was
gonna die if I didn't.

628
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,319
You paid someone off?

629
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,944
That is
totally unethical!

630
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,684
Get an MRl for him
and his sister, right now.

631
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,588
She got hep from me,
didn't she?

632
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,290
No! No, no, no, no.
God, no.

633
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,690
I think she got
cancer from you.

634
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,635
House was right?

635
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,801
The brother had
an undiagnosed hepatoma

636
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,868
that was transplanted
with his liver.

637
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,673
It grew a lot faster
in Kayla because she was
immunosuppressed.

638
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,681
How could House
have known?

639
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,650
Hepatitis can cause
liver cancer.

640
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,315
Plus, her hematocrit,
red blood cell count,
was high.

641
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,449
Usually means dehydration.

642
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,495
Rare cases, cancer.

643
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,031
It probably saved
Sam's life.

644
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,330
CHASE: We were able to
operate on him early enough,
before it metastasized.

645
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,097
SURGEON: O2 sats 94.

646
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,603
Kayla had already
started rejecting the liver.

647
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,805
And you couldn't re-list her
because of the cancer.
Nothing we could do.

648
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,612
This is good.

649
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,182
The brother lying
about his hep,
it's an intervening act.

650
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,685
The proximate
cause of her cancer,
not your mistake.

651
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,847
She would have died
six months ago if he hadn't
given up his liver.

652
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,515
Maybe. Can't prove it.

653
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,889
(PAGER BEEPlNG)

654
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,191
You need to come with me.

655
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,855
Just been served with papers.

656
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,590
Actually, paper.
One page.

they're suing?

You think people
love Chase so much
they're gonna just forgo...

Punitive damages
in the amount of
$10 million.

663
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,581
Punitives? That means
they're alleging
gross negligence.

664
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,484
Their lawyer's obviously
out of his mind.

he's not crazy.

Oh, no.
I've been sued by him.

667
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,928
You have been hiding things
and lying to me all day.

668
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,758
I haven't lied
about anything.

669
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,425
Except for the parts that
I admitted I was lying about.

670
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,401
And I'm not the one
being sued. I feel funny.

671
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,098
Well,
what haven't you told us?

672
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,504
(SlGHS)

673
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,018
Before she checked out,
Sam found her a second liver.

674
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,851
She had cancer,
how could she...
Black market.

675
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,682
There's a doctor
in Mexico City who was gonna
do the surgery.

676
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,694
She's leaving
from JFK at 5:00.

677
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,889
To meet some Mexican guy
in the back of a van

678
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,488
with a pig's liver
and a hacksaw?
This is nuts!

679
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,089
You wanna
rat me out to House?

680
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,567
He'll say if there's a chance
in a billion then go for it.

681
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,160
This is not what she wants.

682
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,830
She's being manipulated

683
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:25,103
by a morally guilty brother
and a legally guiltier doctor.

684
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,734
You think
she wants to die?

685
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,436
She's dying either way.

686
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:30,970
Chase!

687
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,814
How many people you know
walking around with
a black market organ

688
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,319
from a Third World
surgeon, huh?

689
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,548
This isn't gonna be
your salvation.

690
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,250
It's just one more thing
they'll pin on you.

691
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,494
Go in there,
be the good guy.

692
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,931
We need to talk.

693
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,400
No, there's no time.

694
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,630
Two minutes.

695
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,431
Kayla.

696
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,840
I made a mistake.

697
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,338
I wasn't as blunt
as I should have been
about your odds.

698
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,511
I probably didn't
want to face them myself.

699
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,480
Dr. Chase,
please don't do this.

700
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:11,386
The stress of the travel,
the operation
and even then the cancer...

701
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,286
Kayla, we're going!
My dad died.

702
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,453
Lung cancer.

703
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,620
I saw him a couple of months
before it happened.

704
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,856
We never talked about it.

705
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,922
I'm sorry your father died,
but it has nothing...

706
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,127
He never even told me
he was sick.

707
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,468
I wish he had.

708
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,798
It would...

709
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,670
You're gonna die. Alone.

710
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,611
Thousands of miles
from your children.

711
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,613
You don't wanna
do that to them.

712
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,581
Kayla...

713
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,715
I'm sorry, Sam.

714
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,264
Kayla, you can't give up.

715
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,834
If you do this,

716
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,571
if you go home,

717
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,200
I killed you.

718
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,673
No.

719
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,379
You gave me
three months.

720
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,286
You gave Dory and Nikki
three more months with me.

721
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,793
And when they
found my cancer,

722
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,128
they found yours.

723
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,031
And I got to save
my baby brother.

724
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,303
(SOBBlNG)

725
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,380
CHASE: A week later,
Kayla died at home.

726
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,978
Sam was furious.

727
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,989
Gotta be why the big lawsuit.

728
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,649
Are you buying this?
STACY: Of course not!

729
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,057
There was no
illegal transplant,
there's no causation.

730
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,823
He was ready to kill me.

731
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,857
Maybe he's lying
to his lawyers.

732
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,625
Or you're lying to us.

733
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,998
Last Thursday he saw you
for post-op care.
If you hate your doctor,

734
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,868
you find another doctor
before you find a lawyer.

735
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,441
This guy didn't sue
Cameron or Foreman,
he didn't even sue House!

736
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,875
There's something
personal here,

737
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,073
something you don't
want us to know
before your hearing.

738
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:21,275
The guy didn't hate you
before that meeting,
he hated you after.

739
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,218
So, how's
everything else?

740
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,154
The girls?
Oh, you know.

741
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,058
A lot of crying,
some nightmares.

742
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,226
We'll be okay, though.

743
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,792
Good.

744
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,062
Girls are not gonna be happy
about leaving town, though.

745
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,799
They love that house,

746
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,472
the yard, their friends.

747
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,874
You're moving?
Yeah.

748
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,742
Ever since the operation,
I've been on disability,

749
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,011
and the mortgage...

750
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,482
So, we're moving out of state,
somewhere cheaper.

751
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,782
Anyways, thanks.

752
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,452
I killed your sister.

753
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,996
I misdiagnosed her ulcer.

754
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,795
It killed her.

755
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,130
Shut up, man.

756
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,939
She liked you, just...

757
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,805
I was hung over
when she came back
to see me.

758
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,936
I'd been up half
the night drinking,
had a headache,

759
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,743
and I just wanted to
get the hell out of there.

760
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:31,688
I couldn't care less
what your sister was saying
about her stomach pain.

761
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,247
(CRASHlNG)

762
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,206
May I speak to my future
former employee?

763
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:51,734
HOUSE: Great story.

764
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,676
CHASE: You think I'm lying?

765
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,109
That's exactly
what I told him.

766
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,645
I'm sure it is.

767
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,715
But you lied to him.
You want him to sue you.

768
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,513
I killed his sister.

769
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,587
I ordered black coffee
this morning and got cream.

770
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:08,216
Everybody screws up.
They didn't put poison
in your coffee.

771
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,919
I've seen you hung over.

772
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,189
You weren't the day you blew
his sister's diagnosis.

773
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,323
What does it matter why?
Is she less dead
if I have a good excuse?

774
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,527
If I thought you'd screwed up
because you were drunk,
I would have fired you.

775
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,663
You knew?
You were depressed
and distracted.

776
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,235
I assumed you'd
gotten a phone call
from your stepmom.

777
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,976
This is Robert.

778
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,187
What did he die of?

779
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,524
That's impossible.

780
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,964
I saw him two months ago.
If he had lung cancer,
he would have...

781
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,307
Dr. Chase?

782
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:21,092
Good news is,
both your parents
are dead now.

783
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,464
So no reason to
screw up this bad again.
How'd you know?

784
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,935
There's this interconnected
network of computers,

785
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,734
or "lnterweb,"
where you can...

786
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,603
How did you know to look?

787
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,871
When he visited,
he told me he only had
two months left.

788
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,816
When you screwed up,
I did the math.

789
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,579
Why didn't you tell me
he was dying?

790
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,414
He asked me not to.

791
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,549
So you just
hung me out there
to be blindsided?

792
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,655
Yeah, Chase,
it was all my fault.

793
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,625
Look, you've got a choice.
You can either tell the truth,

794
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,932
the hospital settles,
the family gets some money.

795
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,404
They get to keep their house.

796
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,308
Or you can keep up this lie.

797
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,372
The family gets
punitive damages,

798
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,004
they buy a jet,
and they move to Park Avenue,

799
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,909
and you have to
find another career.

800
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,781
You're not gonna
say anything?

801
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,717
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

802
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:24,025
Legally, it's better for me
if you go down in flames.

803
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,507
Is Chase telling
the committee about his dad?

804
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,383
I don't know.

805
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,142
(SlGHS)

806
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,121
I thought you were gonna
get him to sell me out.

807
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,923
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?

808
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,990
You're my client, too.

809
00:39:58,829 --> 00:39:59,818
Yeah.

810
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,997
And that's not gonna change
unless you leave this job,

811
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,795
or I do.

812
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,668
So how do you deal
with a coworker that
you have feelings for?

813
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,538
Positive or negative.

814
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,038
I don't wanna
end up like Chase.

815
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:21,911
I don't wanna get
emotionally caught up
and kill you.

816
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,918
It's not all negative.

817
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,307
Maybe you were right,
maybe...

818
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,037
Maybe that is the problem.

819
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,353
So what do we do?

820
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,229
I don't know.

821
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,298
DR. SCHlSGAL: Dr. House?

822
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,345
After considering
the testimonial and
documentary evidence,

823
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:30,353
this ad-hoc committee in
the matter of Kayla McGinley
has reached a decision.

824
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,683
Dr. Chase,

825
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,215
your error resulted
in a patient's death.

826
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:39,020
You also lied,
both to your superiors
and the patient's brother.

827
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,528
But, taking into account
the mitigating factor
of your father's death,

828
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,126
we've decided not to
revoke your privileges.

829
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:50,930
You'll receive one week's
suspension, and a letter
in your permanent file.

830
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,233
Now, as for Dr. House.

831
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,870
There is no evidence
of a failure to supervise

832
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,312
that would lead to
disciplinary action.

833
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:03,551
And yet, there is enough
in the record to be
very troubled by your conduct,

834
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:08,557
including certain allegations
of blackmail from members
of the transplant team,

835
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:12,118
and by your general refusal
to meet with your patients.

836
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,894
It should be noted
that your patient's cancer

837
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,798
was diagnosed
as a result of a direct
physical examination...

838
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,962
Not of the patient.
I met the brother,
never met her.

839
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,938
Do you want me to
go to a family reunion

840
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,973
every time
I take on a patient?

841
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,073
The committee has
determined that
for no less than one month,

842
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,308
Dr. House will have
his practice supervised
by another doctor,

843
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,850
to be designated
by Dr. Cuddy.

844
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,113
This proceeding is adjourned.

845
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,894
Did you know this was coming?

846
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,664
They contacted me
about an hour ago.

847
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,569
CAMERON:
What's happening to Chase?

848
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,274
Now you're fired!

849
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,876
No. He's not.

850
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,070
Dr. House,

851
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,480
meet your new boss.

852
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,624
Guess I'm his best friend now.
