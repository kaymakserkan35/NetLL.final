# don't you cry no more #

5
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:21,027
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities,

6
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:24,329
And play the roles
that destiny has chosen for you.

7
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:25,497
You're <i>the</i> vessel.
Michael's vessel.

8
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:26,932
The answer's no.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,433
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

10
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:30,235
You're the one, Sam.
You're my vessel.

11
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:31,336
That'll never happen.

12
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:34,239
# Ahh, Ahh, Ahh #

13
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:37,909
# once I rose above
the noise and confusion #

14
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:39,944
Hi, Lisa. Things are
about to get really bad.

15
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:41,379
Lisa: Whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't do it.

16
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:42,479
I have to.

17
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:44,048
Gabriel: <i>The cage</i> <i>you 
sprung Lucifer from...</i>

18
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:45,683
<i>you can shove his ass back in.</i>

19
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,920
<i>The key to the cage...</i>
<i>four rings from the Horsemen.</i>

20
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:50,688
- Bobby: Who is it?
- That's our brother.

21
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:52,590
- What do you mean Adam is gone?
- Castiel: The angels took him.

22
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:54,190
Maybe they're moving on
from you, Dean.

23
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:56,299
- Think Adam's okay?
- Adam: No.

24
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:57,727
Doubt it.

25
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:00,163
# I hear the voices

26
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,666
What if <i>you</i> guys lead the devil
to the edge and <i>I</i> jump in?

27
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:04,768
Are you idjits

Death: You're going to
let your brother

30
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:12,541
jump right into that fiery pit.

31
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,109
What exactly are you afraid of?

32
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,343
Losing?

33
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,612
Or losing your brother?

Chuck: <i>On April 21, 1967,</i>

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,792
<i>The 100 millionth GM vehicle</i>
<i>rolled off the line</i>

37
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,760

38
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:35,529
<i>A blue two-door Caprice.</i>

39
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,565
<i>There was a big ceremony,</i>

40
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:41,368
<i>The lieutenant governor</i>
<i>even showed up.</i>

41
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:44,805
<i>Three days later, another car</i>
<i>rolled off that same line.</i>

42
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,373
<i>No one gave two craps</i>
<i>about her.</i>

43
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,043
But they should have.

44
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,846
<i>Because,</i>
<i>this 1967 Chevrolet Impala</i>

45
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:55,482
<i>would turn out to be</i>
<i>the most important car...</i>

46
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:59,752
No, the most important <i>object...</i>

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,621
in pretty much
the whole universe.

48
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,091
<i>She was first owned</i>
<i>by Sal Moriarty,</i>

49
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:09,261
<i>an alcoholic with two ex-wives</i>
<i>and three blocked arteries.</i>

50
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,198

<i>Sam and Dean</i>

54
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,740

55
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:25,777

<i>I guess that's where</i>
<i>this story begins.</i>

60
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,359
And here's where it ends.

61
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,200
Hey.

00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:03,611
What's going on?

67
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:06,682
I'm in.

[cap rattles]

69
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:10,618
In with...?

70
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:12,788
The whole
"up with Satan" thing.

71
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:14,723
I'm on board.

72
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:17,825
You're gonna let me say yes?

73
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,360
No. That's the thing.

74
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:23,230
It's not on me
to <i>let</i> you do anything.

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,335
You're a grown...
well, <i>overgrown...</i> man.

76
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:32,972
If this is what you want,
I'll back your play.

77
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:36,142
That's the last thing
I thought you'd ever say.

78
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,210
Might be.

00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:40,446
I'm not gonna lie to you, though...

81
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,216
it goes against
every fiber I got.

82
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,553
I mean, truth is...

84
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:57,930
It's kinda been my job, you know?

85
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:00,432
But more than that, it's...

86
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:02,267
it's kinda who I am.

87
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:05,237
You're not a kid anymore, Sam...

88
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:07,105

treating you like one.

Maybe <i>I</i> got to grow up
a little, too.

I don't know if we got
a snowball's chance.

91

But...

92

that if anybody can do it...

00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,858
it's you.

I got to put him back in.

100
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,683
Okay.

So, was I right?

Not really.

115

What do you got?

116
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:04,015
Not much.
These look like omens to you?

Wait. What about Detroit?

120
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,089
Temp's dropped
about 20 degrees,

121
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:13,725
but only in a five-block radius
of downtown Motown.

122
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,959
That's the one.

123
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,727
Devil's in Detroit.

124
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,828
Really?

125
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,629
As far as foreboding goes,

126
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,298
it's a little light
in the loafers.

127
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:22,299
You sure?

128
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,368
Yeah, I'm sure.

129
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:42,084
Aw. Ain't he
a little angel?

130
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,023
Angels don't sleep.

131
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,867
Sam, I got a bad feeling
about this.

132
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,936
Well, you'd be nuts
to have a <i>good</i> feeling about it.

133
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,271
You know what I mean.

Here we are.

138
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,912
Maybe this is him rolling out
the red carpet, you know?

139
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,479
Maybe he knows something
that we don't.

140
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:15,016
[laughing] Dean, I'm sure
he knows a <i>butt-load</i> we don't.

141
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,918
We just got to hope
he doesn't know about the rings.

Hey, um...

145
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,162
On the subject, there's something
I got to talk to you about.

146
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,163
What?

147
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:33,333
This thing goes our way

148
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:36,001
and I... triple Lindy
into that box...

149
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,439
y-you know
I'm not coming back.

150
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:43,642
Yeah, I'm aware.

151
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:47,079
So you got to
promise me something.

152
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:49,214
Okay. Yeah, anything.

153
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:54,284
You got to promise
not to try to bring me back.

154
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:56,520
What?

155
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:58,556
No, I didn't sign up for that.

156
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:00,091
Dean...

157
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:01,692
Your hell is gonna make my tour
look like Graceland.

158
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,761
Y-you want me just to sit by
and do nothing?

159
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:06,029
Once the cage is shut,
you <i>can't</i> go poking at it, Dean.

160
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:08,730
- It's too risky.
- No, no, no, no, no.

161
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,366
As if I'm just gonna
let you rot in there.

162
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:10,834
Yeah, you are.
You don't have a choice.

163
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:11,969
You can't ask me to do this.

164
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:14,170
I'm sorry, Dean.
You <i>have</i> to.

165
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,908
So then what am I
supposed to do?

166
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,445
You go find Lisa.
[scoffs]

167
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:23,446
You pray to God she's
dumb enough to take you in,

168
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:27,616
and you... you have barbecues
and go to football games.

169
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:30,853
You go live some normal,
apple-pie life, Dean.

170
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,556
Promise me.

171
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:54,609
Bobby: Demons.

172
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,443
At least two dozen of them.

173
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:57,911
You were right... something's up.

174
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,813
More than something.

175
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,382
He's here, I know it.

176
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,457
[sighs]

177
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:16,529
[sighs]

178
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,202
I'll see ya around, kid.

179
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,670
See ya around.

180
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:37,249
He gets in...

181
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:39,851
you fight him tooth and nail,
you understand?

182
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,521
Keep swingin', don't give an inch.

183
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,754
Yes, sir.

184
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,492
[sighs heavily]

185
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,167
You take care of these guys, okay?

186
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,936
[sighs lightly]
That's not possible.

187
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:03,739
[chuckles]

188
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:05,975
Then humor me.

189
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:08,077
Oh, I was supposed to lie.

190
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:09,411
[chuckles]

191
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,613
Uh...

192
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:13,748
Sure. They'll be fine. I...

193
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,750
Just...
just stop... talking.

194
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,322
[sighs]

195
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,701
You mind not watching this?

196
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,848
[breathing heavily]

197
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,420
Okay.

198
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:55,054
Let's go.

199
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,231
All right!

200
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,633
We're here,
you sons of bitches!

201
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,801
Come and get it!

202
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,939
Hey, guys.

203
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,441
Is your father home?

204
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,277
[grunting]

205
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,218
Hey, guys.

206
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:30,020
So nice of you to drop in.

207
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,130
Chuck:
<i>The Impala, of course,</i>

208
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,098
<i>has all the things</i>
<i>other cars have...</i>

209
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,033
<i>and a few things they</i> don't.

210
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:46,936
<i>But none of that stuff's</i>
<i>important.</i>

211
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:50,606
<i>This</i> is the stuff
that's important.

212
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,608
<i>The army man that Sam</i>
<i>crammed in the ashtray...</i>

213
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:54,644
<i>it's still stuck there.</i>

214
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:57,112
<i>The legos that Dean shoved</i>
<i>into the vents...</i>

215
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,281
<i>to this day, heat comes on</i>
<i>and they can hear 'em rattle.</i>

216
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,284
<i>These are the things</i>
<i>that make the car theirs...</i>

217
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,754
really <i>theirs.</i>

218
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:08,056
<i>Even when Dean rebuilt her</i>
<i>from the ground up,</i>

219
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,892
<i>he made sure</i>
<i>all these little things stayed,</i>

220
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,294
<i>'cause it's the blemishes</i>
<i>that make her beautiful.</i>

221
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,065
<i>The devil doesn't know or care</i>

222
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:19,133
<i>what kind of car</i>
<i>the boys drive.</i>

223
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:23,271
Sorry if it's a bit chilly.

224
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,374
Most people think I burn hot.

225
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,010
It's actually quite the opposite.

226
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,644
Well, I'll alert the media.

227
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:40,120
Help me understand something,
guys.

228
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:41,921
I mean, stomping through
my front door

229
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,892
is... a tad suicidal,
don't you think?

230
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,594
We're not here to fight you.

231
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:48,794
No?

232
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:51,962
- Then why are you?
- I want to say "yes."

233
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,932
Excuse me?

234
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,269
[inhales sharply]

235
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,909
Chock-full of Ovaltine, are we?

236
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:05,510
You heard me.

237
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,511
Yes.

238
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,613
You're serious.

239
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,419
Look, judgment day's
a runaway train.

240
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,321
We get it now,
we just want off.

241
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:17,322
Meaning?

242
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,991
Deal of the century.

243
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,792
I give you a free ride,
but when it's all over,

244
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,562
I live, he lives,
you bring our parents back...

245
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,564
Okay, can we please
drop the Telenovela?

246
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,001
I know you have the rings, Sam.

247
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,206
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

248
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:42,111
The Horsemen's rings?

249
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,548
The magic keys to my cage?

250
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,518
Ring a bell?

251
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,920
Come on, Sam.
I've never lied to you.

252
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,522
You could at least
pay me the same respect.

253
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:58,060
It's okay. I'm not mad.

254
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,828
A wrestling match
inside your noggin...

255
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,997
I like the idea.

256
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:07,602
Just you and me,
one round, no tricks.

257
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,337
You win, you jump in the hole.

258
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,173
<i>I</i> win...

259
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,008
well, then I win.

260
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:17,545
What do you say, Sam?

261
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,813
A fiddle of gold
against your soul

262
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,915
[singsong voice]
says I'm better than you-ou.

263
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,188
So he knows.
Doesn't change anything.

264
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:29,989
Sam.

265
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,724
- We don't have any other choice.
- No.

266
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,229
Yes.

267
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:59,117
[chants prayer]

268
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,888
[rumbling, plaster cracking]

269
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:16,533
Sammy!

270
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:18,235
- Dean!
- Sammy!

271
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:19,269
[groans]

272
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:22,005
I can feel him.

273
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:23,607
- Oh, God!
- You got to go now!

274
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,907
Come on!

275
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:27,810
[groans]

276
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,112
Go now, Sammy.

277
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,813
Now!

278
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:35,584
[panting]

279
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,800
I was just messing with you.

280
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,970
Sammy's long gone.

281
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:04,878
[chants prayer]

282
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:06,513
[rumbling stops]

283
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,770
I told you...

284
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,640
this would always happen
in Detroit.

285
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,336
Sam.

286
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,503
Come on.

287
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:08,705
[sighs]

288
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,873
I can feel you...

289
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:13,108
scratching away in there.

290
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,914
Look...

291
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:22,083
I'll take the gag off, okay?

292
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,290
You got me all wrong, kiddo.

293
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:30,924
[panting]

294
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,293
I'm not the bad guy here.

295
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:34,962
I'm gonna rip you apart
from the inside out.

296
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,597
Do you understand me?

297
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:38,766
[sighs]

298
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,135
Such anger...

299
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:42,737
young Skywalker.

300
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:48,808
Who are you <i>really</i>
<i>angry with?</i>

301
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,543
Me?

302
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,279
Or that face in the mirror?

303
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:54,781
I'm sure this is all
a big joke to you, huh?

304
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:55,882
Not at all.

305
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,550
I've been waiting for you...

306
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:02,053
for a long, <i>long</i> time.

307
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:04,089
Come on, Sam.

308
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:06,057
You have to admit...

309
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,827
you can feel it, right?

310
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:11,428
- What?
- The exhilaration.

311
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,532
And you know why that is?

312
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,668
Because we're two halves
made whole.

313
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:18,269
M.F.E.O.

314
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,537
Literally.

315
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:22,640
This feels
pretty damn far from good.

316
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,777
I'm inside
your grapefruit, Sam.

317
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:29,046
You can't lie to me.

318
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,981
I see it all.

319
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,950
How odd you always felt,

320
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:38,021
how... out of place

321
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,457
in that... family of yours.

322
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,994
And why shouldn't you have?

323
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:47,163
They were foster care... at best.

324
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:49,665
<i>I'm</i> your real family.

325
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,334
No, that's not true.

326
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,301
It is.

327
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,338
And I know you know it.

328
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:58,173
All those times you ran away,

329
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:00,108
you weren't running
from <i>them.</i>

330
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,610
You were running
towards <i>me.</i>

331
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,981
[sighs]

332
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,883
This doesn't have to be
a bad thing, you know.

333
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:10,017
[scoffs]

334
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:12,454
I let Dean live, didn't I?

335
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:13,988
I <i>want</i> him to live.

336
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:16,458
I'll bring your folks
back, too.

337
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:20,494
I want you to be happy, Sam.

338
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:23,731
I don't want <i>anything</i>
<i>from you...</i>

339
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,165
[chuckles]

340
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,200
Really?

341
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,771
Not even a little payback?

342
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,373
What's that supposed to mean?

343
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,408
Look closely.

344
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:39,011
None of these little devils
look familiar to you?

345
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,818
That's Mr. Bensman.

346
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,353
One of my grade-school teachers.

347
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:50,623
And that's your friend Doug
from that time in East Lansing.

348
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,092
And Rachel...

349
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,660
your prom date.

350
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,865
Sam Winchester,
this is your life.

351
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,566
Azazel's gang...

352
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:05,136
watching you since
you were a rug-rat.

353
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,873
Jerking you around
like a dog on a leash.

354
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,775
[exhales heavily]

355
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,510
I know how you feel about them.

356
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,478
Me too.

357
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,048
So, what do you say you and I

363
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:33,863
It's starting.

364
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:36,165
Yeah, you think, genius?

365
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,501
You don't have to be mean.

366
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,135
So what do we do now?

367
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:47,509
I suggest we imbibe
copious quantities of alcohol.

368
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,511
Just wait for the
inevitable blast wave.

369
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:50,979
Yeah, swell.
Thank you, Bukowski.

370
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,247
I-I mean,
how do we stop it?

371
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:57,217
We don't.

372
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:02,490
Lucifer <i>will</i> meet Michael

374

Okay, well,
where's this chosen field?

375
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:07,962
I don't know.

376
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:10,865
Well, there's got to be
something that we can do.

377
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,533
I'm sorry, Dean.
This is over.

378

There was never much hope
to begin with.

383

Oh, uh, Dean.

00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:16,526
Uh, wow. I, uh,
I didn't know that you'd call.

412

Who's Mistress Magda?

413
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,663
Nothing. She's a, uh, a...

414
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,064
Just a, uh... a close friend.

You know, it didn't work out.

422
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,380
I saw it.

423
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,215

Aw, crap.

That's... that's an old bone-yard
outside of Lawrence.

Why Lawrence?

I don't know.

438
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,674
It all has to end
where it started, I guess.

00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:08,941
All right, Chuck.

440
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:10,710
You know of any way
to short-circuit this thing?

441
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:11,811

442
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:14,246
No. I'm sorry.

443

I honestly don't know yet.

00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:23,756
All right. Thanks, Chuck.

I guess I got
nothing to lose, right?

457
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,786
I just want you
to understand...

458
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:59,388
The <i>only</i> thing
that you're gonna see out there

459
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,958
is Michael killing your brother.

460
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:08,330

it's finally here?

No.

Then why <i>are</i> we?

481
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:28,339
Oh, you know why.

482
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:31,776
I have no choice,
after what you did.

483
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:33,844
What I did?

484
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,511
What if it's not my fault?

485
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:36,679
What is that supposed to mean?

486
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:37,647
Think about it.

487
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:40,450
Dad made everything.

488
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:44,888
Which means
he <i>made</i> me who I am.

489

God <i>wanted</i> the devil.

490

So why?

492
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,561
And why make us fight?

493
00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:55,965

figure out the point.

And for what?

498
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:07,776
And we don't even
know the answer.

499
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,279
We're brothers.

500

walk off the chessboard.

I-I can't do that.

and I have my orders.

503

But you don't
have to follow them.

you think I'm gonna rebel?

505

Now?

I'm not like you.

You know, you haven't changed
a bit, little brother.

Always blaming
everybody but yourself.

510
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:43,910
We were together.
We were happy.

511
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:45,878
But you betrayed me,
all of us...

512
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:47,280
and you made our father leave.

514
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:51,318
He is doing this <i>to</i> us.

You're a monster, Lucifer.

516
00:27:58,391 --> 00:27:59,991
And I have to kill you.

536
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:15,529
Sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

537
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:19,254
Hey.

538
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,755
We need to talk.

539
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,164
Dean.

540
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:31,233
Even for you,

541
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:34,101
this is a whole new
mountain of stupid.

542
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:36,970
I'm not talking to <i>you.</i>
<i>I'm talking to, Sam.</i>

543
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:39,507
You're no longer
the vessel, Dean.

544
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:40,974
You got no right to be here.

545
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:45,879
Adam, if you're in there
somewhere, I am so sorry.

546
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,682
Adam isn't home right now.

547
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:49,516
Well, then you're next
on my list, Buttercup.

548
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,284
But right now, I need
five minutes with <i>him.</i>

549
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:52,552
You little maggot.

550
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,821
You are no longer
a part of this story!

551
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:56,155
Hey, ass-butt!

552
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:08,100
[Castiel breathing heavily]

553
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,438
"Ass-butt"?

554
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:14,773
He'll be back... and upset...

555
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:16,975
but you got your five minutes.

556
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:18,510
Castiel.

557
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,450
Did you just Molotov
my brother with holy fire?

558
00:30:27,153 --> 00:30:28,253
Uh... no.

559
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,989
No one dicks with
Michael, but <i>me.</i>

560
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:39,429
[panting]

561
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:47,371
Sammy, can you hear me?

562
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,842
You know...

563
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,310
I tried to be nice...

564
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:56,312
for Sammy's sake.

565
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,347
But you...

566
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:01,184
are such a pain...

567
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:04,287
in my ass.

568
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:05,554
[grunts]

569
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:09,725
[gunshot]

570
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:23,137
[bones crack]
N-o-o-o-o!

571
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:24,639
Yes.

572
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,580
Sammy?

573
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:35,649
Are you in there?

574
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:37,051
Oh, he's in there, all right.

575
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:41,155
And he's gonna feel
the snap of your bones.

576
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:46,893
Every single one.

577
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:50,663
We're gonna take our time.

578
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,804
Sam, it's okay.

579
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:00,605
It's okay. I'm here.

580
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:01,773
I'm here.

581
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:03,342
I'm not gonna leave you.

582
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:06,778
[voice breaking]
I'm not gonna leave you.

583
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:25,096
[wind howling]

584
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:03,598
[wind stops]

585
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:11,806
[gasps]

586
00:33:11,874 --> 00:33:12,807
[groans]

587
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:15,843
[panting]

588
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,248
It's okay, Dean.

589
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,618
It's gonna be okay.

590
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,821
I've got him.

591
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,425
[breathing heavily]

592
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:43,803
[chants spell]

593
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,172
[rumbling]

594
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:48,942
[wind howling]

595
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:12,496
Michael: Sam!

596
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:16,033
It's not gonna end this way!

597
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:17,268
Step back!

598
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:18,936
You're gonna
have to <i>make</i> me!

599
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:21,205
I have to fight
my brother, Sam!

600
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:23,073
Here and now!

601
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,740
It's my destiny!

602
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:06,114
[wind stops]

603
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,274
Cass, you're alive?

604
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,375
I'm better than that.

605
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:04,558
Cass, are you God?

606
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:07,061
That's a nice compliment,

607
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:08,095
but no.

608
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:13,067
Although, I do believe
he brought me back.

609
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:18,072
New and improved.

610
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,634
Chuck: <i>Endings are hard.</i>

611
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:53,938
<i>Any chapped-ass monkey</i>
<i>with a keyboard</i>

612
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:57,808
<i>Can poop out a beginning,</i>
<i>but endings are impossible.</i>

613
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:59,944
<i>You try to tie up</i>
<i>every loose end,</i>

614
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,145
<i>but you never can.</i>

615
00:37:01,213 --> 00:37:03,081
<i>The fans</i>
<i>are always gonna bitch.</i>

616
00:37:03,148 --> 00:37:04,815
<i>There's always gonna be holes.</i>

617
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:06,550
<i>And since it's the ending,</i>

618
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:08,218
<i>it's all supposed to</i>
<i>add up to something.</i>

619
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:10,487
<i>I'm telling you, they're</i>
<i>a raging pain in the ass.</i>

620
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:17,494
What are you gonna do now?

621
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,796
Return to heaven, I suppose.

622
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,731
Heaven?

623
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,133
With Michael in the cage,

624
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,800
I'm sure it's total
anarchy up there.

625
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,369
So, what... you're
the new sheriff in town?

626
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:30,373
I like that. Yeah,
I suppose I am.

627
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,807
Wow.

628
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,143
God gives you a brand-new,
shiny set of wings,

629
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,212
and suddenly
you're his bitch again.

630
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,780
I don't know
<i>what</i> God wants.

631
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,681
I don't know
if he'll even return.

632
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:42,617
It just... seems like
the right thing to do.

633
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:44,452
Well, if you do see him...

634
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,054
you tell him
I'm coming for him next.

635
00:37:48,257 --> 00:37:49,824
You're angry.

636
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,461
That's an understatement.

637
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:54,829
He helped.
[scoffs]

638
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,363
Maybe even
more than we realize.

639
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:58,032
That's easy for <i>you</i> to say.
He brought you back.

640
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,566
But what about Sam?

641
00:37:59,634 --> 00:38:00,901
What about <i>me,</i> huh?

642
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,636
Where's my grand prize?

643
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:05,205
All I got is
my brother in a hole!

644
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:08,175
You got what you asked for, Dean.

645
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,412
No paradise. No hell.

646
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:15,148
Just more of the same.

647
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:18,851
I mean it, Dean.

648
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:21,587
What would you rather have?

649
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:24,623
Peace or freedom?

650
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:35,700
Well, you really suck
at goodbye's, you know that?

651
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:45,042
<i>This is the last Dean and Bobby</i>
<i>will see of each other</i>

652
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,945
<i>for a very long time.</i>

653
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:54,918
<i>And for the record...</i>
<i>at this point next week,</i>

654
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,921
<i>Bobby will be hunting a Rugaru</i>
<i>outside of Dayton.</i>

655
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,723
<i>But not Dean.</i>

656
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,924
<i>Dean didn't want Cass</i>
<i>to save him.</i>

657
00:39:01,993 --> 00:39:04,160
<i>Every part of him,</i>
<i>every fiber he's got,</i>

658
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:05,895
<i>wants to die...</i>

659
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:08,164
<i>or find a way</i>
<i>to bring Sam back.</i>

660
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:10,300
<i>But he isn't gonna do either.</i>

661
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:12,735
<i>Because he made a promise.</i>

662
00:39:18,308 --> 00:39:19,608
[door creaks]

663
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,512
[voice breaking] Hey, Lisa.

664
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,382
Oh, thank God.

665
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:27,749
Are you all right?

666
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:33,154
Yeah.

667
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:35,990
Uh, if it's not too late, I...

668
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:38,592
think I'd like
to take you up on that beer.

669
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,031
It's never too late.

670
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,805
It's okay.

671
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:55,608
It's gonna be okay.

672
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,115
<i>So, what's it all add up to?</i>

673
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:04,150
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

674
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,885
<i>But me,</i>
<i>I'd say this</i> was <i>a test...</i>

675
00:40:06,953 --> 00:40:09,088
<i>for Sam and Dean.</i>

676
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,424
<i>And I think they did all right.</i>

677
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,293
<i>Up against good, evil,</i>

678
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:19,198
<i>angels, devils, destiny</i>
<i>and God himself.</i>

679
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:22,033
<i>They made their own choice.</i>

680
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:24,569
<i>They chose family.</i>

681
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:26,971
<i>And, well...</i>

682
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,541
<i>isn't that</i>
<i>kinda the whole point?</i>

683
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:38,715
<i>No doubt... endings are hard,</i>

684
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:41,918
<i>but then again...</i>

685
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:45,021
<i>nothing ever really ends,</i>
<i>does it?</i>

686
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:59,268
You okay?

687
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:01,471
Yeah, I'm good.
