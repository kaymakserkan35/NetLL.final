1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,270
Well Dad's gone now,
and we have to carry out his legacy

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,670
Hunting down as many evil
sons of bitches as we possibly can.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,440
Back in 1835, Samuel colt
made a gun for a hunter.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,840
This gun can kill anything.
There's only four bullets left.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,240
Without them,
this gun is useless.

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,910
Only thing it's good for now is
figuring out what makes it tick.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,070
Cute piece.
Won't stop a demon.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,370
- How the hell would you know?
- Call it an educated guess.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,270
Do you want me to help
you out with that gun or not?

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,270
- That deal you made to save Sam
- A year left.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,840
Been kind of liberating, actually.

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,270
You're not scared?

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,470
Of course not.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,510
How certain are you

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,240
That what you brought
back is 100% pure Sam?

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,510
You think something's
wrong with my brother?

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,740
Demons lie.
I'm sure Sam's okay.

18
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,770
Yeah, me too.

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,110
Come on, you guys.
Let's get it together.

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,340
You're on brick.

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,910
Yeah, i know, but I...

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,800
You're the brick guy.
I'm the wood guy.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,440
That's the way it's always been.

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,170
All I asked is for someone
to pick the color of the bricks.

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,970
Hey, what was that?

27
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,640
I don't know, a dog maybe.

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,540
It was a hell of a dog.

29
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,800
Okay, we got a crew
coming in the morning.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,240
Look at this wood?
Huh? Look at it. It's crap.

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,410
- Where'd you order it from?
- Same place as always.

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,740
Should have used the
cinder block like I wanted.

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,940
Here we go again.
You are not in charge.

34
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,370
You're a bunch of girls.

35
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,270
Look, it comes down to this, okay?

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,970
One gust of wind, and the
whole place is gonna blow over.

37
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,410
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever.

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

39
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,110
Kyle, come on.
Let's go.

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,110
Okay, I’m gonna go
warm up the truck.

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,070
Jack! Jack! Jack!

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,740
Jack!

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Supernatural 
Season 03 Episode 05 
"Bedtime Stories"

44
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,240
- I don't understand, Dean.
- Why not?

45
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,370
Because I said so.

46
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,010
- We got the Colt now.
- Sam.

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,140
We can summon the
crossroads demon,

48
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,910
Pull the gun on her, and force
her to let you out of the deal.

49
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,370
We'll just shoot her! If she
dies, the deal goes away!

50
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,470
We don't know if that
will work either, Sam!

51
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,740
You're pitching me a
bunch of "Ifs" and "Maybes"!

52
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,840
That's not good enough!

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,910
Because if we screw
with this deal, you die!

54
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,570
And if we don't screw with it, you die!

55
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,470
Sam, enough!
I'm not gonna have this conversation!

56
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,640
- Why, because you said so?
- Yes, because I said so!

57
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,310
Well, you’re not dad!

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,540
No, but I am the oldest.
And I’m doing what's best.

59
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,170
You got to let this go.
You understand me?

60
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,740
Tell me about the psychotic killer.

61
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,840
Come on, Sam, tell me
about the psychotic killer.

62
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,210
The psychotic killer

63
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,040
Rips victims apart
with brute-Like ferocity

64
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,610
Okay, any mention

65
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,700
Of his razor-Sharp teeth
or his 4-Inch claws, animal eyes?

66
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,140
No.

67
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,370
The lunar cycle's right.

68
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,310
Look, if it is a werewolf,
we don't have long.

69
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,940
Moon's full this Friday,

70
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,270
And that's the last time
it changes for a month.

71
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,670
Two days. No sweat.

72
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,740
I'm detective plant.
This is detective page.

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,310
We're with the
county sheriff's department.

74
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,700
Yeah, I’ve been expecting you.

75
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,070
You have?

76
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,570
All morning.

77
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,970
You are the sketch artists, right?

78
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,570
Absolutely.

79
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,540
Yeah.
That is exactly who my partner is.

80
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,700
The things he can do with a pen.

81
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,670
But listen, before we
get started on that,

82
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,540
I wanted to ask you
how'd you get away?

83
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,170
I- I have no idea.

84
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,240
Stared at me with this blank look.

85
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,800
After that, he just took off running.

86
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,670
Okay.

87
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,610
Um, i'm gonna need

88
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,170
As much physical
detail as you can remember.

89
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,010
He was about six feet tall...

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,540
Six feet..

91
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,640
Dark hair.

92
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,610
Um, what about his eyes?
What color eyes did he have?

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,370
Maybe... blue?
It was dark.

94
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,940
Did they seem, uh, animal-ish?

95
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,940
Excuse me?

96
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,270
What about his teeth?

97
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,800
You notice anything
strange about them?

98
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,770
No, they were just teeth.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Teeth. Okay.

100
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,470
How about his fingernails?

101
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,310
Okay, look, he's-
He's just a normal guy

102
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,870
With normal eyes and
teeth and fingernails.

103
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,140
- Look, sir, it's okay if...
- No

104
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,970
No

105
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,570
Those were my brothers.

106
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,700
This guy...

107
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,040
He killed my brothers.

108
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,470
How would you feel?

109
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,140
Can't imagine anything worse.

110
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,310
I know this isn't easy,

111
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,370
But if you could remember
any more details...

112
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,910
There was one more thing.

113
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,210
He had a tattoo on his
arm of a cartoon character.

114
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,910
Uh, ugh,it's the guy who
he's chasing the roadrunner.

115
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,010
- Wile e. Coyote.
- Yeah, that's it.

116
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,170
- Kyle?
- Dr. Garrison.

117
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,410
How you holding up?

118
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,110
Okay, considering...

119
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,740
- You're, uh, Kyle's doctor?
- Yes.

120
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,240
Can I just ask you a few questions?

121
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,770
Sure.

122
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,800
Don't I get to see it?

123
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,040
Um, yeah,it's a, you
know, work in progress.

124
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,570
It's really...

125
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,240
Boy, this is a piece of art, really.

126
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,540
Yeah, like you could
have done any better.

127
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,370
So, what did the doc have
to say about Kyle’s brothers?

128
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,570
Not much.
They were D. O. A. At the scene.

129
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,210
He did give me the lowdown
on the coroner's report.

130
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,800
Let me guess their
hearts were missing.

131
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,040
Nope, but chunks of their
kidneys, lungs,and intestines.

132
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,210
That's just gross.

133
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,870
Yeah, also definitely
not werewolf behavior.

134
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,270
- So, what
- Demon?

135
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,370
Attacker could have been possessed.

136
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,140
Why would a demon stop
halfway through an attack?

137
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,470
I think that, uh,
could've yeah, I got nothing.

138
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,770
Me, neither.

139
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,640
Okay, I am starving.

140
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,840
Wait, where are
all the power bars?

141
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,040
You ate them all.
And we're lost.

142
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,440
We're not lost.
The path is right here.

143
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,640
Look. There.

144
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,340
Civilization.

145
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,110
Thank god.

146
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,940
Are you two doing okay?

147
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,210
Hi, actually we're lost.

148
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,310
Oh, it happens.

149
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,840
The trail gets twisty,

150
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,110
And my house is the
only one left up here.

151
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,010
I could point you in
the right direction,

152
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,040
But I’m afraid it'll take a
while to get back.

153
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,240
You're really deep into the woods.

154
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Nice work, Ken.

155
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,240
Would you like to
come in and rest a bit?

156
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,770
Um, yeah.

157
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,870
Thanks, but we should head back.

158
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,700
Come on, honey. She offered.

159
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,740
- She's a harmless old lady.
What could happen?

160
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,940
You sure you don't want more?

161
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,340
No, thank you.

162
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,870
I'm full.

163
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,410
We should go.

164
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,310
We really can't thank you enough.

165
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,070
What's going on?

166
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,170
Are we

167
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,440
Did she drug us?

168
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,270
Stop.
Please, you have to stop.

169
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,070
Don't worry.

170
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,270
Everything's fine.

171
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,340
You just hold still now, dear.

172
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,010
Stop it! Stop!

173
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,110
Why are you doing this to us?!
Stop! Stop hurting him!

174
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,970
Stop it now!

175
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,940
Please.

176
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,410
We need to observe you

177
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,510
While the drugs still
may be in your system.

178
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,210
I have things to do,
arrangements I need to make.

179
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,770
It can wait.

180
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,840
Now, you need to rest.
Stay, please.

181
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,870
I'll be back in a few minutes.

182
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,970
Detectives.

183
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,110
Dr. Garrison.

184
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,040
What the hell's going on here?
My whole town's going insane.

185
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,270
We'll let you know as soon as we do.

186
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,240
Miss Watson?

187
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,240
Hi. Need to ask you a few questions.

188
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,670
Do we have to go over this again?
Now?

189
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,910
We'll try to be brief.

190
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,540
Miss Watson,
can you tell us how you got away?

191
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,970
I didn't eat as much as ken did,
so I wasn't as out of it.

192
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,310
And when the old woman was...

193
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,570
Carving up ken,

194
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,010
I shoved her.

195
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,410
And she fell, cracked
her head on the stove.

196
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,370
She's dead, right?
I- I killed her?

197
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,570
Do you have any idea
why she did this to you?

198
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,840
No.

199
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,770
One minute,
she's just a sweet old lady,

200
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,610
And the next,
she was like a monster.

201
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,410
Can you remember anything else?

202
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,510
Um, yeah.

203
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,210
Did you find a little girl there,
by any chance?

204
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,740
A little girl?

205
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,270
At the house?

206
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,370
I thought I saw her
outside the window.

207
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,440
S- She just disappeared...

208
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,340
Just vanished into thin air.

209
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,970
It must have been the drugs.

210
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,810
This disappearing girl,
what did she look like?

211
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,110
Does it matter?

212
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,770
Yes, every detail matters.

213
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,110
She had this dark, dark hair

214
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,070
And really pale skin.

215
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,870
She was around 8.
She was a beautiful child.

216
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,310
It was... odd to see her in the
middle of something so horrible.

217
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,470
Well, there’s no sulfur anywhere.

218
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,670
How about the EMF?

219
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,810
Yeah, it's going nuts

220
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,310
When I went over
here by the window.

221
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,740
There was definitely a spirit here.

222
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,140
Who stood outside the
crime scene and watched?

223
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,440
Looks like.

224
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,470
What the hell do you make of that?

225
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,610
Actually, I do have
a theory. Uh, sort of.

226
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,170
Hit me.

227
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,370
Well, thinking about fairy tales.

228
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,710
Oh, that's... that's nice.

229
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,770
You think about fairy tales often?

230
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,770
No, Dean,i'm talking
about the murders.

231
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,910
A guy and a girl hiking
through the woods.

232
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,710
An old lady tries to eat them.
That's "Hansel and Gretel. "

233
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,710
Then we got the three brothers
arguing over how to build houses

234
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,310
Attacked by the big bad wolf.

235
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,670
- "Three little pigs".
- Yeah.

236
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,810
Actually, those guys
were a little chubby.

237
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,540
Well,wait, I thought all those things

238
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,910
Ended with everybody
living happily ever after.

239
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,410
No, no.
Not the originals.

240
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,040
See, the "Grimm brothers" stuff

241
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,310
Was kind of like the
folklore of its day

242
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,810
Full of sex, violence, cannibalism.

243
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,810
Then it got sanitized over the years,

244
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,740
Turned into Disney flicks
and bedtime stories.

245
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,510
So, you think the murders
are, what, a re-Enactment?

246
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,140
It's a little crazy.

247
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,470
As crazy as what?
Every day of our lives?

248
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,170
Toucher.

249
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,970
How's the creepy ghost girl involved?

250
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,240
Um,she must have
been here for a reason.

251
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,040
I'm willing to bet you top dollar

252
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,970
She was at the
construction site, too.

253
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,040
We got to do research
now, don’t we?

254
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,570
So?

255
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,470
Found the usual amount

256
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,710
Of violent childhood deaths
for a town this size.

257
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,110
Do you want to know

258
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,570
How many were little girls
with black hair and pale skin?

259
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,810
- Zero.
- Zero.

260
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,140
Do you want to know

261
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,470
How many little girls with
black hair and pale skin

262
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,870
Have gone missing?

263
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,770
Right again. Zip,zilch,nada.

264
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,370
Tell me you got something good,

265
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,840
Cause I’ve totally wasted
the last six hours.

266
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,870
Well, you ever hear of Lillian Bailey?

267
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,070
She was a British
medium from the 1930s.

268
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,940
She got a thing for fairy tales?

269
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,370
See, she’d go into these
unconscious states

270
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,040
Where,um - Get this
- Her thoughts and actions

271
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,710
Were completely controlled by spirits.

272
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,370
- A ghost puppet master?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,540
You think that's what this kid is doing?

274
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,540
And making them go kill-Crazy?

275
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,770
Could be.

276
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,940
You know, kind of like a spirit
hypnosis or something.

277
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,640
Trances I get,
but fairy-Tale trances?

278
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,970
That's bizarre, even for us.

279
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,170
Yeah,you're right.
That's completely normal.

280
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,070
All right, maybe it is fairy tales

281
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,910
Totally messed-Up fairy tales.

282
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,240
I'll tell you one thing.

283
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,840
There's no way I’m
kissing a damn frog.

284
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,410
Hey,check that out.

285
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,970
Yeah, it’s close to Halloween.

286
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,740
You remember Cinderella?

287
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,510
The pumpkin that turns into a coach

288
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,640
And the mice that become horses.

289
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,540
Dude, could you be more gay?

290
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,770
Don't answer that.

291
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,340
Oh, who knows?

292
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,110
Maybe you'll find your
fairy godmother.

293
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,910
Help! I'm in here!

294
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,340
Hey. Hi. It's okay.
We're here. We got you.

295
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,310
You have to help me.
She's a lunatic.

296
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,770
My step mom

297
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,470
She just freaked out, screamed
at me, beat me, chained me up.

298
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,570
Where is she now?

299
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,770
Sam

300
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,870
Who are you?

301
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,100
Paramedics picked up Cinderella.

302
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,130
- That's good.
- Yeah.

303
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,260
So, little girl, shiny red apple.

304
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,460
That means something
to you, fairy-Tale boy?

305
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,700
I think it's snow white.

306
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,200
"Snow white"?

307
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,230
Oh, i saw that movie.
Oh, the porn version, anyways.

308
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,200
There was this wicked stepmother
- She was wicked.

309
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,260
There is a wicked stepmother,

310
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,130
And she tries to kill snow
white with a poison apple.

311
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,800
But the apple doesn't
actually kill the girl, right?

312
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,600
No. Puts her into a deep sleep

313
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,930
So deep, it’s almost
like she's dead.

314
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,760
No, sorry.
We don't have any comatose little girls.

315
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,600
You sure? Totally.

316
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,330
It's mostly old guys, and, well, Callie.

317
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,500
She's been around
since before I started here.

318
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,100
Callie?

319
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,360
Yeah. It's so sad.

320
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Poor Dr. Garrison
- He won't give up on her.

321
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,800
Was Callie one of his patients?

322
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,130
No, his daughter.

323
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,660
Here we are.

324
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,930
Just press the latch,
called out the grandmother.

325
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,630
I'm too weak to get up.

326
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,200
"The wolf pressed the latch,
and the door opened.

327
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,730
"He stepped inside, went
straight to the grandmother,

328
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,830
And ate her up. "

329
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,630
Thank you so much.

330
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,700
The huntsman stepped inside,
and in the bed lay the wolf.

331
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,060
"So, the huntsman
took a pair of scissors

332
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,560
And cut open the wolf's belly. "

333
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,730
Detectives, can I help you?

334
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,930
We just heard that
Callie is your daughter.

335
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,630
And we wanted to say
how very sorry we are.

336
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,660
Well,uh, thank you.

337
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,560
If you'll excuse me...

338
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,500
Oh, we're heading this way.
We'll walk with you.

339
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,800
How long has Callie been like that?

340
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,200
W- We don't mean to intrude.

341
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,630
We can't possibly understand
how hard it must be

342
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,760
for you seeing her like this.

343
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,260
Yeah, it’s not easy.

344
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,460
She's uh, been here
since she was 8 years old.

345
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,030
That's when she was poisoned?

346
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,760
Yeah, swallowed bleach.

347
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,430
Never figured out how she
got her hands on the bottle.

348
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,630
My wife found her,
brought her to the ER here,

349
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,360
And I was on call.

350
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,060
Your wife was, uh
was that Callie's stepmother?

351
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,130
Actually, yes.
How'd you know that?

352
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Lucky guess.

353
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, Julie was the only mother
that Callie ever knew.

354
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,360
My wife passed away last year,

355
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,960
And, uh,it's just
my daughter and me now.

356
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,930
She's all I got left.

357
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Um, excuse me.
I've got to get back to work.

358
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah.

359
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,830
Well, you’re right.
It's snow white in spades.

360
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Yep. Step mom poisons the girl,
puts her into a deep sleep.

361
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,100
What's the motive, you think?

362
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,400
It could be like Mischa Barton.

363
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,900
What?!

364
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,100
They, you know fairy tales.
I know movies.

365
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,530
She played the pasty ghost.

366
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,760
Remember the mom
had that thing, you know,

367
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,700
Where you keep the kid sick
so you get all the attention?

368
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,460
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah.
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

369
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,800
Huh, could be.

370
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,560
So, say, all these years Callie’s
been suffering silently

371
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,100
Because nobody knows the truth
about what mommy dearest did.

372
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,630
And after all this time,
her spirit just gets angrier

373
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,700
Until it finally just starts lashing out.

374
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,560
Meanwhile, she has to listen
to dad tell her deranged stories

375
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,630
About a rabid wolf or
a cannibalistic old lady.

376
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,300
It's enough to drive anybody nuts.

377
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,200
Okay, but how are
we gonna stop her?

378
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,300
Callie is stuck here.

379
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,200
Her father's keeping her body alive.

380
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,900
That does make it hard
to burn the bones.

381
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,360
You think?

382
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,100
Hey, what's the status?

383
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,530
72-Year-Old female

384
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,760
Sustained multiple lacerations
and puncture wounds.

385
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,360
B.P. Is 80 over 40 and falling.
Sinus tachycardia.

386
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,860
Is that a bite?

387
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,400
Look like she was mauled by
a mad dog or maybe a wolf.

388
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,260
What was the last story
Dr. Garrison was reading Callie?

389
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,400
"Little Red Riding Hood. "

390
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,060
Excuse me.
Was she the only victim?

391
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,830
She was found by the side
of the road, barely alive. Alone.

392
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,300
We need to find her next of kin.

393
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,500
She has a granddaughter.

394
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,430
Do you have an address?

395
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,700
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

396
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,760
You find a way to stop Callie, all right?

397
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,960
What about you?

398
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,900
I'm gonna go stop the big bad wolf...

399
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,960
Which is the weirdest
thing I’ve ever said.

400
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,400
Hey, grandma.

401
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,210
Dr. Garrison, I need to speak with you.

402
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,870
Detective, what can I do for you?

403
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,370
Well,um,it's about Callie.

404
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,970
My daughter?
What about her?

405
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,510
- You know, maybe
- Maybe could we sit down for a minute?

406
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,540
No. What about her?

407
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,710
Okay,well,um...

408
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,210
All right, doctor,
this isn't gonna be easy.

409
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,540
What happened to
Callie was not an accident.

410
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,870
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

411
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,770
You have no idea what
happened to my daughter.

412
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,710
There are things you don't know,
doctor, about your wife.

413
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,270
My wife?!

414
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,510
Doctor, your wife poisoned Callie.

415
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,510
Why would you say something
so horrible to me?

416
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,640
Because I need your help.

417
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,270
You stay away from me
and from my daughter.

418
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,740
You understand?

419
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,870
Doctor, this is please...

420
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,610
I'm calling security.

421
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,540
No, listen
- I don't have time to do this gently.

422
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,970
If you don't listen to me,
more people are going to get hurt

423
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,870
Because Callie is going to hurt them.

424
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,110
What the hell are you talking about?

425
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,040
You're gonna think I’m crazy,
but just understand me.

426
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,710
Your daughter,
Callie, is still here.

427
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,940
She's a spirit.

428
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,770
So, you’ve seen her, too?

429
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,710
Are you okay? Yeah.

430
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,470
I sensed her... Callie.

431
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,910
Her presence, her scent.

432
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,840
I even saw her standing
at the foot of my bed,

433
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,270
But I never believed it.

434
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,070
I thought I was dreaming.

435
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,240
It wasn't a dream.

436
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,170
She looks like she did
when she was 8.

437
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,710
White dress, red ribbon in her hair.

438
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,810
She's been trying to talk to you.

439
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,910
- You're not a cop, are you?
- No.

440
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,310
Then who are you?

441
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,610
Someone who knows a
little bit about this kind of thing.

442
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,840
Sir, Callie told us.

443
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,610
What?

444
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,340
Not in so many words.

445
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,470
But in her own way, she told us.

446
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,710
My wife loved Callie!
So, how's that possible?

447
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,370
I don't know, but it is.

448
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,070
No, no. I don't believe you.

449
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,670
Look, Callie is killing people.

450
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,110
She's angry.

451
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,310
She's desperate because
nobody will listen to her.

452
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,840
So you have to listen to her.

453
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,840
Please...

454
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,240
Listen to your daughter.

455
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,710
Callie?

456
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,810
Callie, it's Daddy.

457
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,340
It's me, Daddy.

458
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,640
Is it true?
Mommy do that to you?

459
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,870
I- I know I wasn't listening
before, but I'm listening now.

460
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,840
Daddy's here.

461
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,270
- Please,honey,is
- Is there any way that you can tell me?

462
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,170
Doctor.

463
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,370
Is it true?

464
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,140
Oh,i'm so sorry, baby.

465
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,270
But listen to me.

466
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,840
You got to stop what
you're doing, okay?

467
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,710
You're hurting people.

468
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,070
I know everything now.

469
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,340
I know the truth.

470
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,910
It's time for you to let go.

471
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,440
It's time for me to let you go.

472
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,470
Stop! Stop!

473
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,870
Whoa, stop! Whoa, whoa!

474
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,270
Where - Where am I?
What's going on?

475
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,600
And the girl's okay?

476
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,300
So... it's really over.

477
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,060
Yeah. All thanks to you.

478
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,860
Callie was the most
important thing in my life,

479
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,300
But I should have let her
go a long time ago.

480
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,660
See you around,doc.

481
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,700
I sure hope not.

482
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,800
You know what he said.

483
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,630
Some good advice.

484
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,160
Is that what you want me to do, Dean?

485
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,600
Just let you go?

486
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,000
Well, little Sammy Winchester.

487
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm touched.

488
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:40,160
I mean, your brother's been
to see me twice, but you...

489
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,260
I never had the pleasure.

490
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,060
What can I do for you, Sam?

491
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,460
You can beg for your life.

492
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,860
We were having such
a nice conversation.

493
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,160
Hence you had to go
and ruin the mood.

494
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,660
If I were you,

495
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,900
I'd drop the wisecracks
and start acting scared.

496
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,130
It's not my style.

497
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,330
That's not the original colt.

498
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,460
Where did you get that?

499
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,530
Ruby.

500
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,900
Had to be.

501
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,730
She is such a pain in my ass.

502
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,030
She'll get what's coming to her.

503
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,700
You can count on it.

504
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,930
That's enough.

505
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,100
I came here to make you an offer.

506
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,560
You're gonna make me an offer?

507
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,100
That's adorable.

508
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,700
You can let dean out of
his deal right now.

509
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,500
He lives, I live, you live.

510
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,830
Everyone goes home happy.

511
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,260
Or...

512
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,330
...you stop breathing.

513
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,430
All this tough talk.

514
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,560
I got to tell you,
it's not very convincing.

515
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,800
I mean, come on, Sam.

516
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,100
Do you even want to break the deal?

517
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,130
What do you think?

518
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,430
I don't know.

519
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,760
Aren't you tired of
cleaning up dean's messes,

520
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,430
Of dealing with that
broken psyche of his?

521
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,700
Aren't you tired...

522
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,330
Of being bossed around
like a snot-Nosed little brother?

523
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,100
You're stronger than Dean.
You're better than him.

524
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,300
Watch your mouth.

525
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,760
Admit it. You're here,
going through the motions,

526
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,600
But truth is, you’ll be a tiny
bit relieved when he's gone.

527
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,830
Shut up.

528
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,230
No more desperate,
sloppy, needy Dean.

529
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,430
You can finally be free.

530
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,900
I said, "Shut up" 

531
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,300
Doth protest too much,
if you ask me.

532
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,360
All right,
I’ve had enough of your crap.

533
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
You let dean out of
his deal right now.

534
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,500
Sorry, sweetheart,
but your brother's an adult.

535
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:03,360
He made that deal of his
own free will, fair and square.

536
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,000
It's ironclad.

537
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,830
Every deal can be broken.

538
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,200
Not this one.

539
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,760
Fine. Then I'll kill you.

540
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,730
If you're gone, so is the deal.

541
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,300
Guess again.

542
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,430
What?

543
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,660
Sam, I'm just a saleswoman.

544
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,960
I got a boss, like everybody.

545
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,860
He holds the contract, not me.

546
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,330
He wants Dean's soul bad.

547
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,960
And believe me,
he's not gonna let it go.

548
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,130
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

549
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,560
Shoot me, if it will get you off,

550
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,200
But the deal still holds.

551
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,130
And when Dean's time is up,
he's getting dragged into the pit.

552
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,700
And who's your boss?
Who holds the contract?

553
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,560
He's not as cuddly as me,
I can tell you that.

554
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,800
Who is it?

555
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,060
I can't tell you.

556
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,330
I'm sorry, Sam,

557
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,700
But there's no way out of this one -

558
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,430
Not this time.

559
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:33,000
