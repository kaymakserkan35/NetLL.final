1
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,134
I remember now, I'm an angel.

2
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:09,134
I have death sentence on my head.

3
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:10,134
- Why.
- I disobeyed.

4
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:11,635
You really shouldn't have come.

5
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,407
You have to stop it.

6
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:19,069
Stop what?

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,287
1973?

8
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,629
Mom?

9
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:25,878
John Winchester.

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,516
My parents are Mary
and John Winchester

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,192
and I am your grandson.

12
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:37,581
Mary gets killed by a
yellow-eyed demon in 1983.

13
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:39,618
Now, if we don't catch
this thing now and kill it

14
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:41,927
and it gets away... then Mary dies.

15
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,739
No!

16
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:48,645
Aaaaahh!

17
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,021
I couldn't stop any of it.
She still made the deal

18
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:54,792
she still died in the nursery, didn't she?

19
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:57,167
Destiny can't be changed, Dean.

20
00:00:57,202 --> 00:01:00,748
All roads lead to the same destination.

21
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:05,294
# she's my cherry pie #

22
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:06,463
# cool drink of water... #

23
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:09,738
Oh, I take it all back. I love the devil.

24
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:12,815
# Grown man cry, sweet cherry pie #

25
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,549
# oh, yeah #

26
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:19,065
# put a smile on your face 10 miles wide #

27
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,705
# looks so good, bring a tear to your eye #

28
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:23,706
# sweet cherry pie #

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,875
# sweet cherry... #

30
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,611
Now, that's what I call peace on earth.

31
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:30,019
# Pi-I-I-e #

32
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,558
# huh! #

33
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,231
# swing it #

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,702
Anna?

35
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:43,410
I was just, uh, working on a case.

36
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:45,747
This is what you dream about.

37
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:49,053
This is awkward.

38
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,323
Why are you gate-crashing my head?

39
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,794
why don't you just
swing by the motel?

40
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,265
I can't find you.

41
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,602
Oh. Cass did this thing.

42
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:00,806
Cass. Right.

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,942
Now, there's a friend
you can count on.

44
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:05,012
What?

45
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:06,815
He didn't tell you?

46
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,851
Tell me what?

47
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:10,487
Where I've been.

48
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,623
Of course not. Why would he?

49
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:13,926
Where have you been?

50
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,297
Prison.

51
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:18,833
Upstairs.

52
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:21,637
All the torture,
twice the self-righteousness.

53
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:24,308
- Why wouldn't he have told us where you were?
- 'Cause he's the one who turned me in.

54
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:26,344
Don't look so shocked

55
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:27,980
he was always a
good little soldier

56
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,115
did anything under orders.

57
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,953
I didn't know. Are you okay?

58
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:35,791
No, and I don't have long.

59
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:37,193
I broke out...

60
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:38,796
barely.

61
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,730
They're looking for me,

62
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:41,299
if they find me...

63
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,168
Okay. What do you need?

64
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:45,805
Meet me. 225 industrial

65
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,542
and please, just hurry.

66
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,451
Hello?

67
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:23,354
Who's there?

68
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,565
Hello, Anna.

69
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,970
Well...

70
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:40,274
If I didn't know any better...

71
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:43,812
I'd say the Winchesters don't trust me.

72
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:46,716
They do. I don't.

73
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,917
I wouldn't let them come.

74
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,253
And why is that?

75
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,322
If you're out of prison,
it's because they let you out

76
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,124
and they sent you here
to do their dirty work.

77
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,527
And what makes you so sure?

78
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:59,631
Because I've experienced...
heaven's persuasion.

79
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:02,100
You mean when you
gave me to them.

80
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:05,371
That was a mistake.

81
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:09,576
Anna, whatever they
sent you here to do...

82
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,913
They didn't send me. I escaped.

83
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:14,215
No one escapes.

84
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:18,119
All these centuries, and you're
underestimating me now?

85
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,454
If you're not one of them,
then what do you want?

86
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:22,189
I want to help.

87
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,858
- You want to help?
- Yes.

88
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:26,226
Then what are you
doing with that knife?

89
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:34,765
I'm not allowed to defend myself?

90
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,469
Against whom? That blade
doesn't work against angels.

91
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,137
It's not like this one.

92
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:42,339
Maybe you're not
working for heaven

93
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,741
but there's something
you're not telling me.

94
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:52,849
Sam Winchester has to die.

95
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:58,849
Supernatural Season 5 Episode 13
"The Song Remains The Same"

96
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:05,658
I am sorry. But we
have no choice.

97
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:08,527
He's Lucifer's vessel.

98
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:10,729
- He's not the only one.
- What? That guy Nick?

99
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:13,030
He's burning away as we speak.

100
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,164
No.

101
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,533
Sam is the only
vessel that matters.

102
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,602
You know what that means.

103
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:23,572
If Lucifer can't take Sam,
his whole plan short-circuits.

104
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:27,042
No fight with Michael,
no croatoan virus,

105
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,644
the horsemen go back
to their day jobs.

106
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:33,046
Even if you could... kill Sam,

107
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,914
Satan would just
bring him back to life.

108
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,284
Not after I scatter his
cells across the universe.

109
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:42,154
They'll never find
him... not all of him.

110
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:48,492
We'll find another way.

111
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,894
How's that going?

112
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:54,664
How's the colt working out?
or the search for god?

113
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:56,766
Is anything working?

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,303
If you want to stop
the devil, this is how.

115
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,405
The answer is still no.

116
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,809
Because, Sam is my friend.

117
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:12,278
You've changed.

118
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:15,214
Maybe too late

119
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:17,649
but I have.

120
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:22,520
Anna, we've been
through much together

121
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,955
but you come near Sam Winchester,

122
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,190
and I'll kill you.

123
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:37,799


124
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,735


125
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,540
Oh, my god.

126
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,108
Oh, my god. Hey.

127
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,577
- Oh, my god.
- Hey. You okay?

128
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,479
We have to get her
to a hospital. Come on.

129
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,714


130
00:06:56,748 --> 00:07:01,851


131
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,586
Really? Anna?

132
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,055
- I don't believe it.
- It's true.

133
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,457
So she's gone all Glenn Close,
huh? That's awesome.

134
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:11,592
Who's Glenn Close?

135
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:12,859
No one.

136
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,729
Just this psycho bitch who
likes to boil rabbits.

137
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:17,430
So, t-the... the
plan to kill me...

138
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,599
would it actually stop Satan?

139
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:20,767
No, Sam, come on.

140
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:23,970
Cass, what do you think?
does Anna have a point?

141
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:27,139
No.

142
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:29,575
She's a... "Glenn Close."

143
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,877
I don't get it.

144
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:35,178
We're looking for the chick
that wants to gank Sam?

145
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:36,446
Why poke the bear?

146
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,348
Anna will keep trying,

147
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:41,484
she won't give up until Sam is dead.

148
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:44,052
So we kill her first.

149
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:07,604
- I found her.
- Where is she?

150
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,306
Not where.

151
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,941
When.

152
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,110
It's 1978.

153
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,311
What?

154
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,548
Why 1978? I wasn't even born yet.

155
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,350
You won't be...
If she kills your parents.

156
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,952
What?

157
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:27,521
Anna can't get to
you because of me

158
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,389
- so she's going after them.
- Take us back right now.

159
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:32,525
And deliver you right to Anna?
I should go alone.

160
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,360
They're our parents, Cass.
We're going.

161
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,028
It's not that easy.

162
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,096
- Why not?
- Time travel was difficult

163
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,198
even with the powers of
heaven at my disposal.

164
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:41,499
But you're cut off.

165
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,634
So, what? You're like a delorean
without enough plutonium.

166
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:46,069
I don't understand that reference.

167
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:47,637
But I'm telling you,

168
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:50,339
taking this trip,
with passengers, no less...

169
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:53,875
It'll weaken me.

170
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,012
They're our mom and dad.

171
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:00,314
If we can save them,
and not just from Anna...

172
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:02,583
I mean, if we can set things right...

173
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:04,885
we have to try.

174
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,359
Ready?

175
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:17,028
Not really.

176
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:18,896
Bend your knees.

177
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:29,224
Geez!

178
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:34,062
Huh...

179
00:09:36,164 --> 00:09:38,432
Did we make it?

180
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:40,834
Unless they're bringing
pintos back into production,

181
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:43,202
I, uh, I'd say yes.

182
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:45,771
Cass?

183
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:46,972
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

184
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,241
Take it easy. Take it
easy. You all right?

185
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:50,842
I'm fine.

186
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:53,044
I'm much better than I expected.

187
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,780
Cass!

188
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:59,316
He's breathing... sort of.

189
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:01,151
What do we do?

190
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,529
I mean, the moustaches alone...

191
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:16,498
So I paid for Cass for five nights
up in the, uh, honeymoon suite.

192
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,099
I told the manager.
"Do not disturb, no matter what."

193
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,868
You know what he said to me?

194
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:21,702
"Yeah. Don't sweat it.
Want to buy some dope?"

195
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,138
Dope.

196
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:26,373
We ought to stick around here,
buy some stock in Microsoft.

197
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:30,076
Yeah, we might have to
if Cass doesn't recover.

198
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,844
Is he all right?

199
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:33,745
What do I look like... Dr.
Angel, medicine woman?

200
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,578
He'll wake up.

201
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:37,881
He's, you know, tough for a
little nerdy dude with wings.

202
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,983
If he landed like that,
hopefully, so did Anna.

203
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,051
Should buy us some time.

204
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:42,418
So, did you find 'em?

205
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:46,054
Yeah. Uh... The
Winchesters. 485 robin tree.

206
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:48,957
Let's go pop in on the folks.

207
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,969
Sam. Sam. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

208
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:04,737
Dean, Anna could
be here any second.

209
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:07,205
What exactly are we gonna
march up there and tell 'em?

210
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,073
- Uh, the truth.
- What, that their sons are back from the future

211
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:12,075
to save them from an
angel gone "Terminator"?

212
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,310
Come on. Those movies
haven't even come out yet.

213
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,944
Well, then tell her
demons are after 'em.

214
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:17,579
I mean, she thinks
you're a hunter, right?

215
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:19,647
Yeah, a hunter who disappeared
right when her dad died.

216
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:22,185
She's gonna love me.

217
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:24,621
Just follow my lead.

218
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:32,430
How was work?

219
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:35,063
It was, uh, great.

220
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,163
Ah! Not until you wash up.

221
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,231
I love when you get bossy.

222
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:52,608
Hi, Mary.

223
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,009
You can't be here.

224
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,910
I'm sorry if this is a bad time.

225
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:58,379
You don't understand. I'm not...

226
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,215
I don't do that anymore.

227
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,951
I have a normal life
now. You have to go.

228
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,454
I'm sorry, but this is important, okay?

229
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,657
Sorry, sweetie, they're just...

230
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:12,192
Mary's cousins.

231
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:14,361
Yeah, we couldn't stop through town

232
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:16,229
without swinging by and saying
"hey," now, could we?

233
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,098
Dean.

234
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:19,598
You look familiar.

235
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:21,166
Really?

236
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,201
Yeah, you do, too,
actually, you know?

237
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:25,869
We must have met sometime.

238
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,504
Small towns, right? Got to love 'em.

239
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,905
I'm John.

240
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:35,344
This is Sam.

241
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:38,446
Sam. Uh, Mary's
father was a Sam.

242
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,981
Uh, it's a... it's a family name.

243
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:46,020
You okay, pal?
You look a little spooked.

244
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,223
Oh. Oh, yeah.

245
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:52,060
Just a... long trip.

246
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,296
Yeah.

247
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,799
Well, Sam and Dean were
just on their way out.

248
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,234
What? They just got here.

249
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:00,837
Real happy to meet
folks from Mary's side.

250
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:03,239
Please come on in for a beer.

251
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:05,141
Twist my arm.

252
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:13,848
Are you sure you're okay, Sam?

253
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,182
Wh... oh.

254
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:17,184
Yeah, yeah. Um, I'm just, um...

255
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:20,821
You are so beautiful.

256
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,688
He means that in a-a non-weird,

257
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:26,356
wholesome, family kind of a way.

258
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,390
Yeah, right.

259
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:30,723
We haven't seen Mary in...
in quite some time, and...

260
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,857
See, she's the spitting
image of our mom.

261
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,992
- I mean, it's... it's...
- Eerie.

262
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:39,662
So, how are you guys related?

263
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,528
You know, uh, distantly.

264
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:44,364
Oh. So you knew Mary's parents?

265
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:45,598
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

266
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:48,267
Mary's dad was, uh...

267
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:50,602
Pretty much like a grandpa to us.

268
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,203
Oh.

269
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:56,439
That was tragic... that heart attack.

270
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:58,074


271
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:00,709
Yes, it was.

272
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:04,879
So, uh, what are you guys
doing in town, anyway?

273
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,980
Uh, business, you know.

274
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,115
- Oh, yeah? What line of work? - Plumbing.
- Scrap metal.

275
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,217
Oh, gosh. It's almost 7:00.

276
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:13,019
I hate to be rude,
but I got to get dinner ready.

277
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,722
- Maybe they could stay.
- I'm sure they have to leave.

278
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,892
Uh, look, please stay.

279
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,760
You know, it would
mean a lot to me.

280
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:24,630
I-I haven't met much of
Mary's side of the family.

281
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,331


282
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,833


283
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:31,602
Look, Mr. Woodson,
I'm begging you to reconsider.

284
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:34,237
I'd like to, John.
You're a great mechanic

285
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:36,372
but times ain't exactly rosy.

286
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:38,707
E-even just part time.
I really need this job.

287
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:41,710
All right, look. Come on
in right now, let's talk.

288
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:44,012
Maybe we can figure something out.

289
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,680
You serious?

290
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:49,449
I'll see you in 10 minutes.
Don't keep me waiting.

291
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:50,850
You have to leave. Now.

292
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:52,785
- Okay, just listen...
- No, you listen.

293
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,621
Last time I saw you,
a demon killed my parents.

294
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:58,523
Now you waltz in
here like you're family?

295
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:02,026
Whatever you want... no. Leave me alone.

296
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:03,794
You and John are in danger.

297
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,363
What are you talking about?

298
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:07,031
Something's coming for you.

299
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:08,632
Demon?

300
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,667
- Not exactly.
- Well, what, then?

301
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,568
It's kind of hard to explain,
okay? It's... it's...

302
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:15,470
an angel.

303
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:17,171
What?

304
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:20,106
- There's no such thing.
- I wish.

305
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,008
But they're twice as strong
as demons... and bigger dicks.

306
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:25,343
Why would an angel want to kill us?

307
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,477
It's a long story, and we'll
tell you the whole thing,

308
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:31,015
but right now, you've got to
trust us, and we got to go.

309
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,785
Look at my face and tell
me if I'm lying to you.

310
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,090
Okay.

311
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,493
- Where do we go?
- Out of here. We got to move now, though.

312
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,528
Okay. But what do I tell John?

313
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:44,597
Just tell him...

314
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:47,700
John?

315
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:10,718
Mr. Woodson?

316
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,953
You still here?

317
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:59,553
I wish I could say it's
good to see you, Anna.

318
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:00,821
You too, Dean.

319
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:33,556
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,325
Sorry.

321
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,427
It's not that easy to kill an angel.

322
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,463
No. But you can distract 'em.

323
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,938
Monsters.

324
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:44,439
Monsters?

325
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:45,507
Yes.

326
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,575
Monsters are real.

327
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,212
- I'm sorry, I didn't know how...
- And you fight them? All of you?

328
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,881
Yeah.

329
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:56,052
How long?

330
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:59,889
All my life.

331
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:04,092
- John, just try to understand
- She didn't exactly have a choice...

332
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:05,827
Shut up, all of you!

333
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,896
Look, not another word, or so help me,
I will turn this car around!

334
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:17,536
Wow. Awkward family road trip.

335
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,405
No kidding.

336
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:32,512
Place has been in the family for years.

337
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:36,115
Devil's trap.

338
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:38,550
Pure iron fixtures, of course.

339
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:41,886
Um, there should be salt and
holy water in the pantry,

340
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,153
Knives, guns.

341
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:45,655
All that stuff will do is piss it off.

342
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,890
So, what will kill it?
Or slow it down, at least?

343
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:50,225
Not much.

344
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,927
Great.

345
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:54,129
He said not much, not nothing.

346
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:55,897
We packed.

347
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:02,103
If we put this up...

348
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:04,505
and she comes close,

349
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,306
we beam her right off the starship.

350
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,340
Mm.

351
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,808
This is holy oil.

352
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:13,610
It's kind of like a,
like a devil's trap for angels.

353
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,778
Come on. I'll show
you how it works.

354
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,687
Hey, what's the deal with
the thing on the paper?

355
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:31,390
It's a sigil. That means...

356
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:34,326
I don't care what it means.
Where does it go?

357
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,895
On a wall or a door.

358
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:39,830
How big should I make it?

359
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,998
John...

360
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,466
What?

361
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,069
Y'all might have treated me like a fool,

362
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:47,470
but I am not useless.

363
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:53,343
I can draw a damn...
whatever it is... a sigil.

364
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,013
Why don't you go help Sam out?

365
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,349
Okay, 'cause this has
got to be done in...

366
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,484
it's got to be done in human blood.

367
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,268
So, how big?

368
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,770
I'll show you.

369
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:24,938
What?

370
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:31,645
All of a sudden, you... you
really remind me of my dad.

371
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:51,029
That's really good.

372
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:54,666
You come to check on me?

373
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:57,035
Uh...

374
00:21:57,069 --> 00:21:59,470
I wanted to say I-I'm
sorry about all this.

375
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,141
I-I know it's a lot.

376
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:03,243
Look, how long have you known

377
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:07,246
about this... hunting stuff?

378
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:09,715
Pretty much forever.

379
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:11,416
My dad raised me in it.

380
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,184
You're serious?

381
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:16,687
Who the hell does that to a kid?

382
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:20,256
Well, I mean, for the record,
Mary's parents did.

383
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,523
I don't care.

384
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:23,859
You know, what kind
of irresponsible bastard

385
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:25,794
Lets a child anywhere near...

386
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,929
Y-you know, you
could've been killed!

387
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:31,266
I, uh... came kind of close.

388
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,101
The number it must've
done on your head...

389
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:38,238
Your father was
supposed to protect you.

390
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:40,973
He was trying.

391
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:45,176
He died trying.

392
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:50,179
Believe me...

393
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:56,150
I used to be mad at him.

394
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:58,685
I-I mean, I used to...

395
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,021
I used to hate the guy,

396
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:03,557
but now I-I...

397
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,858
I get it.

398
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:08,628
He was... Just doing
the best he could.

399
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:11,030
And he was trying
to keep it together

400
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:14,433
In... in... in this impossible situation.

401
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:19,704
See...

402
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:23,209
My mom, um...

403
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:25,912
She was amazing, beautiful,

404
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,182
and... she was the
love of his life.

405
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,818
And she got killed,

406
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:35,454
and... I think

407
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:38,223
he would have gone crazy
if he didn't do something.

408
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:44,628
Truth is, um...

409
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,730
my dad died

410
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:49,265
before I got to tell him that...

411
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,768
I understand...

412
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:58,172
why he did what he did,

413
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:01,475
and I forgive him
for what it did to us.

414
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:02,842
I do.

415
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,811
And I just...

416
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,048
I love him.

417
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:26,395
Uriel.

418
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,365
- You look well.
- - You shouldn't have called.

419
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,269
We're under strict orders
not to come down here,

420
00:24:36,304 --> 00:24:38,238
much less take a vessel.

421
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:43,876
You're not the Anna of now.

422
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,179
No, but 30 years from now,
I'm still your superior.

423
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:51,515
I need you to kill some humans.

424
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,017
Always happy to do some smiting.

425
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:55,886
But what's going on?

426
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,255
In the future, these people
are going to kill you, Uriel.

427
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:04,226
I'm giving you the chance
to kill them first.

428
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,995
Thank you.

429
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:13,899
Okay.

430
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:17,469
You said you'd explain
everything when we had a minute.

431
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:19,238
We have a minute.

432
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:21,308
Why does an angel want me dead?

433
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:27,379
'cause they're dicks.

434
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,714
Not good enough.

435
00:25:29,748 --> 00:25:34,218
I didn't even know they existed,
and now I'm a target?

436
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:35,919
It's complicated.

437
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:38,054
Fine.

438
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,223
All ears.

439
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:46,995
You're just gonna have to trust me, okay?

440
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,064
I've been trusting you all day.

441
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:51,900
It's kind of hard to believe.

442
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,536
All right, then. I'm
walking out the door.

443
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,670
I'm your son.

444
00:25:58,373 --> 00:25:59,572
What?

445
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:07,110
I'm your son.

446
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:09,478
Sorry. I don't know how else to say it.

447
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:13,282
We're from the year 2010.

448
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:16,951
An angel zapped us back here...

449
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:19,953
not the one that
attacked you, friendlier.

450
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:23,923
You can't expect
me to believe that.

451
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:30,129
Our names are Dean
and Sam Winchester.

452
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:34,099
We're named after your parents.

453
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,935
When I would get sick,

454
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:41,071
you would make
me tomato-rice soup,

455
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:44,607
because that's what
your mom made you,

456
00:26:44,642 --> 00:26:48,244
and instead of a lullaby...

457
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:50,045
You would sing "Hey Jude"...

458
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:54,048
...'cause that's your
favorite Beatles song.

459
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:58,185
I...

460
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,454
I don't believe it.

461
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:02,389
No.

462
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:03,923
I'm sorry, but it's true.

463
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:10,129
I raised my kids to be hunters?

464
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:12,765
No. No, you didn't.

465
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,767
How could I do that to you?

466
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,803
You didn't do it...

467
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,573
because you're dead.

468
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,146
What? What happened?

469
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:30,649
Yellow-eyed demon.

470
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:35,287
He killed you, and...

471
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,992
John became a hunter to get revenge.

472
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,929
He raised us in this life.

473
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,934
Listen to me.

474
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,370
A demon comes
into Sam's nursery

475
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,505
exactly six months
after he's born...

476
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,206
November 2, 1983,

477
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:58,874
remember that date

478
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:01,409
and whatever you do...

479
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,777
do not go in there.

480
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:06,112
You wake up that morning and
you take Sam and you run.

481
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:08,146
That's not good enough, Dean.

482
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:13,483
Wherever she goes,
the demon's gonna find her...

483
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,352
Find me.

484
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:18,054
Well, then what?

485
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:23,093
She can leave dad. That's what.

486
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,165
You got to leave John.

487
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,266
What?

488
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,635
When this is all over, walk away...

489
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,036
and never look back.

490
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,540
So we're never born. He's right.

491
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:40,409
I-I can't.

492
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:43,745
You're saying that
you're my children,

493
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,013
and now you're saying...

494
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:46,514
You have no other choice.

495
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:49,416
There's a big difference between
dying and never being born.

496
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,983
and trust me, we're okay with it,
I promise you that.

497
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:53,384
Okay, well, I'm not.

498
00:28:53,418 --> 00:28:55,885
Listen, you think you can
have that normal life

499
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,853
that you want so bad... but you can't.

500
00:28:58,888 --> 00:28:59,921
I'm sorry.

501
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,088
It's all gonna go rotten.

502
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:04,990
You are gonna die,

503
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:08,191
and your children will be cursed.

504
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:16,431
There... there has to be a way.

505
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:17,599
No, this is the way

506
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:19,401
leave John.

507
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:20,669
I can't.

508
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:23,805
This is bigger than us.

509
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,207
There are so many
more lives at stake...

510
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:29,177
You don't understand. I can't.

511
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,847
It's too late.

512
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,284
I'm...

513
00:29:39,354 --> 00:29:41,822
I'm pregnant.

514
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:46,092
Hey, we got a problem.

515
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:49,193
Those blood things,
the sigils, they're gone.

516
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:50,594
Gone as in...

517
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:52,428
I-I drew one on the back of
the door, I turned around

518
00:29:52,461 --> 00:29:55,263
and when I looked back again,
it was a smudge.

519
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:01,102
He's right.

520
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:03,470
There's no more holy oil.

521
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,547
Who the hell are you?

522
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:41,281
I'm Uriel.

523
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:43,383
Oh, come on.

524
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:44,417
Go.

525
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:51,592
Here goes nothin'.

526
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:17,784
John!

527
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:36,169
Sammy!

528
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:50,710
Sam!

529
00:32:02,116 --> 00:32:05,150
I'm really sorry.

530
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:08,151
Anna...

531
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:13,389
Michael.

532
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:40,279
Michael...

533
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:44,650
I didn't know.

534
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:46,952
Goodbye, Uriel.

535
00:32:50,957 --> 00:32:52,391
W-what did you do to John?

536
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:54,159
John is fine.

537
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:55,560
Who... what are you?

538
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:59,797
Shh...

539
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:12,074
Well, I'd say this
conversation is long overdue,

540
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:13,975
- wouldn't you?
- Fix him.

541
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,144
First...

542
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:18,645
we talk.

543
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,048
Then I fix your darling little Sammy.

544
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:25,718
How'd you get in my dad, anyway?

545
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:29,821
I told him I could save
his wife, and he said yes.

546
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,258
I guess they oversold me

547
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:36,228
being your one and only vessel.

548
00:33:36,262 --> 00:33:39,031
You're my true vessel
but not my only one.

549
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:40,399
What is that supposed to mean?

550
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:41,733
It's a bloodline.

551
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:42,901
A bloodline?

552
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:45,070
Stretching back to Cain and Abel.

553
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:47,372
It's in your blood,
your father's blood,

554
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:49,107
your family's blood.

555
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:52,310
Awesome.

556
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:54,679
Six degrees of heaven bacon.

557
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:57,114
What do you want with me?

558
00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:59,082
You really don't know
the answer to that?

559
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:01,084
Well, you know I ain't gonna
say yes, so why are you here?

560
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:03,453
What do you want with me?!

561
00:34:03,487 --> 00:34:08,325
I just want you to understand
what you and I have to do.

562
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:10,226
Oh, I get it.

563
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:12,695
You got beef with your brother

564
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,866
well, get some therapy, pal.
Don't take it out on my planet!

565
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:18,570
You're wrong.

566
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:24,274
Lucifer defied our father,
and he betrayed me.

567
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:25,875
But still...

568
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,278
I don't want this any more than
you would want to kill Sam.

569
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:38,753
You know, my brother,
I practically raised him.

570
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,821
I took care of him

571
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:43,424
In a way most people
could never understand,

572
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,459
and I still love him.

573
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,164
But I am going to kill him

574
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:53,299
because it is right and I have to.

575
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,301
- Oh, because god says so?
- Yes.

576
00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:56,935
From the beginning,

577
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,372
he knew this was how
it was going to end.

578
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:03,307
And you're just gonna
do whatever god says.

579
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:05,809
Yes, because I am a good son.

580
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,946
Okay, well trust me, pal

581
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,115
take it from someone who knows...

582
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:12,349
that is a dead-end street.

583
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:15,418
And you think you know
better than my father?

584
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:17,453
One unimportant little man...

585
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:20,155
what makes you think
you get to choose?

586
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,325
Because I got to believe
that I can choose what I do

587
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:28,695
with my... unimportant little life.

588
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:32,130
You're wrong.

589
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,831
You know how I know?

590
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:45,178
Think of a million
random acts of chance

591
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:47,947
that let John and Mary be born,

592
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:52,384
to meet, to fall in love,
to have the two of you.

593
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:56,222
Think of the million random
choices that you make...

594
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:58,357
and yet how each and
every one of them

595
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:00,359
brings you closer to your destiny.

596
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:06,032
Do you know why that is?

597
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:11,704
Because it's not random. It's not chance.

598
00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:16,508
It's a plan that is playing
itself out perfectly.

599
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,278
Free will's an illusion, Dean.

600
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,015
That's why you're going to say yes.

601
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:29,150
Oh, buck up.

602
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:30,552
It could be worse.

603
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:32,019
You know, unlike my brothers,

604
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:35,522
I won't leave you a drooling
mess when I'm done wearing you.

605
00:36:35,556 --> 00:36:36,756
Well, what about my dad?

606
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,191
Better than new.

607
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:41,594
In fact, I'm gonna do your
mom and your dad a favor.

608
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:43,062
What?

609
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:45,096
Scrub their minds.

610
00:36:45,131 --> 00:36:47,831
They won't remember me or you.

611
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:49,399
You can't do that.

612
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:52,268
I'm just giving your
mother what she wants.

613
00:36:52,303 --> 00:36:54,870
She can go back to her
husband, her family...

614
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:56,871
She's gonna walk right into that nursery!

615
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:59,774
Obviously.

616
00:36:59,808 --> 00:37:02,876
And you always knew that
was going to play out

617
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,979
one way or another.

618
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:12,751
You can't fight city hall.

619
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:32,299
He's home...

620
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,401
Safe and sound.

621
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:36,736
Your turn.

622
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:41,838
I'll see you soon, Dean.

623
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,337
Castiel.

624
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:01,038
Hey. Hey, hey. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

625
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,373
- Cass!
- We got you.

626
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,274
You son of a bitch. You made it.

627
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,375
I...

628
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:08,144
I did?

629
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,246
I'm very surprised.

630
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,117
- Whoa! You're okay.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

631
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:14,318
- Bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

632
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,723
Whoa.

633
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:23,094
Well, I could use that drink now.

634
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:24,161
Yeah.

635
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:26,597
Well...

636
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:29,065
This is it.

637
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,266
This is what?

638
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:32,934
Team free will.

639
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:35,003
One ex-blood junkie,

640
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:37,205
one drop-out with 6 bucks to his name,

641
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,973
and Mr. Comatose over there.

642
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:40,041
It's awesome.

643
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:41,509
It's not funny.

644
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:44,144
I'm not laughing.

645
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:51,116
They all say we'll say yes.

646
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,717
I know. It's getting annoying.

647
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,952
What if they're right?

648
00:38:54,986 --> 00:38:56,753
They're not.

649
00:38:56,788 --> 00:39:00,291
I mean, w-why... why
would we, either of us?

650
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:01,659
But...

651
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:03,627
I've been weak before.

652
00:39:03,662 --> 00:39:05,095
Sam...

653
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,363
Michael got dad to say yes.

654
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:08,398
That was different.

655
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:09,799
Anna was about to kill mom.

656
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:12,435
And if you could save mom...

657
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:14,204
what would you say?

658
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:20,642
Where'd you even get it?

659
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:23,945
Garage sale. 25 cents.

660
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:26,246
Well, I'm glad to hear that, anyway.

661
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,148
Hey.

662
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:29,984
I mean, you really don't think

663
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:32,152
It's just a-a little cheesy?

664
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:35,988
Mnh-mnh. I think it's sweet.

665
00:39:38,691 --> 00:39:41,292
Can't even put my finger on why I like it.

666
00:39:41,326 --> 00:39:43,659
I just...

667
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:45,494
like it.

668
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:49,899
Well, then, I love it.

669
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:59,343
Ohh...

670
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:02,713
Quite a kick there.

671
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:05,216
Troublemaker already.

672
00:40:07,052 --> 00:40:11,688
It's okay, baby. It's all okay.

673
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:15,057
Angels are watching over you.
