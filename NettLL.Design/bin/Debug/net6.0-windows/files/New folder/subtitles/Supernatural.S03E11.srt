1
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,770
Back in 1835,samuel colt made a gun.

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,490
They say this gun can kill anything.

3
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,700
Bela talbot's her real name.

4
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,860
Is she a hunter?

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,700
She's pretty freaking far from a hunter.

6
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,965
The colt. bela stole the colt.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,525
I need your help. help with what?

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,420
- With Sam.
- You need to help me get him ready

9
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,670
To fight this war on his own.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,860
Rise and shine,sammy!

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,530
Asia
Dude. asia?

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,260
Come on. you love this song and you know it.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,960
Yeah,and if I ever hear it again,
I'm gonna kill myself.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,440
What?

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,740
Sorry. I can't hear you.

16
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,660
Whenever you're ready,dean.

17
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,450
This yours?

18
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,830
Bingo.

19
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,160
Now,who's ready for some breakfast?

20
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,160
Drive safely now,mr. pickett.

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,760
Yeah,yeah.

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,930
Can't stay unless you order something,cal.

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,470
You know the rules.

24
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,730
Some coffee.

25
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,460
Hey. tuesday. pig 'n a poke.

26
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,260
Do you even know what that is?

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,250
Are you boys ready? yes.

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,300
I'll have the special, a side
of bacon, and a coffee.

29
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,260
Make it two coffees and a short stack.

30
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,750
You got it.

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,225
I'm telling you,sam,this job is small-fry.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,875
We should be spending our
time hunting down bela.

33
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,700
Okay,sure. let's get right on that.
where is she again? shut up.

34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,760
Believe me,I want to find her
as bad as you do.

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,030
In the meantime,we have this.

36
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,960
All right,so this professor...

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,060
Dexter hasselback. he was passing through
town last week when he vanished.

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,630
Last known location?

39
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,100
His daughter says he was on his way

40
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,420
To visit the broward county mystery spot.

41
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,780
"where the laws of physics
have no meaning!"?

42
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,300
Two coffees -- black,

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,400
And some hot sauce for the...

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,900
Whoops.

45
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,850
Crap. sorry.

46
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,030
Clean up!

47
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,100
Sam,you know joints like this

48
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,220
Are only tourist traps,right?

49
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,230
I mean,you know,balls rolling uphill,

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,730
Furniture nailed to the ceiling.

51
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,030
The only danger's to your wallet.

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,940
Okay,look. I'm just saying
there are spots in the world

53
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,350
Where holes open up and swallow people --

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,430
The bermuda triangle,the oregon vortex.

55
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,860
Broward county mystery spot?

56
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,400
Well,sometimes these places are legit.

57
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,700
All right,so if it is legit --

58
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,430
And that's a big-ass "if"
what's the lore?

59
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,330
Well -- excuse me.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,870
The lore's pretty freaking nuts,actually.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,900
I mean,they say these places,

62
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,470
The magnetic fields are so strong

63
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,300
That they can bend space-time,

64
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,330
Sending victims no one knows where.

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,200
Sounds a little "x files" to me.

66
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,630
I told you it wouldn't fit!

67
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,100
What do you want,a pulitzer?

68
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,960
All right,look,I'm not saying
this is really happening,

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,460
But if it is,we got to check it out,

70
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,630
See if we can do something.

71
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,700
All right,all right.

72
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,750
We'll go tonight after they close,

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,260
Get ourselves a nice,long look.

74
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,520
Wow. uncanny.

75
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,290
Find anything?

76
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,570
No.

77
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,220
Do you have any idea
what you're looking for?

78
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,410
Uh...yeah.

79
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,790
No.

80
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,710
What the hell you doing here?

81
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,900
Whoa,whoa,whoa. we can explain.

82
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,960
You robbing me?

83
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,630
Look,nobody's robbing you. calm down.

84
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,440
Don't move. don't move!

85
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,990
I'm just putting the gun down.

86
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,370
Dean!

87
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,460
?911
Call 911.

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I -- I didn't mean...

89
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,360
Now!

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,960
No. no. no.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,260
Not like this.

92
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,880
Dean.

93
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,820
supernatural season 3 episode 11

94
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,730
Rise and shine,sammy!

95
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,930
Asia
Dude. asia.

96
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,860
Dean.

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,860
Oh,come on.

98
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,540
You love this song and you know it.

99
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,390
What?

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,450
I don't know.

101
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,330
You all right?

102
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,750
No. I think i...

103
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,410
Man,I had a weird dream.

104
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,740
Yeah? clowns or midgets?

105
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,490
Drive safely now,mr. pickett.

106
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,850
Yeah,yeah.

107
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,940
Can't stay unless you order something,cal.

108
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,240
You know the rules.

109
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,040
Coffee.

110
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,520
Hey. tuesday.

111
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,780
Pig 'n a poke.

112
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,260
It's tuesday?

113
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,730
Yeah.

114
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,880
Are you boys ready? yes.

115
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,570
I'll have the special,side of bacon,and a coffee.

116
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,570
Uh,nothing for me. thanks.

117
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,990
Let me know if you change your mind.

118
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,665
I'm telling you,sam,this job is small-fry.

119
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,650
We should be spending our time hunting down bela.

120
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,050
You with me?

121
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,160
What?

122
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,440
You sure you feel okay?

123
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,460
You don't...

124
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,960
You don't remember any of this?

125
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,930
Remember what?

126
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,430
This. today.

127
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,130
Like -- like it's -- like it's happened before?

128
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,360
You mean like Deja vu?

129
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,090
No. I mean like it's --

130
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,030
Like it's really happened before.

131
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,650
Yeah. like Deja vu.

132
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,540
No. forget about Deja vu.

133
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,290
I'm asking you if it feels like --

134
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,650
Like we're living yesterday all over again.

135
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
Okay,how is that not Deja vu-- don't!

136
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,950
Don't say it! just don't even...

137
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,300
Coffee -- black,

138
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,530
And some hot sauce for the...

139
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,730
Whoops! crap.

140
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,070
Thanks!

141
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,670
Nice reflexes.

142
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,610
Sam,I'm sorry.

143
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,090
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

144
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,960
Okay,look. yesterday was tuesday,right?

145
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,340
But today is tuesday,too.

146
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,470
Yeah. no. good. you're totally balanced.

147
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,000
So you don't believe me?

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,280
Excuse me.

149
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,190
Look, I'm just saying
that it's crazy, you know?

150
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,490
Even-for-us crazy. dingo-ate-my-baby crazy.

151
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,650
Hey,maybe it was another one
of your psychic premonitions.

152
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,340
No. no way. way too vivid.

153
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,670
Okay,look. we were at the
mystery spot,and then...

154
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,810
And then what?

155
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,630
Then I woke up.

156
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,040
I told you it wouldn't fit!

157
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you want,a pulitzer?

158
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,870
Wait a minute! the mystery spot.

159
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,900
You think maybe it...

160
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,980
Maybe what?

161
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,830
We got to check that place out.

162
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,760
Just go with me on this.

163
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,760
All right. all right.

164
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
We'll go tonight after close,

165
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,760
Get ourselves a nice,long look.

166
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,860
Wait. what?

167
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,350
No. why not?

168
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,870
Uh...let's just go now.

169
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,790
Right now. business hours.

170
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,830
Nice and crowded.

171
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,690
My god,you're a freak.

172
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,630
Dean.

173
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,410
Okay! whatever. we'll go now.

174
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,620
Dean!

175
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,560
Dean. no. no. no.

176
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,200
Come on. dean.

177
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,410
Hey. dean.

178
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,130
Dean. dean.

179
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,620
Rise and shine,sammy!

180
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,400
Hey. tuesday. pig 'n a poke.

181
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,290
Would you listen to me,dean?
cause I am flipping out.

182
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,520
Are you boys ready?

183
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,630
He'll take the special,
side of bacon, coffee black.

184
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,730
Nothing for me. thanks.

185
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,010
You got it.

186
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,510
Sammy,I get all tingly when
you take control like that.

187
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,970
Quit screwing around,dean.

188
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Okay. okay. I'm listening. so...so...

189
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,940
Now,you think that you're
in some kind of a what?

190
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,020
Time loop.

191
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,920
Like "groundhog day."

192
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,860
Yes. exactly. like "groundhog day."

193
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,650
So you don't believe me?

194
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,470
It's it's a little crazy.
even-for-us crazy.

195
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,070
You know,like...

196
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,610
...dingo-ate-my-baby crazy?

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,080
How'd you know I was gonna say that?

198
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,390
Because you've said it before, dean.
that's my whole point.

199
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,650
Coffee -- black,

200
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,570
And some hot sauce for the...

201
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,300
Whoops! crap.

202
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,360
Thanks.

203
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,220
Nice reflexes.

204
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,100
No. I knew it was gonna happen.

205
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,530
Okay,look.

206
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,230
I'm sure that there's some
sort of an explanation.

207
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,820
You're just gonna have to go
with me on this,all right,dean?

208
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,680
You just have to. you owe me that much.

209
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,040
Calm down. don't tell me to calm down!

210
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,570
I can't calm down. I can't because...

211
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,990
Because what?

212
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,580
Because you die today,dean.

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,750
I'm not gonna die. not today.

214
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,920
Twice now,I've watched you die.

215
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,060
And I can't.

216
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,590
I won't do it again,okay?

217
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,330
And you're just gonna have to believe me.

218
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,560
Please.

219
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,240
All right.

220
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,160
I still think you're nuts,but...

221
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,760
Okay. whatever this is,we'll figure it out.

222
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,840
Excuse me.

223
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,460
I told you it wouldn't fit!

224
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,650
What do you want,a pulitzer?

225
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,470
And you think this cheesy-ass tourist trap

226
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,290
Has something to do with it.

227
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,510
Maybe it's the real deal,you know?

228
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,970
The the magnetic fields bending
space-time or whatever.

229
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,020
That all seems a little
too "x files" for me.

230
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,600
Well,I don't know how else
to explain it,dean!

231
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,550
All right! all right.

232
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,850
We'll go tonight after they close,

233
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,100
Get ourselves a nice,long look.

234
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,490
No,no,no,no. we can't.

235
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,660
Why not?

236
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,670
Because you...

237
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,450
I what?

238
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,980
I die there?

239
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,050
Blown away,actually.

240
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,320
Okay. let's go now.

241
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,090
Get out of the way!

242
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,290
What,did he...

243
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,910
Yesterday. yeah.

244
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,380
And?

245
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,120
And what?

246
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,850
Did it look cool like in the movies?

247
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,720
You peed yourself.

248
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,080
Of course I peed myself.

249
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,870
A man gets hit by a car,

250
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,650
You think he has full control
over his bladder?

251
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,820
Come on!

252
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,100
Boys,I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

253
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,730
We could use all the good ink we can get.

254
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,660
How long have you owned
the place,mr. carpiak?

255
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,760
Well,my family's been guarding
the secrets here

256
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,330
Since you don't want to know when.

257
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,270
So you'd know if anything strange happened?

258
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,660
Strange?

259
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,850
Strange happens here all the time.

260
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,420
It's a mystery spot.

261
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,490
What exactly does that mean?

262
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,780
Well,uh...

263
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,560
It's where the laws of physics...

264
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,760
Have no meaning.

265
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,560
Okay. like how?

266
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,650
Take the tour.

267
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,680
The guy who went missing
dexter hasselback

268
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,730
He take the tour?

269
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,690
Hold on a minute.
what kind of article is this?

270
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,170
Just answer the question.

271
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,020
The police scoured every inch of this place.

272
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,950
They couldn't find that man.
I never seen him before.

273
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,960
- We're a family establishment.
- listen to me.

274
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,690
There's something weird going on here.

275
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,410
Now,do you know anything about it or not?

276
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,250
Okay,look.

277
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,750
Guys,um,give it a break.

278
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,040
I bought the joint at a foreclosure auction

279
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,670
Last march,all right?

280
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,900
Hell,I used to sell bail bonds.

281
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,850
Okay,kojak. let's get some air.

282
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,160
I hate to say it,but that place

283
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,290
Is exactly what I thought
it's full of crap.

284
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,120
So what is it,then,dean?

285
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,390
What the hell is happening to us?

286
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,760
I don't know.

287
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,290
All right,let me just...

288
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,580
So,every day I die.

289
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,690
Yeah.

290
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,750
That's when you wake up again,right?

291
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,850
Yeah.

292
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,640
So let's just make sure I don't die.

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,970
If I make it to tomorrow,

294
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,410
Then maybe the loop stops
and we can figure all this out.

295
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,830
Do you think?

296
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,180
It's worth a shot.

297
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,270
I say we grab some takeout,
head back to the motel,

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,630
Lay low until midnight.

299
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:28,960
All right,good.

300
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,330
Who wants chinese?

301
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,940
Rise and shine,sammy!

302
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,050
i still think you're nuts.

303
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,960
But whatever this is,we'll figure it out.

304
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,660
Thanks.

305
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,520
So,uh...

306
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,540
If you're stuck in "groundhog day," why?

307
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,810
What's behind it?

308
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,460
First I thought it was the mystery spot.

309
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,820
Now I'm not so sure.

310
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,230
What do we do?

311
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,660
Well,we keep you breathing,
try to make it to tomorrow.

312
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,900
I mean,that's the only thing I can think of.

313
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,560
Shouldn't be too hard.

314
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,030
Yeah,right. dean,I've watched you
die a few times now,

315
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,530
And I can't ever seem to stop it.

316
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,030
Well,nothing's set in stone.

317
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
You say I order the same thing
every day,right?

318
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah. pig 'n a poke,side of bacon.

319
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,300
Excuse me,sweetheart.

320
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,530
Can I get sausage instead of bacon?

321
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,820
Sure thing,hon.

322
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,700
See? different day already.

323
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,310
You see,if you and I decide
that I am not gonna die,

324
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm not gonna die.

325
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Thank you.

326
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,530
Dean.

327
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,150
Dean.

328
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,930
You mean we can't even go out for breakfast?

329
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,900
You'll thank me when it's wednesday!

330
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,960
Whatever that means.

331
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,000
Do these tacos taste funny to you?

332
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,460
Everybody's fine. nobody's
gonna get hurt,okay?

333
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,640
Sammy?

334
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,730
Maybe you should drop the ax
and let this guy go.

335
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,900
What do you say?

336
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,860
Something's got to be going on here.

337
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,230
I intend to find out what.

338
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,300
Place is tore up pretty good,dude.

339
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,840
Time to give it a rest.

340
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,100
No!

341
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,160
I'm gonna take it down to studs.

342
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,960
Sammy,that's enough. give me the ax.

343
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,260
Give me the ax! this is crazy!

344
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,400
Leave it,dean!

345
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,560
Come on!

346
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,730
Get off!

347
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,330
Oh,my god,dean!

348
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,780
Drive safely now,mr. pickett.

349
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,250
Yeah,yeah.

350
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,320
Can't stay unless you order something,cal.

351
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,560
You know the rules.

352
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,900
Coffee.

353
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,460
Hey. tuesday. pig 'n a poke.

354
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,200
What are those?

355
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,700
The old man's.

356
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,460
Trust me. you don't want him
behind the wheel.

357
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,820
You boys ready?

358
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,620
Yes,we are.

359
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,860
I'll have the special, a side
of bacon, and a coffee.

360
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,160
Hey,doris.

361
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
What I'd like is for you to
log in some more hours

362
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,160
At the archery range.

363
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,030
- You're a terrible shot.
- how do you know

364
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,260
Lucky guess.

365
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,230
Okay,so,you think you're caught

366
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,500
In some kind of what again?

367
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,830
Time loop.

368
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,180
Like "groundhog day."

369
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,430
It doesn't matter. there's no way to stop it.

370
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,960
Jeez. aren't you grumpy?

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
Yeah,I am. you want to know why?

372
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,115
Why?

373
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,380
Because this is the 100th tuesday in a row

374
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,920
I've been through,and it never stops.

375
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,330
Ever. so,yeah,I'm a little grumpy.

376
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,430
Hot sauce.

377
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,000
What?

378
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,630
Coffee -- black,

379
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,860
And some hot sauce for the -- whoops!

380
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,130
Crap. thanks!

381
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,100
Nice reflexes.

382
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,050
I knew it was gonna happen,dean.

383
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,750
I know everything that's gonna happen.

384
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,230
You don't know everything.

385
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah. I do.

386
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,160
Yeah,right.yeah,right.

387
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Nice guess.nice guess.

388
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,060
It wasn't a guess.

389
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,030
Right,you're a mind reader.

390
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,130
Cut it out,sam.

391
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,460
Sam!sam!

392
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,630
You think you're being funny,

393
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,200
But you're being really,really childish.

394
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,530
Sam winchester wears makeup.

395
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,700
Sam winchester cries his way through sex.

396
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,500
Sam winchester keeps a ruler by the bed,

397
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,230
And every morning,when he wakes up...

398
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,430
Okay,enough!

399
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,100
That's not all.

400
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,430
Randy,the cashier?

401
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,270
He's skimming from the register.

402
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,100
Judge meyers?

403
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,470
At night,he puts on a furry bunny outfit.

404
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,760
Over there -- that's cal.

405
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,100
He's gonna rob tony the mechanic
on the way home.

406
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,400
What's your point?

407
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,280
My point is I've lived through
every possible tuesday.

408
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,300
I've watched you die every possible way.

409
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,880
I have ripped apart the mystery spot,

410
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,340
Burnt it down,tried everything
I know to save your life,

411
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,450
And I can't.

412
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,100
No matter what I do,you die,

413
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,050
And then I wake up.

414
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,160
And then it's tuesday again.

415
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,760
The dog.

416
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,420
There's got to be some way out of this.

417
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,660
"where's my dang keys?"

418
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,000
Where's my dang keys?

419
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,960
"excuse me."

420
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,310
Excuse me.

421
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,020
She's kind of cute.

422
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,360
All the times we've walked down this street,

423
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,660
I ever do this?

424
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,430
Excuse me. miss?

425
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,060
No.

426
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,930
100 tuesdays,you never bothered to check

427
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,730
What she was holding in her hands?

428
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,070
This the guy who went missing?

429
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,130
- Yeah. -that's his daughter back there.

430
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,930
Hey,buddy. somebody need a friend?

431
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,360
So,the police report says dexter hasselback

432
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,940
Is a professor,but that's not all he is.

433
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,970
What is he?

434
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,890
I talked to his daughter.
the guy's quite the journalist.

435
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,300
Columns in magazines,a blog.

436
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,700
He writes about tourist attractions --

437
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,160
Mystery spots,ufo crash sites.

438
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,660
He gets his kicks debunking them.

439
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,160
I mean,he's already put four
of these places out of business.

440
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,260
Here.

441
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,430
Truth warrior"?

442
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,260
More like a pompous schmuck,you ask me.

443
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,530
Yeah. tell me about it.

444
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,070
I mean,I've read everything
the guy's ever written.

445
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,930
He must have weighed a ton,
he was so full of himself.

446
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,700
When did you have time
to do all this research?

447
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,240
Come on.

448
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,430
What?

449
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,700
It's funny,you know.

450
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,900
I mean,this guy spends his whole life

451
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,080
Crapping on mystery spots
and then he vanishes in one.

452
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,100
It's kind of poetic,you know?
like just desserts.

453
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,200
You're right. that is just deserts.

454
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,650
What's wrong?

455
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,560
Guy has maple syrup
for the past 100 tuesdays --

456
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,730
All of a sudden,he's having strawberry?

457
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,930
It's a free country.

458
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,530
Man can't choose his own syrup,huh?

459
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
What have we become?

460
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,000
Not in this diner. not today.

461
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,760
Nothing in this place ever changes -- ever.

462
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,400
Except me.

463
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,830
Rise and shine,sammy!

464
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,360
So,you think you're caught
in some kind of what again?

465
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,160
Eat your breakfast.

466
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,260
What's in the bag?

467
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,500
Hey!

468
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,830
- Hey.
-I know who you are.

469
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,100
Or should I say "what"?

470
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,230
- Oh,my god. please,don't kill me.
-uh,sam...

471
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,760
- It took me a hell of a long time,
but I got it. -what?

472
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,230
It's your m.o. that gave you away.

473
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,300
Going after pompous jerks,
giving them their just deserts.

474
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,560
Your kind loves that,don't they?

475
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,900
Yeah,sure. okay.

476
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,100
Just put the stake down.

477
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,500
- Sam, maybe you should
- no!

478
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,430
There's only one creature powerful enough

479
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,560
To do what you're doing --

480
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,030
Making reality out of nothing,

481
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,530
Sticking people in time loops.

482
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,900
In fact,you'd pretty much have to be a god.

483
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,060
You'd have to be a trickster.

484
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,900
Mister,my name is ed coleman.
my wife's name's amelia.

485
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,930
I got two kids.

486
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,300
For crying out loud,I sell ad space!

487
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,560
Don't lie to me! I know what you are!

488
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,500
We've killed one of your kind before!

489
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,160
Actually,bucko,you didn't.

490
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,060
You're joking,right?

491
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,630
You chuckleheads tried to kill me last time.

492
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,700
Why wouldn't I do this?

493
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,460
And hasselback -- what about him?

494
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,660
That putz?

495
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,730
He said he didn't believe in wormholes,

496
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,330
So I dropped him in one.

497
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,930
Then you guys showed up.

498
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,560
I made you the second you hit town.

499
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,560
So this is fun for you?

500
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,560
Killing dean over and over again?

501
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
One -- yes,it is fun,

502
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,530
And two this is so not about killing dean.

503
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,430
This joke is on you,sam.

504
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,060
Watching your brother die every day.

505
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,760
Forever.

506
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,330
You son of a bitch.

507
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,430
How long will it take you to realize

508
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,200
You can't save your brother...

509
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,060
...no matter what?

510
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Oh,yeah?

511
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,000
I kill you,this all ends now.

512
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,330
Oh,hey! whoa. okay.

513
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,130
Okay. look.

514
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,930
I was just playing around.

515
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,630
You can't take a joke,fine.
you're out of it.

516
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,060
Tomorrow,you wake up,it'll be wednesday.

517
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,000
I swear.

518
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,360
You're lying.

519
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,260
If I am,you know where to find me --

520
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,230
Having pancakes at the diner.

521
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,360
No. easier to just kill you.

522
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,230
Sorry,kiddo. can't have that.

523
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,800
- What,are you gonna sleep all day? -no asia.

524
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,760
Yeah,I know. this station sucks.

525
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,000
It's wednesday!

526
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,500
Yeah,which usually comes after tuesday.

527
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,130
Turn that thing off,would you?

528
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,600
What,are you kidding?

529
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,900
- This isn't the most beautiful
song you've ever heard? -no.

530
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,100
Jeez. how many tuesdays did you have?

531
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,830
I don't know. I lost count.

532
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,030
Hey,wait. what do you remember?

533
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,160
I remember you were pretty
whacked out of it yesterday,

534
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Then I remember running into the trickster.

535
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,560
But,no,that's about it.

536
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,030
All right. pack your stuff.

537
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,830
Let's get the hell out of town -- now.

538
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,860
No breakfast?

539
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,360
No breakfast.

540
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,230
Are you sure we should
just let the trickster go?

541
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,800
Give me your wallet.

542
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,500
Whoa,whoa,whoa,buddy. just relax.

543
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,260
I am relaxed!

544
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,660
Okay. all right.

545
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,330
Nobody wants this to end the wrong way.

546
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,460
Let's talk about it a sec.

547
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,830
Dean!

548
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,930
No. no,no,no,no.no no

549
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,760
Hey. hey. come on.

550
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,330
Not today. not today.

551
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,960
This isn't supposed to happen today.

552
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,200
Come on.

553
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm supposed to wake up.

554
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,530
This is sam. leave a message.

555
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,960
Sam,it's bobby.

556
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,600
Heard about that demon thing

557
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,660
You took care of in death valley.

558
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,300
Nice job.

559
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,900
It's been about three months
we talked,though.

560
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,930
It'd be nice to hear your voice.

561
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,700
Give a call. I'm here.

562
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,200
Sam? bobby again.

563
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,300
Look,I'm worried about you.

564
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,960
Just tell me you're not
sitting alone somewhere,

565
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,900
Obsessing over this damn trickster.

566
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,660
Call me,sam. we can find it together.

567
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,260
No one man should take
something like this on alone.

568
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,030
You hear me?

569
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,800
By the way,that vampire nest in austin --

570
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,300
Hell of a job.

571
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,200
Sam? it's bobby.

572
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,900
I found him.

573
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,130
It's good to see you,boy.

574
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,260
What are we doing here,bobby?

575
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,860
This is the last place,for sure,

576
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,400
the trickster worked his magic.

577
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,430
So?

578
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,330
So,you want this thing?

579
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,500
I found a summoning ritual
to bring the trickster here.

580
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,330
What do we need?

581
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,660
Blood.

582
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,600
How much blood?

583
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,430
Ritual says near a gallon.
it's got to be fresh,too.

584
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,130
Meaning we have to bleed a person dry.

585
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,900
And it's got to be tonight,

586
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,660
Or not for another 50 years.

587
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,500
Then let's go get some.

588
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,560
You break my heart,kid.

589
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,360
What?

590
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,360
I'm not gonna let you
murder an innocent man.

591
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,200
Then why'd you bring me here?

592
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,730
Why?

593
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,800
Cause it was the only way you'd see me.

594
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,530
Cause I'm trying to knock
some sense into you.

595
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,500
Because I thought you'd
back down from killing a man.

596
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,330
Well,you thought wrong.

597
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,060
Leave the stuff. I'll do it myself.

598
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,900
I told you,I'm not
gonna let you kill anyone.

599
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,260
It's none of your damn business what I do!

600
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,900
You want your brother back so bad...

601
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,900
...fine.

602
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,400
What are you talking about?

603
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,560
Better me than a civilian.

604
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,960
You're crazy,bobby. I'm not killing you.

605
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,730
Oh. now I'm the crazy one.

606
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,160
Look,sam.

607
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,730
I'm old.

608
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,860
I'm coming near the end of my trail.

609
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,600
But you can keep fighting,saving folk.

610
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,160
But you need your brother.

611
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
So let me give him back to you.

612
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,960
Bobby...

613
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,730
You and dean,you...

614
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,800
You boys are the closest
thing I have to family.

615
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,000
I want to do this.

616
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,400
Okay.

617
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,960
Good.

618
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,200
Just make it quick.

619
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,230
Do it,son.

620
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,460
Yeah,okay,bobby.

621
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,130
But you want to know why?

622
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,700
Because you're not bobby.

623
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,330
Bobby.

624
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,330
Bobby.

625
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,730
Bobby!

626
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,100
You're right. I was just screwing with you.

627
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:43,260
Pretty good,though,sam. smart.

628
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,030
Let me tell ya.

629
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,330
Whoever said dean was the dysfunctional one

630
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,060
Has never seen you with
a sharp object in your hands.

631
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,230
Holy "full metal jacket."

632
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,230
Bring him back.

633
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,030
Who? dean?

634
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,600
Didn't my girl send you the flowers?

635
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,660
Dean's dead. he ain't coming back.

636
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,630
His soul's downstairs doing
the hellfire rumba as we speak.

637
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,730
Just take us back to
that tuesday or wednesday

638
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,330
When it all started,please.

639
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,160
We won't come after you. I swear.

640
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,060
You swear?

641
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,400
Yes.

642
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,700
I don't know.

643
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,300
Even if I could...

644
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,360
- You can. -true.

645
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,260
But that don't mean I should.

646
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,430
Sam,there's a lesson here

647
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,960
That I've been trying to drill

648
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,600
Into that freakish,
cro-magnon skull of yours.

649
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,230
Lesson? what lesson?

650
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,330
This obsession to save dean.

651
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,530
The way you two keep sacrificing
yourselves for each other.

652
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,800
Nothing good comes out of it.

653
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,730
Just blood and pain.

654
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,100
Dean's your weakness.

655
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,060
The bad guys know it,too.

656
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,300
He's gonna be the death of you,sam.

657
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sometimes you just got to let people go.

658
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,330
He's my brother.

659
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,700
Yep.

660
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,860
And like it or not,

661
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,460
This is what life's gonna
be like without him.

662
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,730
Please. just...

663
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,860
Please.

664
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,030
I swear,it's like talking to a brick wall.

665
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,760
Okay,look.

666
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,730
This all stopped being fun months ago.

667
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,960
You're travis bickel in a skirt,pal.

668
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,130
I'm over it.

669
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
Meaning what?

670
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,560
Meaning that's for me to
know and you to find out.

671
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,730
What,are you gonna sleep all day?

672
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,030
I know. no asia. this station sucks.

673
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,300
It's wednesday.

674
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,800
Yeah. which usually follows tuesday.

675
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,230
Turn that thing off.

676
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,130
Dude,how many tuesdays did you have?

677
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,500
Enough.

678
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,660
Wait.

679
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,630
What do you remember?

680
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,660
I remember you were pretty
whacked out yesterday.

681
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,560
I remember catching up with the trickster.

682
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,360
That's about it.

683
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,930
Let's go.

684
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,030
No breakfast?

685
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,560
No breakfast.

686
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,830
All right. I'll pack the car.

687
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,530
Wait. you're not going anywhere alone.

688
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,200
It's the parking lot,sam.

689
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,230
Just...

690
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,230
Just trust me.

691
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,200
Hey,you don't look so good.
something else happen?

692
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,730
I just had a really weird dream.

693
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,460
Clowns or midgets?
