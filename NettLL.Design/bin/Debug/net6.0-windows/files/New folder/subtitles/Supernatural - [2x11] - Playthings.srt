1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:01,955
Dad wants us to pick
up where he left off.

2
00:00:01,956 --> 00:00:03,894
Saving people, hunting things.

3
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,159
The family business.

4
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:08,357
Before dad died, he told me something.

5
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:10,358
Something about you.
What's did he tell you?

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,920
He said that I might
have to kill you, Sam.

7
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:13,344
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

8
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:14,112
I don't know.

9
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,513
Did he know the demon's plans for me?

10
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:17,320
Am I supposed to go
dark side or something?

11
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,919
Who are you? Please.

12
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:20,881
You're in danger.

13
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:22,418
What's your name? Ava Wilson.

14
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,670
You must be one of us. One of who?

15
00:00:24,678 --> 00:00:26,490
One of the psychics like me.

16
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,341
There are others like us out there,

17
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,142
And we're all part of something.

18
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:31,973
I'm not part of anything, okay?

19
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:32,693
Do you see this?

20
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,093
I am getting married in eight weeks.

21
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:36,563
You can't run from this,

22
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:38,123
And you can't protect me.

23
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:42,000
I can try.

24
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:44,071
Maybe I can help.
You've done all you can.

25
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:46,800
Just go back to your
fiancé. You'll be safe there.

26
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:48,613
Promise me you'll call, then.

27
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:49,961
I promise.

28
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:51,773
Ava...

29
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:17,092
Most of the stuff is up here.

30
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:19,221
Still can't believe
you're closing this house.

31
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:21,150
My parents got engaged here.

32
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,150
My grandparents too.

33
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:25,150
Yeah, a lot of people did.

34
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,080
Boxes are at the end of
the hall. Need any help?

35
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:29,470
No, ma'am. I got it.

36
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:38,131
He's gonna take our toys?

37
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:40,570
Only the ones you
don't play with anymore.

38
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:43,113
It's not like you don't
have enough already.

39
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:46,342
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.

40
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,750
Watch your mouth.

41
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,251
Maggie said it first.

42
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:50,781
Watch your mouth too, Maggie.

43
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,353
Good night, Tabitha.

44
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:03,851
Oh my god! Yes, yes are you there?

45
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:06,052
Please you have to send someone now.

46
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,223
There's been an accident.

47
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:11,263
A man fell down my stairs,
and I don't know if he's...

48
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,832
His head is like
completely turned around.

49
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:17,450
Tyler, don't look! Don't look!

50
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:18,882
Oh yes, yes!

51
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,122
As soon as possible.

52
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:27,193
Just hurry, please hurry!

53
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,152
I don't know, I didn't
see how it happened.

54
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:45,932
Yeah.

55
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:49,792
Okay. Thanks, Ellen.

56
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,831
What did she have to
say? She got nothing.

57
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:55,442
Me, I've been checking every
database I can think of,

58
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:57,003
Federal, state, and local.

59
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:59,321
No one's heard anything
about Ava. She's just...

60
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,060
Into thin air, you know?

61
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:03,101
What about you?

62
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,851
No, same as before. Sorry, man.

63
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:08,853
Ellen did have one thing.

64
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:11,952
A hotel in Cornwall, Connecticut,

65
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:14,123
Two freak accidents in
the past three weeks.

66
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,842
Yeah, what's that have to do with Ava?

67
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:17,512
It's a job.

68
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:19,420
I mean, a lady drowned in the bathtub,

69
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:21,603
Then a few days ago, a
guy falls down the stairs,

70
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,150
Head turns a complete 180,

71
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:25,121
Which isn't exactly normal, you know?

72
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:27,122
Look, I don't know,
Dean, it might be nothing,

73
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,343
But I told Ellen we'd
think about checking it out.

74
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:31,312
You did? Yeah.

75
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:36,141
You seem surprised. Yeah,
it's just, you know...

76
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,642
Not the patented Sam
Winchester way, is it?

77
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,570
What way is that?

78
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,523
Just figured after Ava,
there'd be, you know, more

79
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:49,073
Angst and droopy music and
staring out the rainy windows.

80
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,682
I'll shut up now.

81
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:53,951
Look,

82
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:56,273
I'm the one who told
her to go back home.

83
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,021
Now her fiancé's dead,

84
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:02,010
And some demon has taken
her off to god knows where,

85
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,303
You know?

86
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:06,292
We've been looking for a month now,

87
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:08,401
And we got nothing.

88
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,533
So I'm not giving up on her, but

89
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,693
I'm not gonna let
other people die either.

90
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:17,273
We got to save as many people as we can.

91
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:22,631
Wow, that attitude is just
way too healthy for me.

92
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:25,373
I'm officially
uncomfortable now. Thank you.

93
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,461
All right, call Ellen.
Tell her we'll take it.

94
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:46,590
Dude, this is sweet.

95
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,163
I never get to work jobs like this.

96
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:50,961
Like what?

97
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,851
Old-School haunted houses. You know,

98
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:56,981
Fog, secret passage ways,

99
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:59,053
Sissy  british accents.

100
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,372
Might even run into Fred and
Daphne while we're inside.

101
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:06,662
Daphne... Love her.

102
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:11,533
Hey, wait a sec.

103
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:15,363
I'm not so sure haunted's the problem.

104
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:16,541
What do you mean?

105
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:18,783
You see this pattern here?

106
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:22,460
That's a quincunx. It's a five-Spot.

107
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:24,911
Five-Spot. Yeah.

108
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,411
That's for hoodoo spellwork, isn't it?

109
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,081
Right. Hey, you fill
this thing with bloodweed,

110
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:30,191
You got a powerful charm
to ward off enemies.

111
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:31,891
Except I don't see any bloodweed.

112
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,973
Don't you think this
place is a little too

113
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:36,110
White-Meat for hoodoo?

114
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:39,122
Maybe.

115
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:46,193
May I help you?

116
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:49,163
Hi. Yeah, I'd like a room
for a couple of nights.

117
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:51,313
Hey!

118
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,461
Sorry about that. No problem.

119
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:58,092
Well, congratulations. You could
be some of our final guests.

120
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,491
Well, sounds vaguely ominous.

121
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:03,340
No, I'm sorry. I mean, we're
closing at the end of the month.

122
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,851
Let me guess. You guys
are here antiquing?

123
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:11,172
How'd you know? You just look the type.

124
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:13,042
So, a king-Size bed?

125
00:07:13,368 --> 00:07:15,402
What? No. No, no.

126
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:19,130
Two singles. We're just brothers.

127
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:22,483
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

128
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:27,010
What did you mean that
we looked the type?

129
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:29,783
You know,

130
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:32,700
Speaking of antiques, you have a really

131
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:34,672
Interesting urn on the front porch.

132
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:36,632
Where did you get that?
You know, I have no idea.

133
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:37,760
It's been there forever.

134
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:40,100
Here you go, Mr. Mahogoff.

135
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:43,672
You'll be staying in room 237.

136
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,861
Sherwin, could you show these
gentlemen to their rooms?

137
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:49,163
Let me guess...

138
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,030
Antiquers?

139
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:55,020
I can give you a hand with that bag.

140
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,570
I got it. Okay.

141
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:59,080
So the hotel's closing up, huh?

142
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,739
Yep. Miss Susan tried
to make a go of it,

143
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:03,871
But the guests just don't
come like they used to.

144
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:06,398
Still, it's a damn shame. Oh yeah?

145
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:10,183
It may not look it anymore,
but this place was a palace.

146
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:13,302
Two different vice-Presidents
laid their heads on our pillows.

147
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:16,972
My parents worked here. I
practically grew up here.

148
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:18,730
I'm gonna miss it.

149
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:20,822
Here's your room.

150
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:27,853
Thanks.

151
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:38,161
You're not gonna cheap
out on me, are you, boy?

152
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:48,560
What the...

153
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,581
What?

154
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:52,503
That's normal.

155
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:55,430
Why the hell would anyone stay here?

156
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,361
I'm amazed they kept
in business this long.

157
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:02,403
All right, victim number one,
Joan Edison, 43 years old,

158
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:04,891
A realtor handling
the sale of the hotel.

159
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:08,072
And victim number two
was Larry Williams,

160
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:09,890
Moving some stuff out to goodwill.

161
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,053
Well, there's a connexion. They're
both tied up in shutting the place down.

162
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,060
Yeah, maybe someone here
doesn't want to leave,

163
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:15,691
And they're using hoodoo to fight back.

164
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:17,790
Who do you think our witch
doctor is. This Susan lady?

165
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,103
Doesn't seem likely.

166
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:20,783
I mean, she's the one selling.

167
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:22,203
So, what then, Sherwin?

168
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,062
I don't know.

169
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:27,721
Of course, the most
troubling question is,

170
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:29,450
Why do these people assume we're gay?

171
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:30,852
You are kind of butch.

172
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,170
Probably think you're over compensating.

173
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:35,850
Right.

174
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,762
Hey.

175
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,892
Look at that. More hoodoo.

176
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:11,580
Hi, there. Hi.

177
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:12,943
Everything  okay with your room?

178
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:14,292
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

179
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,050
Yeah, everything's great. Good.

180
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,913
Well, I was just in the
middle of packing. So...

181
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:26,372
Hey, are those antique dolls?

182
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:28,763
'Cause this one, this one here,

183
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:30,913
He's got a major doll
collection back home.

184
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,423
Don't you? Huh?

185
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,931
Big time. Big time.

186
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,773
You think he could come in, well,
we could come in and take a look?

187
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,912
I don't know. Please?
I mean, he loves them.

188
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:44,970
He's not gonna tell you this,

189
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,130
But he's always dressing them
up in little tiny outfits.

190
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:50,430
You'd make his day. She would. Huh? Huh?

191
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,091
It's true.

192
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:56,640
Okay. Come on in. All right.

193
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:57,820
All right!

194
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:04,523
Wow.

195
00:11:05,507 --> 00:11:07,442
This is a lot of dolls.

196
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:11,180
They're nice, you know.
They're not supercreepy at all.

197
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:14,493
I suppose they are a little creepy.

198
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,181
But they've been in the family forever.

199
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,552
A lot of sentimental
value. What is this?

200
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,803
The hotel? Yeah, that's right.

201
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,382
Exact replica, custom-Built.

202
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,160
His head got twisted around.

203
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,671
What happened to it?

204
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,162
Tyler, probably.

205
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,473
Mommy.

206
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,383
Maggie's being mean.

207
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:43,813
Tyler, tell her I said to be nice, okay?

208
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:47,150
Hey, Tyler. I see you broke
your doll. You want me to fix it?

209
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:50,491
I didn't break it. I found it like that.

210
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,873
Well, maybe Maggie did it.
No, neither of us did it.

211
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,753
Grandma would get mad if we broke him.

212
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:58,970
Tyler, she wouldn't get mad. Grandma?

213
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:02,560
Grandma Rose. These were all her toys.

214
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:04,442
Oh, really?

215
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:06,501
Where's grandma Rose now?

216
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:08,171
Up in her room.

217
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:11,591
You know, I'd really
love to talk to Rose

218
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,401
About her incredible doll... No.

219
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,250
I  mean,

220
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,081
I'm  afraid that's impossible.

221
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:22,771
My mother's been very sick, and
she's not taking any visitors.

222
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:29,620
What do you think?

223
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,130
Dolls, hoodoo,

224
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:33,110
Mysterious shut-In grandma?

225
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:36,553
Well, dolls are used in all
kind of voodoo and hoodoo,

226
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:39,321
Like curses and binding spells.

227
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:41,390
Yeah, maybe we found our witch doctor.

228
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,743
I'll go see what I can dig upon granny.

229
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:46,373
You get online, check old obits,
freak accidents. That sort of things.

230
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,430
See if she's whacked
anybody before. Right.

231
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:50,970
Don't go surfing porn. It's
not the kind of whacking I mean.

232
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,123
I've been meaning to ask...

233
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:00,103
What sort of renovations
are you planning?

234
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:01,470
They never told you?

235
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,972
Told me what?

236
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,903
Miss Thompson, we plan
on demolishing the hotel.

237
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:09,170
Oh. I see.

238
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:11,732
Excuse me.

239
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:38,540
What happened?

240
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:43,012
The maid went into turn down
the sheets, and he was just

241
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,712
Hanging there. That's awful.

242
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,033
He was a guest?

243
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,990
He worked for the company
that bought the place.

244
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:53,932
I don't understand. What?

245
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:56,422
Had a lot of bad luck around here.

246
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:00,393
Look, if you'd like to check
out, I'll give you a full refund.

247
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:02,963
No, thanks. I don't scare that easy.

248
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:12,873
There's been another one.

249
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,673
Some guy just hung himself in his room.

250
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,501
Yeah. I saw.

251
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:19,102
We got figure this out and fast.

252
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:20,992
What did you find out about granny?

253
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:24,150
You're bossy.

254
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:26,873
What?

255
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,720
You're bossy.

256
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:32,142
You're short.

257
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:35,292
Are you drunk? Yeah.

258
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:37,160
So?

259
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,681
Stupid.

260
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:42,473
Dude, what are you thinking?
We're working a case.

261
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:49,042
That guy who hung himself...

262
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:53,263
I couldn't save him. What
are you talking about?

263
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:54,533
You didn't know. You
couldn't have done anything.

264
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,160
That's an excuse, Dean.

265
00:15:57,617 --> 00:15:59,911
I should have found a way to save him.

266
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,452
I should have saved Ava too.

267
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:06,302
Well, you can't save
everyone. Even you said that.

268
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,420
No, Dean, you don't
understand, all right?

269
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,090
The more people I save,
the more I can change.

270
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,702
Change what? My destiny, Dean.

271
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,480
All right, time for
bed. Come on, sasquatch.

272
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,501
Come on.

273
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:22,140
I need you to watch out
for me. Yeah, I always do.

274
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:25,260
No. No, no, no. You have
to watch out for me...

275
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,401
All right?

276
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:31,132
And if I ever turn into
something that I'm not...

277
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,931
You have to kill me. Sam...

278
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,391
Dean, dad told you
to do it. You have to.

279
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:40,982
Yeah, well, dad's an ass.

280
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,352
He never should have said
anything. I mean, you don't do that.

281
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,190
You don't lay that
kinda crap on your kids.

282
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,331
No, he was right to say it.

283
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:50,012
Who knows what I might become?

284
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,593
Even now, everyone around me dies.

285
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:55,070
Well, I'm not dying, okay?

286
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:56,753
And neither are you. Come on, sit down.

287
00:16:57,027 --> 00:17:00,551
No, please, Dean, you're
the only one who can do it.

288
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:02,643
Promise me. Don't ask that of me.

289
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:03,973
Dean, please.

290
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:05,860
You have to promise me.

291
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:13,120
I promise.

292
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:17,641
Thanks.

293
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:21,880
Thank you...

294
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,022
Find any good antiques?

295
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,753
No, no. Got distracted.

296
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:10,462
Have a drink.

297
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,273
Yeah, thanks.

298
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,902
So, poor guy, huh, killing himself?

299
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:24,063
That kind of thing seems
to be going around lately.

300
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,620
Yeah. Yeah, I heard
about the other ones.

301
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:30,242
It's almost like this hotel
is cursed or something.

302
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:32,920
Every hotel has its spilled blood.

303
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,111
If people only knew what's going on

304
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,290
In some of those rooms
they've checked into.

305
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:42,250
You know a lot about
the place, don't you?

306
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:44,063
Down to the last nail.

307
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,683
I'd love to hear some stories.

308
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:48,833
Boy,

309
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:51,780
You should never say that to an old man.

310
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:59,141
This is little miss Susan
and her mother, Rose.

311
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:01,020
Happier days.

312
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,110
They're not happy now?

313
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:10,092
Well, would you be, leaving
the only home you ever knew?

314
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:12,682
I don't know. I never really knew one.

315
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:14,701
Well, this is Rose's home.

316
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,802
Been in the family over a century.

317
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:18,970
Used to be the family estate,

318
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:22,563
And now she gets to live in
some senior-Living graveyard,

319
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,662
And they tear this place down.

320
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:27,350
That's too bad.

321
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:31,263
I hear Rose isn't feeling well either.

322
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:32,440
No, she isn't.

323
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:34,083
What's wrong with her?

324
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,432
It's not my business to say.

325
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,200
Who's this?

326
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,711
That's Rose

327
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:48,313
When she was a little girl.

328
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,520
Who's that with her?

329
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,341
That's her nanny, Marie.

330
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:01,992
She looked after Rose
more than her own mother.

331
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:26,412
How you feeling, Sammy?

332
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:31,770
I guess mixing whiskey and jager
wasn't such a gangbuster idea, was it?

333
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:37,010
I'll bet you don't remember a
thing from last night, do you?

334
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:39,293
No, I can still taste the tequila.

335
00:20:40,996 --> 00:20:43,451
You know, there's a really
good hangover remedy. It's uh...

336
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:47,142
It's a greasy pork sandwich
served up in a dirty ashtray.

337
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,040
Oh, I hate you. I know you do.

338
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,823
Hey, turns out when
grandma Rose was a tyke,

339
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:56,773
She had a creole nanny
who wore a hoodoo necklace.

340
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,971
So you think she taught
Rose hoodoo? Yes, I do.

341
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:04,270
All right.

342
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:08,610
I think it's time we talk to Rose, then.

343
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:10,661
Oh, you need to brush your teeth first.

344
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:21,983
Hello?

345
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:24,752
Susan?

346
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:27,533
Clear?

347
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,053
Mrs. Thompson?

348
00:22:57,685 --> 00:22:59,373
Mrs. Thompson?

349
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:03,631
Rose?

350
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,152
Hi, Mrs. Thompson. We're not
here to hurt you. It's okay. We...

351
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,412
Rose?

352
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:21,692
Dean.

353
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,220
This woman's had a stroke.

354
00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:30,493
Yeah, but hoodoo's hands-On. Yeah.

355
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:33,111
You got to mix herbs and
chant, build an altar.

356
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:35,023
So it can't be Rose.

357
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:37,921
Hey, maybe it's not even hoodoo.
You know, she could be faking.

358
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:39,762
What do you want to do,
poke her with a stick?

359
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:42,911
Dude, you're not gonna
poke her with a stick.

360
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:44,351
What the hell?

361
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:45,921
What are you doing in here?

362
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:47,861
We just wanted to talk to Rose.

363
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:49,732
Look at her. She's
scared out of her wits.

364
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,910
I want you out of my
hotel in two minutes

365
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:53,160
Or I'm calling the cops.

366
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:12,300
Your turn. Eightsies.

367
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:20,622
Have you started packing yet?

368
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:22,242
No. Why not?

369
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:23,671
I don't want to move.

370
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:26,192
Yes, I know, but we have to.

371
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,291
But Maggie says we're
not allowed to move.

372
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,182
Yeah?

373
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:33,621
Tyler, enough. Maggie is imaginary.

374
00:24:33,668 --> 00:24:36,780
You're too old to have an imaginary
friend, and I am done pretending.

375
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:42,533
I don't like her.

376
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,743
I  could lug those boxes for you.

377
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:07,631
I got it, Sherwin. Thanks.

378
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:09,021
Okay, then.

379
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:10,792
See you later.

380
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:18,260
You okay? I think so.

381
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:21,093
Come on. Come on. Let's
get inside. Let's go.

382
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,151
Whiskey. Sure.

383
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,671
I know the feeling.

384
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,223
What the hell happened out there?

385
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,693
You want the truth? Of course.

386
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,960
At first, we thought it was
some sort of a hoodoo curse,

387
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:38,650
But that out there...

388
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,900
That was definitely a spirit.

389
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:42,623
Here.

390
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,942
You're insane.

391
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:46,952
It's been said.

392
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:48,141
Look, I'm sorry, Susan.

393
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:50,283
We don't exactly have
time to ease you into this,

394
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:52,541
But we need to know when
your mother had the stroke.

395
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:55,601
What does that have to do...
Just answer the question.

396
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:57,703
About a month ago.

397
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,651
Right before the killings began.

398
00:27:59,656 --> 00:28:00,931
You see?

399
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:04,483
So what if Rose was working hoodoo,
but not to hurt anyone, to protect them?

400
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,843
She was using the urn patterns
to ward off the spirit.

401
00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:08,702
Right. Until she had a
stroke and couldn't anymore.

402
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:10,121
I don't believe this. Listen,

403
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:12,751
That car didn't try to run
you down by itself, okay?

404
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:17,012
I mean, I guess it did technically,
but with a spirit. Forget it.

405
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:18,162
Just believe what you want, alright?

406
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:20,292
But the fact is you and
your family are in danger.

407
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:22,371
So you need to clear
everybody out of here.

408
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:23,780
Your employees,

409
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:24,860
Your mother,

410
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:26,592
Your daughters, everyone.

411
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:32,191
I only have one daughter. One?

412
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:33,923
I thought Tyler had
a sister named Maggie.

413
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:36,670
Maggie's imaginary.

414
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:40,361
Where's Tyler?

415
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:48,712
She's going to stay here with me,

416
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,382
And you can't stop me.

417
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:55,063
There's nothing you can do about it.

418
00:28:57,448 --> 00:29:00,281
Maggie, don't. You're not
supposed to bother grandma.

419
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:01,841
I know.

420
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:05,202
Come on.

421
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,750
Let's play.

422
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,223
Can we have a tea party?

423
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,333
Tyler!

424
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:33,260
Oh, my god! Tyler!

425
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:39,153
She's not here!

426
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:42,503
Susan,

427
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:45,000
Tell us what you know
about Maggie. Not much.

428
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,102
Tyler's been talking about
her since mom got sick.

429
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:48,753
Okay, did you ever know
anyone by that name?

430
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:50,072
Uh no. Think, think.

431
00:29:50,097 --> 00:29:52,281
Somebody that could have lived
here, might have passed away.

432
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:55,383
My god... My mom had
a sister named Margaret.

433
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,450
She barely spoke about her.

434
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,340
Did Margaret die here
when she was a kid?

435
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:00,213
Yeah, she drowned in the pool.

436
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,052
Come on.

437
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:23,143
I don't like it up here.

438
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:24,881
I'm scared.

439
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:26,580
It's okay.

440
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:28,522
All you have to do is jump.

441
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:33,193
I can't swim.

442
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:34,381
I know.

443
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,351
But it won't hurt.

444
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,550
I promise.

445
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,802
And then we can be together forever,

446
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:43,161
And no one will bother us.

447
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:50,103
Why don't you just
come with me and mommy?

448
00:30:50,178 --> 00:30:53,861
Because I can't leave here,
and you can't leave me.

449
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:58,913
Please.

450
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:00,620
I don't want to be alone.

451
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:15,702
Tyler!

452
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:21,961
Mommy!

453
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:29,461
Is there another entrance?

454
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,160
Around back. All right, let's go!

455
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:32,133
Keep working.

456
00:31:56,985 --> 00:31:59,070
It'll all be over soon.

457
00:32:00,978 --> 00:32:01,932
Stand back.

458
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:06,553
Son of a bitch.

459
00:32:13,427 --> 00:32:14,950
Margaret...

460
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:19,532
Margaret...

461
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:24,751
Oh, thank god. Thank god!

462
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:26,300
Mommy?

463
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:27,833
Yeah, baby, I'm here.

464
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:31,012
Tyler, do you see Maggie anywhere?

465
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:34,030
No, she's gone.

466
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:48,802
You'd really do that for me?

467
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,892
Yes...

468
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:58,411
If you did,

469
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,450
I'd let them go.

470
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:04,552
But I don't understand.

471
00:34:04,595 --> 00:34:07,463
You kept me away for so long.

472
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,810
I thought you didn't love me anymore.

473
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:16,610
Okay...

474
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:18,690
Little sister.

475
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:35,380
Don't worry, honey. We're
leaving in two minutes.

476
00:34:35,477 --> 00:34:36,610
We just got to get grandma.

477
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:41,563
I don't get it. Did Maggie just stop?

478
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,402
Seems like it. Where
the hell did she go?

479
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:16,441
Paramedics said it was another stroke.

480
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:18,501
Do you think...

481
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,303
Margaret could have had
something to do with it?

482
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,042
We don't know.

483
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:24,460
But it's possible,

484
00:35:24,468 --> 00:35:25,660
Yeah.

485
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,001
Susan, I'm sorry.

486
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:32,752
You have nothing to apologize for.

487
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:35,070
You've given me everything.

488
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,103
Ready to go, kiddo?

489
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,372
Yeah.

490
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:43,230
Tyler, you're sure
Maggie's not around anymore?

491
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:45,190
I'm sure. I'd see her.

492
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:52,982
I guess whatever's
going on must be over.

493
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,282
You two take care of
yourselves, all right?

494
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:06,061
Thank you.

495
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,603
Yeah.

496
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:08,982
Both of you.

497
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:21,021
Think you could have hooked
up some milf action there, bud.

498
00:36:21,026 --> 00:36:22,981
Serious, I think she liked you. Yeah,

499
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:24,531
That's all she needs.

500
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:26,783
Well, you saved the
mommy, you saved the girl.

501
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,080
Not a bad day.

502
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,933
'Course,you know, I could
have saved them myself,

503
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:31,681
But I didn't want you to feel useless.

504
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,701
All right, I appreciate it.

505
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,661
Feels good getting back
in the saddle, doesn't it?

506
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:38,910
Yeah.

507
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,120
Yeah, it does.

508
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:43,840
But it doesn't change what we
talked about last night, Dean.

509
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:47,403
We talked about a lot
of things last night.

510
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:50,071
You know what I mean. You were wasted.

511
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:51,060
But you weren't...

512
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:53,700
And you promised.
