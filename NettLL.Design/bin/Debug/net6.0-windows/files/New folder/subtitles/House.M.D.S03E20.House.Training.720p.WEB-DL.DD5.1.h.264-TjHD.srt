1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,561
Ladies and gentlemen,
step around. Step around.
Come on. Gather around.

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,729
We'll show you
a little way to make
a little easy money today.

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,295
You understand
what I'm saying?
These are the blacks.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,308
Don't follow the blacks.
You wanna follow the queen.
Know why?

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,241
'Cause she's red
and that means she is hot.

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,437
You gotta find the queen.
Find the queen.

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,707
The first of the day
is free to play.
Who wants to play?

8
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,215
You look interested, my man.
You wanna step on up?
Come on now.

9
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,978
Who wants to play?
Oh, what about you, sweetie?

10
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,041
You're cute.
Come on up.
All right.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,554
Come on here and play.
Cute girls win money.
You look lucky.

12
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:23,748
Now, you look lucky.
Now, follow the queen.

13
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:24,949
Here we go,
ladies and gentlemen.
Follow the queen.

14
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,049
Follow the queen.

15
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,492
Ain't no Helen Mirren,
but this queen is for you!

16
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,052
Which one? Which one?
Which one is it?
Which one is it?

17
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,258
It's right there.
Right there?

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,592
(WHOOPS)

19
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,032
Beginner's luck.
Beginner's luck.
I'll tell you what.

20
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,263
It takes a woman
to know a woman.

21
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,737
It takes a lady
to find a queen.

22
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,298
There you go...
Wanna double up?

23
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,777
All right.
All right,
we've got a chancer.

24
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,244
We got a chancer.
We got a chancer.

25
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,439
All right. Here we go.
Here we go.

26
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,777
All you gotta do
is find your queen.

27
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,818
You will not win again.
You will not win again.
All right.

28
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,911
Here we go. Here we go.
Find your queen.
Find your queen.

29
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,819
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?

30
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,289
Can you find her?

31
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,885
Right there.
This one? Oh, my...

32
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,452
She is killing me here.
Taking all my money.

33
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,465
Anybody else wanna get behind
the good-luck girl?

34
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,591
I can do it.

35
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,998
You can do it?
All right. You're next.

36
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,559
Just give me a chance
to recover and
get my money back

37
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,366
or else I'm gonna be out here
sleeping on the street.

38
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,599
Here we go.
All right? Ready?

39
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,163
This is the last time.
I'm not messing
with you no more.

40
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,265
You're taking
all my money, girl.

41
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,400
I'm not messing
with you no more.

42
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,069
Here we go. One more chance.
This is your last chance.

43
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,134
You're gonna follow
the queen, baby.

44
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,373
Follow the queen.
Where's she at?
Where's she at?

45
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,416
Just one time.
I'll show you one time
and there she is.

46
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,883
Boom. Boom. Boom.
Pick a card.

47
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,588
I can't decide.

48
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,591
What do you mean?
Just pick a card.
Just make a decision.

49
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,683
I can't decide.

50
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,955
Come on. Any card will do.
Left? Right? Center?

51
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,087
I don't know.

52
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,528
Do you want the right?
I don't know.

53
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,395
I...
The left?

54
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,991
The center?
I don't know. I...

55
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,399
Move out the way and just
let somebody else play then?

56
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,496
I can't decide. I can't.

57
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,597
You wanna flip
a coin for it?

58
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,437
What's wrong with me?

59
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,410
MAN: Is she okay?

60
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,080
Scariest 30 seconds
of my life.

61
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,483
I couldn't do anything.

62
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,215
It's like I couldn't
move inside my head.

63
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,483
It's called abulia.

64
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,685
The inability to
make a decision
or exercise will.

65
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,125
Is it going to happen again?

66
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,755
It's part of a TIA.
A transient ischemic attack.

67
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,090
Blood was cut off to a section
of your frontal lobe.

68
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,691
Is it like a stroke
or something?

69
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:49,757
A little.

70
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,634
What drugs have you
taken recently?

71
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,804
No drugs.

72
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,637
Toxins are
another possibility.

73
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,041
You might have been exposed
to something at work,
for instance.

74
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,012
No real job right now.

75
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,981
Exposure can build up
over time

76
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,482
and lie dormant for a while.

77
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,048
What was your last job?
Pet store.

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,417
Exotic pets?

79
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,785
Tropical fish.

80
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,880
And before that?

81
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:11,981
Unemployment.

82
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,086
And before that,

83
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,696
I sold subscriptions
on the phone.

84
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,824
And before that,
unemployment.

85
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,195
Before that,
I worked at Jeans Gone Wild.

86
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:30,137
Before that, unemployment.
Before that, I walked dogs.

87
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,272
And before that...

88
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,516
Loss of free will. I like it.

89
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,149
Maybe we can get
Thomas Aquinas
in for a consult.

90
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,254
What caused the TIA?

91
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,217
Arteries are clear.
No sign of a clot.

92
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,322
Could have dissolved.
Most likely came
from her heart.

93
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,485
We should do a bubble study.

94
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,121
Clots are unlikely
in a 28-year-old
who's not on the pill.

95
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,131
It's probably a vasospasm
caused by drugs.

96
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,724
I don't think so.
She goes from job to job.

97
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,100
Maybe there's some kind
of ADD here.

98
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,468
Help us pinpoint
where the neurological...

99
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,201
She goes from job to job
because she's a scam artist.

100
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,573
She works just long enough
to qualify for unemployment,

101
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,475
then gets fired
and gets high.

102
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,480
I still don't think
it's drugs.

103
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,845
Did you check
for infection?

104
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,383
LP showed nothing.
No fever.

105
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,475
White blood count is normal.

106
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,712
Could be toxic exposure.

107
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,720
You're the one always saying
it must be drugs.

108
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,154
You figure she's a minority,
she must be stoned?

109
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,192
You know that's what I...
She seems like a nice girl.

110
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,420
FOREMAN:
You haven't met her!

111
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,428
She was pregnant at 15,
dropped out of high school.

112
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,793
She's a real overachiever.

113
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,923
CHASE: Come on.
Cut her some slack.
Her baby died of SIDS.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,365
This isn't some
romantic story

115
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,129
about a nice girl
scarred by tragedy.

116
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,535
She's a drug-using scam artist
scarred by tragedy.

117
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,233
On the other hand,
the tox screen just came back.

118
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,502
She's clean.

119
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,635
You're wasting my time.
He's wasting...

120
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,041
Second ex-Mrs. Wilson
want money?

121
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,477
I am no longer
paying alimony.

122
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,953
She wanted
her independence,

123
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,490
so she got her
realtor's license.

124
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,354
Market's doing badly.
She wants money.

125
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,723
Market's doing badly.

126
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,352
She's moving into a condo.

127
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,624
She wants...
She wants me
to take Hector.

128
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,325
Pool boy?

129
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,858
Dog.

130
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,158
No longer interested.

131
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,330
We got him
on our honeymoon.

132
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,465
So I'm like
the other parent.

133
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,008
But I can't take him.

134
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,136
My hotel doesn't allow dogs.
Besides, I'm always here.

135
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,112
I asked Cuddy
to a play Thursday.

136
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,681
(CHUCKLES)

137
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,747
Oh, you... Okay.

138
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,344
She said she was busy.

139
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:26,085
And you didn't believe her,
so you bribed a janitor,

140
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,491
broke into her computer,
checked her appointments...

141
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,392
I asked her as a test.

142
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,488
What would you have learned
if she'd said yes?

143
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,032
A lot about bondage.

144
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,057
She was busy for me
but not for you.

145
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,228
She's not interested
in play <i>qua</i> play.

146
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,033
She's interested in you.

147
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,701
No. I'm not getting
sucked into the vortex
of your insanity again.

148
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,038
Don't pass me
notes in class.

149
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,442
Don't tell me to
ask her to the prom.

150
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,070
You cannot
see her socially.

151
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,171
You're leading her on.

152
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,115
I'll consider that.
After I take her
to the Hockney exhibit.

153
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,109
On Thursday.

154
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,021
See, she is busy.
It's not a date.

155
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,992
She enjoyed the play.
I enjoyed her
enjoying the play.

156
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,825
The woman works hard.
It's nice to see her relax.

157
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:09,256
So all this enjoying
is an act of charity.

158
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,633
I'm keeping the receipts
for tax purposes.

159
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,873
What's life
without the ability
to make stupid choices?

160
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,471
She needs her free will.

161
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,642
Find out why her brain froze
before she can't decide
to take her next breath.

162
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,618
You find the toxins.
You run your bubble study.

163
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,087
You won't find anything but
I'll get the office to myself.

164
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,888
There's a lot of porn
piling up on the Internet.

165
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,358
Doesn't download itself.

166
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,428
Eric? Eric!

167
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,192
Hello, Mr. Foreman.

168
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,601
Dr. Chase. How are you?
Good.

169
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,103
You're lucky
you caught us, actually...

170
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,264
I'll meet you outside.

171
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:53,802
Hey, Dad. I've got to go.
Why are you here?

172
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,780
Everything okay?

173
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,815
Good as ever.

174
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,382
We're staying at a hotel
down the street.

175
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,347
You didn't bring Mom with you?

176
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,855
It's gonna be her
60th birthday in a few days.

177
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,987
I know. We talked
about it on the phone.

178
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,787
You said you couldn't
come home.

179
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,685
You didn't have to come.

180
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,163
You haven't been home
in eight years.

181
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,531
She should see you,

182
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,100
while she still
knows who you are.

183
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,102
Dad. I've talked to her
on the phone.

184
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,311
She only knows
who I am sometimes.

185
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,540
Sometimes

186
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,580
is important.

187
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,948
So what's up with your dad?
Didn't know he was
gonna be in town?

188
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,050
No.

189
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,264
Building this old, could be
toxic exposure anywhere.

190
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,733
Asbestos, mold,
the coloring agents
in the old wallpaper.

191
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,236
Or it could be drugs.

192
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,795
I thought we ruled out...

193
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,066
Clean tox screen means
drugs didn't cause the TIA.

194
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,044
Drugs can be laced
with toxic substances.

195
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,670
Arsenic, rat poison.

196
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,112
The drugs wash out
of her system,

197
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,376
the toxins stick around.

198
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,315
Exposure could come about
any number of ways.

199
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,580
There's no reason to assume
it was through drug use.

200
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,849
Absolutely.
Except for the crack pipe.

201
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,483
I'll test her blood
for arsenic and rat poison.

202
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,993
Yeah. Yeah.
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

203
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,097
And your dad asked you out
for dinner?

204
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,595
I'll do the tests.
You're stuck with your family.

205
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,403
You like Hockney?

206
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,703
You heard about that.

207
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,142
The pop stuff or
the Venezuelan pictures?

208
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,772
That's a trick question.

209
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,746
Yes. But you have no idea
how it's a trick.

210
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,017
I like art.
I'm open to new things.
What's the problem?

211
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,355
You're going to a gallery
to see Venezuelan pictures
that don't exist.

212
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,223
But you won't go
to a play with me. Why?

213
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,492
House, why is my social life
suddenly red hot?

214
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,193
One minute I'm mushing along
with the huskies as usual

215
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,395
and suddenly
it's global warming.

216
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,836
You think you saw
somebody else pick up
a toy from the sandbox

217
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,771
and suddenly you want it.

218
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,668
Is that why you said no?

219
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,645
Maybe I just want a friend
and I thought Wilson
was a safe choice.

220
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,277
I'm not safe? Cool.

221
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,750
James Wilson is never
the safe choice.

222
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,289
We're going to a gallery.
We're not getting married.

223
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,052
Sure, you say that now.

224
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,718
He always marries them
in the end.

225
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,933
Is that Eric? Eric!

226
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,271
Oh!

227
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,109
Oh, baby. Baby!

228
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,507
I wanted to find that
picture I took at your
high school graduation.

229
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,780
I had it reframed.

230
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,583
It's in one of these
suitcases, but I don't know...

231
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,123
You can show it to me later.

232
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,360
Your father wants to know
if you've been praying.

233
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,335
You don't have to just
come out with it like that.

234
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,769
But I only want to know
if you're happy.

235
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,204
Sure. I'm okay.

236
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,764
You like it here?
You have friends?

237
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,003
Yeah.
Everything is great, Mom.

238
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,046
That's why I brought
the picture for you.

239
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,705
I remember
when you were little

240
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,875
you liked to look in
the back of the math book
because you knew

241
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,044
even though it made
no sense then,

242
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,884
by the end of the year
you'd understand it all.

243
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,615
That's why
you brought the picture?

244
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,458
You wanted to look ahead,
to see how far you'd go.

245
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,862
Now you're a grown man,
I thought you might
like to look back

246
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,958
to see how far you've come.

247
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,029
It all makes sense now.
Doesn't it?

248
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,094
(CHUCKLES)

249
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,738
That isn't mine.

250
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,336
(COUGHING)
It was in your closet.

251
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,381
It belongs to this guy
who used to live with me.

252
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,886
You might want to let him know
he's got arsenic poisoning.

253
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,254
We should get
a sample of his hair

254
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,654
so we can see
the extent of it.

255
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,420
But I don't do...
I don't do drugs.

256
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,961
(COUGHING)

257
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,668
Get a crash cart in here!
Respiratory arrest!

258
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,837
Are you sure
it isn't from the arsenic?

259
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,281
Dr. Foreman said
I was poisoned.

260
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,376
<i>Your hair showed</i>
<i>only a trace amount.</i>

261
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,045
<i>Not enough to damage</i>
<i>your lungs like this.</i>

262
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,713
<i>We need you</i>
<i>to stay still now.</i>

263
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,222
Six-millimeter cuts
starting at the apices.

264
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,525
Also, I just wanted
to let you know

265
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,997
should you change your mind,
I'll be available.

266
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,232
Aren't you getting tired
of hearing me say it?

267
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,238
I have no intention
of going out with you,

268
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,797
of having sex with you,
of doing anything with you.

269
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,864
Except work.

270
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,568
We don't have to make
a big deal about it.

271
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,237
I just thought
I'd let you know.

272
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,474
I decided Tuesdays would be
a good day to do that.

273
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,577
You did not suddenly
fall in love with me.

274
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,321
You were looking for something
and I happened to be
standing...

275
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,084
Cameron, it's fine.

276
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,192
No need to go on about it.

277
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,823
Advancing through
the lung bases.

278
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,690
We need to put this
behind us.

279
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,791
Understood.

280
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,161
But you keep bringing it up.

281
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,863
You're the one
who's still talking.

282
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,804
Look, I'm not demanding
anything from you.

283
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,275
I'm not following you home.
I've got no expectations.

284
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,677
A gentle, polite reminder
once a week
is hardly stalking.

285
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,983
There's a mass.
Just outside the lingula.

286
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,226
Biopsy shows
there are white blood cells

287
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,693
in the walls
of the blood vessels.

288
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,095
They're not supposed
to get past the bouncers.

289
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,996
Got to be autoimmune,
something lymphocytic.

290
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,898
White blood cells
are attacking her own body.

291
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,937
Only question is,
what kind of autoimmune?

292
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,096
Doesn't matter what kind.

293
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,867
It always matters what kind.

294
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,100
Treatment's always steroids.

295
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,642
Treatment is always boring.

296
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,870
Diagnosis...
Okay.

297
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,536
It's affecting
the larger blood vessels.

298
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,377
Gotta be giant cell arteritis.
I'll start her on steroids.

299
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,178
It's affecting
the smaller blood vessels.

300
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,445
Gotta be lupus vasculitis.

301
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,043
I'll start her on steroids.

302
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,315
It's affecting...
Yeah. Got it.

303
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,879
Start her on steroids.

304
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,981
Good idea.

305
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,856
Told you. That was boring.

306
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,254
I gotta go out.
Why?

307
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,165
Wilson's got a date.

308
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,259
<i>BONNIE.: It's got</i>
<i>15-foot ceilings.</i>

309
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,167
It's got an open floor plan.

310
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,227
(CHUCKLES)

311
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,307
You know, I can't believe
you called me.

312
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,337
Hey. I need a condo.

313
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,614
Didn't you and Wilson have
your first date around here?

314
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,443
Wow! You remember
where our first date was?

315
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,581
I didn't think
you were paying attention.

316
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,952
Really? He's my best friend.

317
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,319
Our first date was in Boston.

318
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,450
Oh.

319
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,024
Not quite as close
to here as I remember.

320
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,585
But we're not here
to talk about him.

321
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,995
Absolutely not.

322
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,466
Wait till you see the kitchen.

323
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,633
All-granite countertops.

324
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,739
Since I wasn't paying
attention back then,

325
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,899
what was it like dating him?

326
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,107
So this is Hockney?
No.

327
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,340
I don't know what happened.

328
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,439
I'm sure you don't.

329
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,585
I never knew your tastes
were so eclectic.

330
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,653
Oh, the Hockney exhibit
finished on April 20th.

331
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,215
I thought it was May 20th.

332
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,158
Okay. My bad.

333
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,796
This is not somewhere
I'd bring someone on a date.

334
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,862
Not that this is a date.
Obviously.

335
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,569
I was just thinking...

336
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,137
He's doing landscapes
on multiple canvases now.

337
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,078
And they're kind of peaceful
and you're always so busy...

338
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,375
Wow.

339
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,677
(CHUCKLES)

340
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,377
I don't think I've ever
seen you embarrassed before.

341
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,814
Oh, it was never a date.

342
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,084
I was coming off
a bad relationship

343
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,216
and he said we could
go out as friends.

344
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,353
You know, just go see plays,
go to a museum.

345
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,496
I didn't think
you liked Trenton.

346
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,623
Love it.

347
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,228
So he'd say it's not a date
but then he'd jump you.

348
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,770
Oh, no. He meant it.

349
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,306
James Wilson,
carefully calibrating

350
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,970
his level of protectiveness
for your individual needs.

351
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,945
Did you just compare
Wilson to a tampon?

352
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,174
(CHUCKLES) No.

353
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,385
It was very endearing.
He really just wanted
to be a friend.

354
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,387
So I jumped him.

355
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,814
The bedroom's through here.

356
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,321
CUDDY: That's such a bad idea.

357
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,421
There's no way that
won't cause damage
to the large intestine.

358
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,958
Are you keeping us here
to torture me?

359
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,632
Is that a bicycle pump?

360
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,730
That's what I'm saying.

361
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,173
It's like walking
into a sticky trap.

362
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,775
And once you're the focus
of all that attention,
it's addictive.

363
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,679
This unit's kitchen's
got a chef's oven.

364
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,341
I cook a lot. Go on.

365
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,581
But it's the emotional stuff
that really sucks you in.

366
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,655
He's just so
knight-in-shining-armor,
you know?

367
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,656
Always there to support you,
until one day he's not.

368
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,458
But by then you're hooked.

369
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,992
Hey, do you think that
you could talk to him
about taking the dog?

370
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,335
He's the only one
that Hector really
gets along with.

371
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,500
Hey, we're here to talk
real estate, not Wilson.

372
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,505
So you're saying
if you'd actually had sex

373
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,573
before you connected
emotionally, you'd have
gotten over him.

374
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,279
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah.
Seems weird, right?

375
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,690
'Cause sex with James
is fantastic.

376
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,622
Nobody works harder
to give a woman
what she wants.

377
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,496
It's got six burners.

378
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,328
The chef's oven.

379
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,425
Right.

380
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,064
(LUPE COUGHING)

381
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,438
How you feeling?

382
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,104
That wasn't my crack pipe.

383
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,807
You told me. Are you tired?

384
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,580
I just took a hit off it
a couple of times.

385
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,586
What's wrong with
having a little fun?

386
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,645
Your personal life
is none of my business.

387
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,991
You don't like me though,
do you?

388
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,653
That's your imagination.

389
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,287
I've seen every kind
of drug abuse.

390
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,924
No offense,
but you don't even
stand out of the pack.

391
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,565
I'm betting you got money
in the same place
you got attitude.

392
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,296
You know,
people who quit drinking
and people who lose weight.

393
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,073
They think they're better
than the people that couldn't

394
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,135
and because you got
out of the projects,

395
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,840
you think that
anybody who didn't

396
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,645
is weak and stupid.

397
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,380
I'm not judging you.
Now take a breath.

398
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,388
The only difference
between me and you

399
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,515
is that I made
some bad decisions

400
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,819
and you made some good ones.

401
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,922
You make bad decisions
every day of your life.

402
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,793
Stop doing drugs.
Stop having fun.

403
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,491
Go back to school
and get your GED.

404
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,431
Yeah, where's the money
coming from?

405
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,965
The system's not set up
for people like me.

406
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,073
What are you staring at?

407
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,164
Your eyes.

408
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,610
There's yellow in the sclera.

409
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,213
Her liver's failing.

410
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,047
Without a transplant,
she'll be dead
in the next 48 hours.

411
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,916
We should increase
her immunosuppressants
and target more specifically.

412
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,045
Add methotrexate.

413
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,589
Yeah, let's do more
of what's not working.

414
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,420
This isn't an
autoimmune disease.

415
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,357
Her white blood cells
are attacking her body.

416
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,416
That's autoimmune.

417
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,326
FOREMAN: First brain,
then lungs, now liver.

418
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,365
All getting worse
and all in two days.

419
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,865
It's moving too fast.

420
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,662
It's gotta be cancer.
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

421
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,904
It's rare even
by our standards
but it fits her symptoms.

422
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,568
Explains why the steroids
aren't working,
poor fingernail growth.

423
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,110
A lot of people
have bad fingernails.

424
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,578
A lot of people don't have
three organ systems
shutting down.

425
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,877
Her blood vessels are
taking this thing everywhere.

426
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,212
She needs total
body radiation.

427
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,047
We can't do anything
until we can confirm...

428
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,054
Running those
immunochemistries
could take a week.

429
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,111
She'll be dead by the time...

430
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,986
That doesn't make
radiation any safer.

431
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,116
Okay.

432
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,388
Suppose Chase
and Cameron are right.

433
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,691
Suppose it's an
autoimmune disease.

434
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,254
What's the biggest danger
of total body radiation?

435
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,830
It suppresses
the immune system,

436
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,836
which is what
we're trying to do
with the steroids anyway.

437
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,500
I don't usually
put out on my first date

438
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,098
but I gotta say
that is a rad move.

439
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,108
Get her consent.
Start the radiation.

440
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,649
The patient's
not too thrilled with me.

441
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,241
I'll get her consent.

442
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,013

personality issues,

443
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,056
so you're gonna step in?

444
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,921
Patient doesn't like Foreman.
I'm interested.

445
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:29,927
Fatigue, hair loss,
possibility of damage
to the lungs, infertility.

446
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,835
All possible side effects
of radiation.

447
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,304

Dr. Foreman?

I don't know.

452

Can we get back
to what's wrong with me?

453
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,687
There's a small
possibility of leukemia
at some time in the future.

454
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,785
Hardly worth mentioning.

455
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,950
You can't say he thinks
he's better than he is

456
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,994
if you don't know
how good he is.

457

as he thinks he is.

Huh?

496

Yeah. She also said

497
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,793
that if she'd slept with you
before she liked you

(SHUSHING)

514
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,628
I'm getting a murmur.

515
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,038
Oh, my arm! It's hurting me!

516
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,939
Take it off! Take it off!

517
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,273
(SCREAMING)

518
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,672
Oh, my God!

519
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,545
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

520
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,281
CAMERON: Pain is the issue.

521
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,589
Just the pressure
of the BP cuff

522
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,287
was enough
to start her screaming.

523
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,659
That's not cancer.

524
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,596
It sounds like...

525
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,732
Sounds like she's septic.

526
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,939
A lot of things
can cause pain.

527
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,933
How much pain?

528
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,805
Too much.

529
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,441
It's not cancer.
It's not autoimmune.

530
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,121
It's an infection and
we fried her immune system.

531
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,657
CHASE: But she had no fever.
Her LP was clear.

532
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,586
Do an echo.
Confirm it's in the heart.

533
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:57,225
And then I'll tell our patient
that we just killed her.

534
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,435
I'll tell her.

535
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,305
(DOOR OPENS)

536
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,909
Hi. You haven't been
returning my phone calls.

537
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,308
I'm busy.

538
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,753
Well, but if you
have half an hour

539
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,051
a little later this afternoon,

540
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,820
I just found this unit
ten minutes from here.

541
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,383
It hasn't been
on the market yet.

542
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,293
I'm off the market for condos.

543
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,096
James was right?

544
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,733
I never had
the teeniest chance
of selling you anything?

545
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,134
Of course he was right.

546
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,798
Wilson doesn't stop
giving good advice
just 'cause you're divorced.

547
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,068
He's compulsive about
remaining on good terms
with his exes.

548
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,445
Do you wanna know why
I named that dog Hector?

549
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,681
No. Let's keep it a mystery.

550
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,882
Because even when
he was a puppy,

551
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,324
he was the worst-tempered dog
we'd ever seen.

552
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,054
He was supposed
to be house-trained.

553
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,494
He'd pee on the carpet
every morning.

554
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,590
When we had people over,
he had to nip at their ankles.

555
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,899
"Hector does go rug"
is an anagram
for "Doctor Greg House".

556
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,099
That's how early
in the marriage
I resented you.

557
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,870
Wow. Did I ever waste money
on that place setting.

558
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,604
James at least
had the decency

559
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,043
to feel guilty
when he hurt me.

560
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,774
Whereas I didn't hurt you.

561
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,017
I didn't even marry you,
cleverly hoping to avoid
moments like this one.

562
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,213
You always needed him and
he was always there for you.

563
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,017
If you keep yelling,
I'll think you'll owe me sex.

564
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,752
You knew he had a wife
waiting at home.
You didn't care.

565
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,286
Now, I'm not saying
you broke up the marriage,
but you didn't help.

566
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,636
First, "Hector does go rug"
is a lame anagram.

567
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,196
You want a better one
for Gregory House?
"Huge ego. Sorry."

568
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,867
Second, find a new career.

569
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,301
You're never gonna
sell anybody

570
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,743
if you let them
control the agenda.

571
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,302
And third,
I don't owe you anything.

572
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,782
I'm not Wilson.
I'm not gonna buy a condo
just to make you feel better.

573
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,225
WILSON: You okay?

574
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,319
Yeah.

575
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,788
Tell me how to do this.

576
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,963
House says
people thank you after.

577
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,194
It's not typical.

578
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,500
I already killed this woman.

579
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,067
All I can do now
is not make
any more mistakes.

580
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,307
First of all, stop thinking
you can minimize the hurt.

581
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,976
A lot of people are afraid
of the word "dying."

582
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,682
If you pussyfoot around it,
she's not going to
read your mind.

583
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,781
Okay.
No, it's not.

584
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,916
When you look in her face,

585
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,121
you're gonna feel
the instinct to temporize.

586
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,424
Crush it.

587
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:40,623
Yeah.

588
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,361
Then wait.

589
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,665
Give her time
to process the news.

590
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,202
Let her know
you'll be with her
through all of it.

591
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,539
Wait till she's
done thinking,

592
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,043
till she meets
your eyes again.

593
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,376
Then if you feel
it's appropriate,
you can touch her.

594
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,076
Maybe put your hand
on her arm like this.

595
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,778
Let her know
she's still connected
to another human being.

596
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,419
You've got this down
to a science.

597
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,353
You're freaking out.

598
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,257
I told you...
Give her what she needs.

599
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,226
What she doesn't need
is a doctor who's
not there with her

600
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,459
because he made
the wrong call.

601
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,696
You are freaking out.
You should be freaking out.

602
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,998
I won't let her see it.

603
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,374
Let her see it.

604
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,740
Hey.

605
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,687
How come no mask?

606
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,022
We think...

607
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,190
You have an infection.

608
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,594
Didn't the radiation work?

609
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,133
It did what it was
supposed to do.

610
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,332
You're dying.

611
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,042
What do you mean?
Like things are bad and
that someday I'm gonna...

612
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,137
How much time?

613
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,916
How much time?

614
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,178
We can't know exactly.

615
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,480
A year?

616
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,915
Less than a year?

617
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,651
Less than 24 hours.

618
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,317
I don't understand.

619
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,056
Why are you saying this to me?
You're trying to scare me?

620
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,495
Why would you do that?

621
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:21,657
I'm sorry.

622
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,859
It's true.

623
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,737
How bad is this cancer?
Yesterday you thought
I had a chance.

624
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,104
You don't have cancer.

625
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,836
You came in with an infection.

626
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:34,969
We didn't catch it.

627
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,673
What kind of infection?

628
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,113
Doesn't matter.

(SIGHS)

630
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,878
Radiation was the worst thing
we could have done.

631
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,052
We destroyed
the part of your body
that was fighting it off.

632
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,088
It's spread to your heart.

633
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,888
Then give me drugs.

634
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,394
They have drugs
for infections.

635
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,023
Antibiotics work
with the immune system,

636
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,091
but your immune system
is nonexistent
because of the radiation.

637
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,569
If it's my heart,
you can get me a new heart.

638

People have heart transplants
all the time!

639
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,268
It wouldn't help.

640
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,701
The infection's everywhere.

641
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,641

anybody can do.

We'll call your grandparents.

Get out!

00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,270
Get out!

CAMERON: I think it's broken.

649
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,615
Nothing like a melodramatic
gesture to solve everything.

650
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,023
We were wrong, too.
Steroids wouldn't
have helped her.

651
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,187
I didn't not help her.
I actually pulled the trigger.

652
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,493
There's nothing left
for you to do.

go home with...

You're trying to
make me feel better?

655
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,336
Yeah.
I killed a woman.

Don't you think
it's appropriate

657
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,369
I feel like crap
for at least a little while?

658
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,432
It won't help her.

659
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,871
Where is he?

660
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,347
He went to the ICU.

We still don't know
what infection...

664
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,118
It's not gonna help her.

665
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,422
It's not gonna hurt her.

666
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,826
Well, it is gonna hurt her
but it's not gonna...

No.

a few minutes.

of an abscess,

You really don't care
why she's gonna be dead.

Want to see
if I'm dying on schedule?

to tell you it's all right,

No.

00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,073
Your grandparents
haven't arrived yet.

690
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,173
If they don't make it on time,

691
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,936
is there anything
you'd like me to tell them?

692
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,446
I never really knew them.

693
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,079
You got any friends
you want me to call?

694
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,046
It's the middle of the night.

695
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,321
They're not the kind
of friends you ask
to help you move,

696
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,792
never mind watch you die.

697
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,463
I never did much.

698

No kid to leave behind.

699

not gonna be any different.

700
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,671
Kind of a relief for you, huh?

701
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,154
You were right about me.

702
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,123
Yeah? Which time?

703
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,555
I had a problem with you.

704
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,559
But you were wrong, too.

705
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,238
I've made some bad decisions.

706
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:07,337
Stole cars. Robbed houses.

707
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,606
Killed a woman.

(CLEARS THROAT)

709
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,043
But then I got another chance.

710
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,347
Left home, went to college,
entered a whole other world.

711
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,095
And there's some part of me
I can't get rid of,
always thinks,

712
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,430
if I'm not the smartest,
if I'm not the first,
everywhere I go

713
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,336
they'll figure out
I'm not supposed to be here.

714
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,765
They'll send me back.

715
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,508
You know that's
not gonna happen.

716
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,173
You're out.

717
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,646
I'll never be out of there.

718
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,651
When I came home
that last Christmas
I was in college,

719
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,518
it was like the rooms

720
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,991
felt so small.

721
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,464
It was suffocating.

722
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,631
But when I was standing
on the stoop saying goodbye,

723
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,103
my mom put her arms around me.

724
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,537
That was...

725
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,643
That was the last time
I ever felt at home.

726
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,850
I only put distance

727
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,591
between you and me
because I know
there isn't any.

728
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,929
You were right about me, too.

729
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:44,197
That stuff about
the system being
against people like me...

730
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,641
I know it's crap.

731
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,340
I mean, it's true
but it's also crap.

732
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:55,612
I just wasn't ready
to try again.

733
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,016
But I always thought
I was young.

734
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,886
I had time.

No.

Listen, I don't...

I don't know what I believe
but sometimes I need to think

748
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,092
there's something out there
paying attention.

749
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,657
So when I can't
talk to anybody,

750
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,729
I talk to God and pretend
somebody's listening.

We were all wrong. You know?
