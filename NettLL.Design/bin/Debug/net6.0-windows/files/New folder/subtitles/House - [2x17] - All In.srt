1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,515
The human heart is a giant muscle

2
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:05,874
squeezing our contracting
over 60 times each minute.

3
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:07,391
That's 3,600...

4
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:10,837
At this point,
your blood is a deep purple.

5
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:15,375
Because it's just finished
dropping off oxygen for
all the parts of your body.

6
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:19,782
Come on, follow me.

7
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:22,066
Come on.

8
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:28,064
Ian.

9
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:30,627
I have a question, and
I need to go to the bathroom.

10
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:32,429
Which would you like to do first?

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,264
- The question.
- Okay.

12
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:35,949
Where's the bathroom?

13
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,607
Who knows where
the bathroom is?

14
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:39,489
I do.

15
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:41,090
Go with Ian to the bathroom.

16
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:42,465
I don't have to go.

17
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:44,878
We're not at school.
Nobody goes anywhere
by themselves.

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,527
Why?

19
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:46,860
In case you get lost.

20
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,720
Or in case
somebody kidnaps us.

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,245
If somebody kidnaps Ian,
they'll kidnap me too.

22
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:52,498
I want to stay
with the class.

23
00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:54,916
Michael, go with Ian--
[Sharp gasp] Aah!

24
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,082
Do you need help?

25
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,611
I need you
to find a grown-up.

26
00:00:57,611 --> 00:00:58,598
Is the baby coming?

27
00:00:58,638 --> 00:00:59,551
Aah! Aah!

28
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:00,984
Who should I take with me?

29
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:03,225
You're fine.
Go to the front desk, or--

30
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:04,684
Or find a security guard.

31
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:06,531
I really have to pee.

32
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:09,740
God.

33
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,882
Is--is the baby coming?

34
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:13,596
I don't know
how to do this.

35
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,525
Are you okay, Ian?

36
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:17,203
Yeah, sure.

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,660
I don't think you are.

38
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:26,040
You're bleeding.

39
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:30,305
Help!

40
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:31,466
Help!

41
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:36,847
2X17 - All In

42
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:02,291
Original Airdate (FOX): 11 APR-2006

43
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:07,950
"Deed I do"

44
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:16,058
# Do I love you?
Oh my do I "

45
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:20,231
# Honey, indeed I do #

46
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:26,548
# Do I want you?
Oh my do I #

47
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,652
# Honey, deed I do #

48
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,465
- 20.
- Call.

49
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:32,834
You'll call anything.

50
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,015
My stack is bigger than your stack.

51
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:37,679
You in or out?

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,927
You know that relative to their size,
gorillas have smaller testicles than humans.

53
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:46,714
Well, then you'd probably
have an edge over a gorilla.
But not over me.

54
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:52,721
The reason is,
primate teste size inversely corresponds
to the fidelity of our females.

55
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,983
Do you think
there might be a better time
to annoy me about my wife?

56
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,622
- I'm talking about poker.
- Right.

57
00:02:58,702 --> 00:03:00,568
Women are evil.
You're right to drive them away.

58
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,094
Call, fold, or raise.
Story time can wait.

59
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:05,452
We're smaller and
better than chimps,

60
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:08,189
bigger and worse than gorillas.

61
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,005
For all our rationality, supposed trust
and fealty to a higher power,

62
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:16,978
our ability to create
a system of rules and laws,

63
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,380
our baser drives are
more powerful than any of that.

64
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,099
We want to control
our emotions, but we can't.

65
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,050
If we're happy,
things don't annoy us.

66
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:30,772
If, on the other hand, we're
sitting on crappy hole cards,

67
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,331
little tiny things annoy us
a whole lot more.

68
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:39,556
I raise.

69
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:41,963
So are you going to
tell me an annoying story
every time I raise?

70
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:43,909
God, that would be annoying.

71
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,329
I call.

72
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:49,132
Dr. Cuddy?
Got one of your patients in the E.R.

73
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,692
Ian Alston.
Six years old.

74
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,673
Ah... Oh, I know him.
What's the problem?
I'm all in.

75
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:57,943
Bloody diarrhea, hemodynamically stable,
but he's been developing
some coordination problems.

76
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,929
It sounds like gastroenteritis
and dehydration.

77
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,183
Order fluids, and
I'll take it on my service.

78
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:03,213
Cuddy:
Bet's to you, House.

79
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:04,238
They scan his head?

80
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,088
- No, why would they scan--
- Don't play games.

81
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:08,327
- You gonna call?
- How's the heart rate?

82
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:09,310
Stable.

83
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,593
I'm sorry. House?
It's gastroenteritis.

84
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,233
I'm not going anywhere.

85
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:18,173
Put the order in, and
have someone tell Alan and Sarah
that I'll be up when I'm done.

86
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:21,032
You in or out?

87
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:26,556
I'm  out.

88
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:31,997
Stone cold bluff.

89
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:36,090
You might want to
spend a little more time
paying attention to your cards,

90
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:38,819
and a little less time
staring at my breasts.

91
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,534
They don't match, either.

92
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,381
I'm going to take some air.

93
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:05,289
Follow my finger with your eyes.

94
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:13,191
How much longer
will Dr. Cuddy be?

95
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,995
Well, given the number of Mojitos

96
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:19,734
she's knocking back at the party,
I'd say it's gonna be at least three hours
before she's even conscious.

97
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,199
Weren't you at the same party?

98
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:23,891
I don't drink.

99
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:28,863
I want you to reach out
and grab my cane.

100
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:35,415
What's wrong?

101
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:38,791
Your son's brain is
losing control of his muscles.

102
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:42,514
Dr. Cuddy's message said it was
just dehydration from the diarrhea.

103
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:43,894
She's wrong.

104
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,194
Is he going to be all right?

105
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:52,261
I don't know.

106
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,592
So were you in one of those cages?

107
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:24,778
No.

108
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:28,525
No, no, no.
Those are for tourists.

109
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:30,574
You were in the water
with a great white.

110
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:31,314
Sure.

111
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:34,715
It's no big deal.
You just have to keep an eye on them.

112
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,822
If they get too close,
punch 'em in the nose.

113
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,877
Send them on their way.

114
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:44,139
- I had you going.
- You are mean.

115
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:47,457
Hey, how's that anal fissure?

116
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,261
Did it heal yet,
or is it still draining?

117
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:53,233
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you came back for seconds.

118
00:06:53,317 --> 00:06:56,348
I figured that
after that girl in the stairwell,
you'd be done for the night.

119
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,417
He's joking.

120
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,440
No Adam's apple, small hands.
It's no surprises this time.

121
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:04,726
I'll, uh, see you later.

122
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:08,019
Got a case.

123
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:10,802
Well,  you could've just said that.
You didn't have to screw with me.

124
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:13,795
Yeah, but if I didn't screw with you,
you'd spend the whole night
thinking you might get laid.

125
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,589
Which means you'd be useless.
Better to extinguish all hope.

126
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:19,568
Get Foreman and Cameron
and meet me upstairs, stat.

127
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:26,462
What's so urgent?

128
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:30,107
Two cases, same symptoms.

129
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:33,364
What do 6-year-olds and
70-year-olds have in common?

130
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:35,800
Their immune systems
don't work as well.
Could be listeria.

131
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,145
I already checked for that.

132
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,839
Leukemia has a higher prevalence
in both the young and old.

133
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:40,890
Cameron:
So does asthma.

134
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,337
House:
No, no, no.

135
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,098
They can both get diabetes.

136
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:45,243
N o.

137
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,737
The nearly dead and the newly bred
have more in common with each other
than with people in the middle.

138
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:54,581
It's weird.

139
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:56,668
Some kind of circle of life thing.

140
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,570
This kid doesn't have
kidney failure.

141
00:07:58,654 --> 00:07:59,239
He will.

142
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:02,363
Based on this file,
the kid just ate some bad food.

143
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,127
Was the old man--

144
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,517
They were nowhere near each other
in any of the four dimensions.

145
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:09,584
- This case is 12 years old.
- Yep.

146
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:12,956
- And this case is Cuddy's.
- She assigned it to me.

147
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,805
She agrees with you that
this is something more
than gastroenteritis?

148
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,483
She wouldn't have assigned it to me
if she did, now would she?

149
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,939
Gohhh.

150
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:29,259
What were we talking about?

151
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,565
Two patients with
two symptoms in common.

152
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,302
And five symptoms
not in common.

153
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:37,137
While you were all wearing your
"Frankie says relax" t-shirts,

154
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,322
I was treating
a 73-year-old woman

155
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:41,382
who went through this
progression of symptoms.

156
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,442
The last of which was...

157
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:50,972
In case any of you missed
that class in med school,
that one's untreatable.

158
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,494
Kid's got the first two.

159
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:55,901
Took Esther
an hour and 20 minutes
to go from two to three.

160
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:59,007
And less than a day to make it
all the way to the rear exit.

161
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:02,981
This is all because a child has
some blood in his diarrhea.

162
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,209
He's got a tummy ache.

163
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,600
If there was any reason to think
it was anything worse,
Cuddy would be all over it.

164
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,438
Great.
Do a colonoscopy.

165
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,208
On a six-year-old kid who
probably has nothing worse
than some food poisoning?

166
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,087
If you happen to
find any purple papules,
do me a favor and grab a slice.

167
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,465
I want to check
for Erdheim Chester.

168
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:22,858
A disease that there have been what,
maybe 200 reported cases of? Ever?

169
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,503
If Esther's family had
let me do an autopsy,

170
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:27,878
there'd be 201.

171
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,878
Foreman:
See anything?

172
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:44,102
Chase:
No, and I don't expect to.

173
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:47,372
House usually avoids cases.

174
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:50,628
If he's actually
stealing a case from Cuddy,
there's got to be a reason.

175
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:53,105
It's not the first time
I've seen this file.

176
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:56,123
About a month before
Cameron was hired,

177
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,386
some trucker came in here
with these symptoms.

178
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,057
House decided he was dying.

179
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:04,515
Two days and a spinal tap,
bone marrow extraction, and
three colonoscopies later,

180
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:09,274
we sent the guy home
with a bunch of pain killers and
a diagnosis of a bad cheese sandwich.

181
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:15,538
One of the guys who
worked here before me said House tried
to cure Esther at least three other times.

182
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:20,366
You know how people see
the Virgin Mary in Danishes and stuff?

183
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:23,957
Someone died 12 years ago,
and House doesn't know why.

184
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:31,178
House sees that case now
in paint peeling, in clouds,
and now in this poor kid.

185
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:34,736
Erdheim Chester is
an abnormal growth of some
of the cells that fight infection.

186
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:37,103
Is that cancer?
'Cause he seems okay now.

187
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:39,409
Yeah, the other doctor
kind of scared us about that.

188
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:42,402
He shouldn't have.
We're just testing.
It'll probably be negative.

189
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:43,336
Alan:
I don't understand.

190
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,966
You don't think that's what it is,
but you want to--

191
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:46,431
you want to do
this thing to him anyway?

192
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:47,379
We need to be sure.

193
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:48,916
Isn't there any other way?

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,530
It shouldn't take long.

195
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,658
All right.

196
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:55,865
Those ridges look a lot
like purple papules.

197
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:58,885
They're not purple, they're red.
They're probably just blood blisters.

198
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:03,269
Give me the biopsy needle.

199
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,126
How long is this going to take?

200
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:19,322
Forget it, Chase. Your
punching-out-the-shark story's good,
but she's not waiting for you.

201
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:21,611
So?

202
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:23,466
We couldn't confirm
the source of the bleeding.

203
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,632
- But we did biopsy some--
- Blood blisters.

204
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,066
You mean papules.

205
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:29,451
Come on, Cameron.
Who's right?

206
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:32,370
Chase is.

207
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,065
Negative for Erdheim Chester.

208
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,371
Let me see.

209
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:46,478
- If it's not Erdheim Chester--
- It's exactly what we said before.

210
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:50,065
Garden variety viral gastroenteritis.
Can we go back to the party?

211
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,835
Do a kidney biopsy.

212
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:54,847
Esther's shut down
in exactly--

213
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,244
Chase:
This kid is not Esther.

214
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,005
You screwed up,
she died. I'm sorry.

215
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,236
But that does not mean
this kid is dying as well.

216
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:01,255
Jeez.

217
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:03,551
You get testy when
you don't get any fuzz.

218
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,715
Come on.

219
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,343
What did the test say?

220
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:21,984
Chase:
Colonoscopy was clean.

221
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,421
And the biopsy was negative
for Erdheim Chester.

222
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:27,071
Alan:
So Ian's going to be all right.
It was just some sort of virus.

223
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,604
What's that?

224
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:31,544
Urine.

225
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,188
But it's brown.

226
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,480
Ian's kidneys
are shutting down.

227
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,228
Still think it's
not the same case?

228
00:12:54,316 --> 00:13:00,180
House:
So, what can cause bloody diarrhea,
ataxia, and kidney failure?

229
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,334
- I'll go do a biopsy.
- House: Forget it.

230
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:03,818
That battle's over.

231
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:07,980
His rising creatinine is
his kidneys' way of saying,
"Go on without me."

232
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,601
What explains everything?

233
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:18,330
E. Coli HO:157 causes
bloody diarrhea and leads to
hemolytic uremic syndrome.

234
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,925
Toxins from the bacteria
cause his kidneys to shut down.

235
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,655
We should start him
on plasmaphoresis.

236
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:26,421
Clear, concise,
and completely plausible.

237
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,529
And exactly what I did
last time. Didn't work.

238
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,687
- What else?
- Good Pasture's syndrome.

239
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:34,348
Circulating antibodies cause
kidney failure and bleeding.

240
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:35,903
But not the purple papules.

241
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:37,762
If you throw in
Esther's next symptom--

242
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:40,109
brain--makes me think
heavy metal toxicity.

243
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,286
His hematocrit would
have to be low. It's at 44, and

244
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:44,862
- Esther's never dropped below...
- 42.

245
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,172
You have the file memorized?

246
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:47,797
It's my lucky number.

247
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:48,991
What about lymphoma?

248
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,964
Causes kidney failure, GI bleed,
and can infiltrate the base of the brain.

249
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,465
You check Esther for that?

250
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:58,934
She never showed
any signs of...

251
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:04,229
If he has lymphoma
this far advanced, we should be
able to see it in his blood and brain.

252
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:08,829
Chase, run a blood smear
and immunochemistries.
Foreman, get an MRI.

253
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:11,988
- I'll page Cuddy.
- No, you won't.

254
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:13,563
She thinks the kid
has a stomach ache.

255
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:15,580
She'll come right up here
and do one of two things.

256
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:17,150
If she agrees with me,
I don't need her.

257
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:18,571
If she disagrees,
I don't want her.

258
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:20,624
Can't handle people
disagreeing with you?

259
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,968
She might have
a different take on this.

260
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:25,342
Subordinates can disagree
with me all they want. It's healthy.

261
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:28,062
People who can shut me down,
on the other hand...

262
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,076
Forget  Cuddy.
I'll have Wilson keep her busy.

263
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,237
[Phone rings]

264
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:42,482
Keep  your answers
short and discreet.
Is Cuddy still playing?

265
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:46,056
The chicken...
is still in Piccadilly Square.

266
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,867
Brilliant.

267
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:49,153
She'll never suspect that
Normandy is our target.

268
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,505
Is that House?

269
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:54,476
Tell him that the blinds
just went to 20/40, and
he's running out of chips.

270
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,315
House:
How's she doing?

271
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:56,584
Well, what's going on?

272
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,549
The way you took off,
something's obviously--

273
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:00,368
Love to chat.
But got a game to play.

274
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:01,577
How's she doing?

275
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:04,406
The patient is on life support.
We're about to pull the plug.

276
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,334
Are you talking about me?

277
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:06,594
What have you got?

278
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,942
Mmm... Those sound like
high-dose cardio meds.

279
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:11,247
Two hearts.

280
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:13,200
You got the flush?

281
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,379
Still waiting on the final labs.

282
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,217
She drinking her seltzer?

283
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:19,577
No. Hydration
is not a problem.

284
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:22,302
House:
Means she's bluffing.
Push her all in.

285
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,171
Call.

286
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,538
Two pair.

287
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,676
Show me your hearts.

288
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:35,620
Seven of clubs.

289
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,831
Oh, dear.
Sounds like I messed up.

290
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,812
You're gonna be stuck
with her for a while.

291
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,547
Talk to you soon.
[Hangs up]

292
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,071
Oh... Yes.

293
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,455
Why are you taking
a picture of his head?

294
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:04,074
We're looking
for lymphoma, but--

295
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:06,857
So it's not
Erdheim something.

296
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:09,554
And it's not his kidneys.
But his kidneys are failing.

297
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:11,105
What--
Where's Dr. Cuddy?

298
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,849
Dr. House
mentioned another case.

299
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:15,197
Is there another patient with
the same-- same thing that Ian has?

300
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,739
- Not...exactly.
- What does that mean?

301
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:22,221
Dr. House had a patient
a while back who exhibited
the same symptoms as your son.

302
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:24,359
Then you know
what's wrong?

303
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,608
No.

304
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,023
So what do you know?

305
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,600
We know the likely course
the disease will take.

306
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:31,038
Alan:
Which is?

307
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:34,523
- She had multiple system failures--
- What happened to her?

308
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:42,159
She died 24 hours
after her admission.

309
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:51,790
Mr. or Mrs. Alston,
would you mind giving me a hand?

310
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,144
He's having trouble sitting still.

311
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:58,587
It's impossible to get
the detail we need.

312
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:01,514
So I figured he might feel more
comfortable hearing your voices.

313
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,814
Ian, honey?

314
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:11,617
Just sit still.

315
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,782
You'll be done in a moment.
We're here with you.

316
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,552
I'm scared.

317
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:19,567
It's okay, honey. It's...

318
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:23,425
It's only a big camera.
It's going to take
a picture of your head.

319
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:27,214
You love it when I take your
picture at home, don't you?

320
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,324
Yeah.

321
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,579
And you have to hold still
for that too, right?

322
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:35,333
But this isn't like that.

323
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,358
I know it's scary, Ian.

324
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,247
But you can do it.

325
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,609
You're getting
to be so grown up.

326
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,446
So just...

327
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:51,957
hold perfectly still.
Just for a little bit.

328
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,179
Mommy, are you crying?

329
00:17:55,787 --> 00:18:00,112
No. No, honey.
I'm just tired.

330
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,685
Okay. I'll try.

331
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,183
The base of his brain has been
infiltrated by a small mass.

332
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:36,553
- We think--
- Pituitary?

333
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,333
Looks that way.

334
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:39,193
Explains
the low blood pressure.

335
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:44,197
Pretty much confirms
the lymphoma.

336
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,143
If we'd started Esther
on prednisone...

337
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:53,750
Uh, did anyone see
the lymphoma?

338
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,497
C ameron:
No, we saw a mass.
The location was consistent with--

339
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:58,332
Didn't see any
in the blood, either.

340
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,686
White blood cells show
no spindling or abnormal nuclei.

341
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,841
Nothing on
immunochemistries, either.
It's not lymphoma.

342
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,155
Foreman:
House.

343
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:42,408
It's a train.

344
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:44,765
We don't know
what kind of train.

345
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,293
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm thirsty.

346
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:47,689
It's closed.

347
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:53,328
It's not now.

348
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,470
We got one advantage.

349
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:03,120
We know where
the tracks are going.

350
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:05,506
The fact that the end
of the line is death...

351
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:07,012
is an advantage?

352
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,629
The fact that we know
is an advantage.

353
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,820
Means maybe we can
get ahead of it.

354
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:16,477
Next station is the liver. We've got...
About 90 minutes before it gets there.

355
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:19,662
Maybe we can cut down a tree
across the line just outside of town.

356
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:20,835
I'll do an ultrasound.

357
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:23,037
No, treatment will
tell us more, faster.

358
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,417
How can we start treatment if we have no idea what we'retreating for?

359
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:27,235
[Dishes clatter]
Treat him for everything.

360
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:31,197
Give him acetylcysteine.
And interferon. And silymarin.

361
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,893
And whatever else you can
think of to protect the liver.

362
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:45,096
[Phone rings]

363
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:48,976
What's going on?

364
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,649
Oh, just catching up
on some TV.

365
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:52,587
How are you doing?

366
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,397
Well, thanks to
your last consult,

367
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:56,145
the patient has
improved dramatically.

368
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:58,520
Tell House the patient is
about to kill the doctor.

369
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:01,252
- She says the pa--
- I heard. What d'ya got?

370
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:03,078
Well, Cuddy just
raised, and, uh...

371
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,446
- You're paired.
- What?

372
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:05,379
Nines?

373
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,105
How do you know?

374
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,997
Anything lower,
you wouldn't sound so excited.

375
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:13,411
Jacks or higher,

376
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,977
your voice sounds like
Debbie from accounting
is sitting in your lap.

377
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,127
Ask Cuddy if she can
beat a pair of threes.

378
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,696
Wait, what's--What's going on?

379
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,741
If you're going to mess with me,
wouldn't it be more fun to do it in person?

380
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,279
Yes, it would.

381
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,289
Um, can you beat
a pair of threes?

382
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:29,535
House:
What did she do?

383
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,824
I left orders
for PO fluids, doctor.

384
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:34,161
Enough with the codes.
She obviously knows it's me.

385
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:35,863
She's drinking her seltzer.

386
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:38,222
Did she stop?

387
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:39,907
- Yes.
- Go all in.

388
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,385
- Um...but...
- Just do it.

389
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:45,157
You couldn't care less
about this charity event.

390
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:47,069
You claim not to be
messing with me.

391
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,961
Obviously, you're either
trying to keep me--

392
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:49,952
Shut up.

393
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,618
Look, last time,
I wanted the game to go on.

394
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:53,698
I still do.

395
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,779
That means that this time,
you get to win.

396
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:56,894
Hold on.

397
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,413
I fold.

398
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,471
Ho, ho, ho.

399
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:16,286
House,
are you sure you're okay?

400
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:51,065
Meds seem to be working.
Liver's holding its own.

401
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,668
Good.

402
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:54,126
But the platelets are dropping.

403
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:55,215
Even better.

404
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:56,787
Why? It means
he's getting sicker.

405
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:59,449
It's new.
New is good.

406
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:02,838
Because old ended in death.

407
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:07,240
I can't breathe.

408
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:08,994
Chase!

409
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:10,193
What?

410
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:13,038
What's happening?

411
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:19,357
Ian. Come on.

412
00:23:20,018 --> 00:23:21,475
Honey, just relax.

413
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,493
Ian, breathe.
Come on, honey.

414
00:23:24,494 --> 00:23:27,217
Breathe,
please, honey.

415
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:54,330
[Crash!]

416
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,613
We had to put him
on a ventilator.

417
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:22,870
He's back
on Esther's path.

418
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,324
And we managed to
make the train skip a few stations.

419
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:30,406
Which means
that instead of 12 hours,
he's probably got less than two.

420
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:32,257
Which begs the question, why?

421
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:33,385
What did we do?

422
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:35,075
Acetylcysteine could
mess with the lungs.

423
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,840
Mess with them.
Not shut them down
in 20 minutes.

424
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:40,040
Interferon modulates
the immune system.

425
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:43,054
It could affect
cancer of the blood,
like one of the leukemias.

426
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:44,904
It doesn't speed them up,
it slows them down.

427
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,811
It slows down
all 500 of them?

428
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,394
Anybody know
where we can find
an oncologist at this hour?

429
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:58,711
What effects would
interferon have on leukemia?

430
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:01,250
Depends on what type.
Could make it better,
could make it worse.

431
00:25:01,362 --> 00:25:03,237
Four-year fellowship
to learn that.

432
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:07,882
Cuddy:
Tell House if he wants to play cards,
he should get his ass
back down here and play.

433
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,758
You hear that?

434
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,086
She wants me off the phone.
Means she's vulnerable.

435
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,804
Go all in.

436
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:16,171
But, um, the party's over
in less than three hours.

437
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:18,182
Cuddy:
It's over in less than two hours.

438
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:24,068
Which means you either have
three of a kind, or just 3s.

439
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,386
I'm guessing 3s.

440
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,871
I bet 500.

441
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,100
Go all in.

442
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,759
You obviously want to bust me.
Why would you--

443
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:36,016
Either you go all in, or

444
00:25:36,124 --> 00:25:39,044
I tell everybody in the building
that you wear toenail polish.

445
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:42,356
I'm all in.

446
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,861
I'll call.

447
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,797
I'm betting you have a pair of threes,
but even if you have three...

448
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:55,696
it's not going to beat trip nines.

449
00:25:57,396 --> 00:25:59,697
Oh. Oh, oh no.

450
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:00,613
Oh, no.

451
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:03,368
Oh, oh.
That's gotta hurt.

452
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:04,095
What happened?

453
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:06,180
I just killed two birds
with one straight.

454
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,219
Good-bye.

455
00:26:08,388 --> 00:26:09,857
Fine. Keep playing.

456
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:11,473
But I need you to
recommend a good oncologist.

457
00:26:11,557 --> 00:26:15,149
Because if I don't get one
up here in the next few minutes,
I got a dead six-year-old.

458
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,377
Wilson:
If you need help, ask.

459
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:21,462
These games are insane.

460
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,829
Games have
a higher success rate.

461
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:26,154
Well, I don't see anything
that looks like leukemia.

462
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:27,809
You do a bone marrow biopsy?

463
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:28,760
No time.

464
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:30,770
Even if there is
an occult blood cancer,

465
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:33,226
you wouldn't expect
interferon to make it worse.

466
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:34,744
Certainly not this fast.

467
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:36,605
What would move this fast?

468
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,753
Cameron:
Autoimmune diseases.

469
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:41,552
If his body's own defenses are
attacking him, then beefing them up
is just going to put fuel on the fire.

470
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:43,668
Sarcoidosis could be
in his brain and lungs.

471
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:46,400
No, no enlarged hilar lymph nodes
on his chest x-ray.

472
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:49,515
The systemic nature suggests
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.

473
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,907
Or Kawasaki's disease.

474
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:52,172
Can't be Kawasaki's.

475
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:54,052
Doesn't affect the elderly.

476
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:57,313
Uh, these...
This is a kid's x-ray.

477
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,410
House had another patient...

478
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:03,108
Who may or may not
have had Kawasaki's.

479
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:04,563
This kid,
on the other hand...

480
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:08,234
He makes antibodies that are
eating the inside of his arteries.

481
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,239
Choking off blood to
his major organs one by one.

482
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:15,323
First the GI tract, then the kidneys,
then the brain, now the lungs.

483
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:20,727
Can anyone think of a reason why
Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly?

484
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:22,992
Other than that it doesn't?

485
00:27:26,164 --> 00:27:26,712
Nice.

486
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:28,362
Foreman:
We can confirm with blood work.

487
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,087
We need an ANA, sed rate--

488
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:31,729
Labs will take two hours.

489
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:33,778
What was the old lady's sed rate?

490
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,520
House:
Elevated. 98.

491
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:39,380
You can't use another patient's labs
to diagnose Kawasaki's disease.

492
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:40,762
Is that like a dare
or something?

493
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:42,378
You don't have time
to be wrong.

494
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:43,167
Fine.

495
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,379
We'll look for Kawasaki
where he lives.

496
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,775
Ian's coronary arteries.

497
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,623
This other patient.

498
00:27:57,771 --> 00:28:01,027
The old lady. Esther?

499
00:28:04,054 --> 00:28:06,013
Have you read Moby Dick?

500
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:07,260
It was a book?

501
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:09,983
It was 10 years ago.
12.

502
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,654
Obsessionis dangerous.

503
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:14,559
Only if you're on a wooden ship
and your obsession is a whale.

504
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:15,944
I think I'm in the clear.

505
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,619
You do realize
it's a metaphor?

506
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:21,586
You do realize that
the point of metaphors is to scare people
from doing things by telling them that

507
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,741
something much scarier
is going to happen than
what will really happen.

508
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:28,476
God, I wish I had a metaphor
to explain that better.

509
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,182
Go back to the game.

510
00:28:30,328 --> 00:28:32,542
Don't worry.
I'm not going to
get eaten by witches.

511
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:40,601
Chase:
Coronary arteries clear.
No aneurysms.

512
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:42,741
Flip the mode.
Let's see the flow.

513
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:48,798
How did that other woman die?

514
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,728
She went into
respiratory distress.

515
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:54,558
Her heart and liver
were already com--

516
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,522
No.

517
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:59,095
Did she suffer?

518
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:01,523
Was she in pain?

519
00:29:01,946 --> 00:29:03,489
I don't know.

520
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:07,957
Laminar flow.

521
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,701
No blood clots,
no ragged edges.

522
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:12,601
Cameron:
Damn. Shut it down.

523
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:14,368
We're just wasting time.

524
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:21,589
Look at the right atrium.

525
00:29:21,674 --> 00:29:23,161
That's not Kawasaki's.

526
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:24,185
No.

527
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:26,648
Chase:
It's small. But it's there.

528
00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:28,976
Esther didn't have
a mass in her heart.

529
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,428
Ian's younger.

530
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:31,616
He can take
more of a pounding.

531
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,769
Esther died before
the disease reached her heart.

532
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,721
The disease made a mass
and made it fast.

533
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:36,933
Could be bacteria.

534
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:38,621
- Muscle.
- Connective tissue.

535
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:40,624
Hosue:
The kid can't take
any more theories.

536
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:43,789
Only thing we know is
that whatever that mass is,
that's what he's got.

537
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:45,877
We need a piece of it.

538
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:47,909
I'm doing a biopsy.

539
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:03,614
I'll shut the blinds.

540
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:05,136
No, let them watch.

541
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,133
I do my best work
on the big stage.

542
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,964
Passing through
the superior vena cava.

543
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:14,694
You're in the atrium.
Pull back.

544
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:17,909
You hit the wall of the heart.

545
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:22,761
These procedures would be so much simpler
if we could do them on healthy people.

546
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:26,436
And out again.

547
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:28,260
[Monitors start beeping]

548
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:30,864
- V. Fib.
- Cardiac arrest. Call it.

549
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:33,940
Come on. Paddles.

550
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:37,692
- Come on.
- Charging.

551
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:38,648
Clear.

[Overhead speaker]
"Code blue. ISO room."

553
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:47,439
And again.

554
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:52,829
- Nothing.
- Again.

555
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:09,326
Have you got
a clock on this?

556
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:11,254
How much longer
you going to be doing this?

557
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:12,875
Clear.

558
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:19,245
Wait. Got something.

559
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:23,418
He's back.

560
00:31:30,987 --> 00:31:32,043
Chase:
What are you doing?

561
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,761
I'm doing what
we came here to do.

562
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:36,321
- It almost killed him.
- I know. I was right here.

563
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:37,505
Give me a vacutainer.

564
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,943
His brain's been oxygen-deprived
for over eight minutes.

565
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:42,311
There might benothing left.
You might be--

566
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:45,178
Tell the parents.
Where the hell is that vacutainer?

567
00:31:56,757 --> 00:31:58,503
So. What's he got?

568
00:31:58,688 --> 00:31:59,709
Brain damage.

569
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,049
Good chance.
I was talking about before that.

570
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:03,158
You're not worried about--

571
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:05,839
Things I can't do anything about?
I try not to.

572
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:08,922
Things just roll off you
like water off a duck.

573
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:10,203
Histiocytosis.

574
00:32:10,287 --> 00:32:12,347
Very unlikely
in a 73-year-old.

575
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,717
Whatever this is,
is very unlikely.

576
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,191
Come on, more ideas.
Let's go, people.

577
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:19,546
Genetic disorders could
cause masses everywhere.

578
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:20,715
Tuberous sclerosis.

579
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,090
If it's genetic,
he's had it all his life.
Why now?

580
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,508
I don't know.
It sure fits nice enough.

581
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:27,391
We haven't ruled out leukemia yet.

582
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:30,418
Or sarcoma. He could have
multiple soft tissue tumors.

583
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:31,723
Foreman:
Or sarcoidosis.

584
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:34,895
- Multiple neurofibromatosis.
Foreman: Chondrocytomas.

585
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:38,608
How's it going?
You win?

586
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:41,996
I got called away
by the angry parents of a patient.

587
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:45,065
There are three of you here.
None of you had the sense to stop him.

588
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:47,412
- To pick up a phoneand call me.
- House: I told them you'd signed off.

589
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,054
The parents are mad
because their kid is dying.

590
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:51,295
It's understandable.

591
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,500
But if he doesn't die,
they won't be mad anymore.

592
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:55,850
If he's brain-damaged,
they might still be a little ticked.

593
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:59,162
- I had to do it to save him.
- You had to do it to diagnose Esther.

594
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:01,652
You may have killed
a six-year-old

595
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:05,059
because you're obsessed with
a woman who's been dead for 12 years.

596
00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:07,329
Sometimes you lose, House.
You're not God.

597
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:08,407
He's not dead yet.

598
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:11,048
No, but you're done with him.
It's my case now. Go home.

599
00:33:11,132 --> 00:33:13,785
Go ride your motorcycle.
Go brood in a dark room.

600
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,782
Just don't go near Ian again.

601
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:26,355
So, anything else?
Or is it just these seven?

602
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,704
Drop it, House. She's right.

603
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,038
No, she's not.

604
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,550
- You know she's not.
- We should have called her.

605
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:33,936
I'm surprised you didn't.

606
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:37,426
You're going to have to find a way
to let this go--we can't go near Ian.

607
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,003
We don't need to go near him.

608
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:41,214
We have his tumor.

609
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:44,392
Cuddy may be right that
we screwed up the protocol.

610
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:46,712
She may be right about
my screwed-up obsession.

611
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:49,186
But I am right
about the medicine.

612
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:51,509
How many tests
can we do with that?

613
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:52,237
[Sighs]

614
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,955
Look, we cure the kid,
we solve everybody's problems.

615
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,261
How many?

616
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:02,356
- Maybe two good pieces.
- How many okay pieces?

617
00:34:03,229 --> 00:34:04,845
Three would be pushing it.

618
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:09,909
Three tests, seven choices.

619
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:12,220
Okay, what's first?

620
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:15,123
Uh...sarcoidosis
seems most likely.

621
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,565
Yeah, so likely that
Cuddy's going to think of
that all on her own.

622
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:20,824
She's got the kid's
whole body to play with.

623
00:34:20,908 --> 00:34:23,202
Let her do that test.
What's next?

624
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:25,582
It's moving too fast
to be spreading.

625
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,477
It has to be growing from
something that's already--

626
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,368
Genetic disorder--
Tuberous sclerosis.

627
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:32,512
Or it's his immune system.
Histiocytosis.

628
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:37,609
There are more documented cases
of histio amongst older people
than tuberous sclerosis.

629
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:38,843
Let's start with that.

630
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:47,216
Wing or drumstick?

631
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,740
Gonna need a little
more than that.

632
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:52,331
A little more is
more than a third.

633
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:55,779
If we have to repeat this test
because you didn't cut us enough...

634
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:04,797
Chase:
I'm adding one microliter
of the immunoperoxidase.

635
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:05,681
Make it two.

636
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:09,454
I don't want House biting off our heads
because we weren't sure if it turned red or not.

637
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:18,137
Cameron:
That's definitely not red.

638
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,849
The problem could still be
an abnormal cell growth,
but a different cell line.

639
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:29,403
Foreman:
Sarcoma? Muscle cells are
throughout his body.

640
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,604
Would explain the geography.

641
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,735
Cameron:
Genetic disorder is
far more likely in a six-year-old.

642
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,906
Tuberous sclerosis.

643
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,956
Pretty unlikely
to cause a GI bleed.

644
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,408
The time course fits.

645
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:40,106
So, Foreman,
you agree with both of them.
Thanks for playing.

646
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,694
If we have enough tissue
for two tests, why not do both?

647
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:44,109
Then we don't have to
think as hard.

648
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:47,325
Taking the pressure off the choice
makes us less likely to think critically.

649
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:50,268
Sarcoma is more likely to hita 6- and a 70-year-old.

650
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:51,774
Tuberous sclerosis it is.

651
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:53,728
You think
sarcoma is less likely?

652
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,722
It's more likely.

653
00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:57,875
The test for it,
on the other hand, is less reliable.

654
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,406
Cameron:
Nestin's negative.

655
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,515
Well, that's okay.

656
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,900
If the tumor cells haven't matured,
the Ki-67 protein wouldn't have turned off.

657
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:20,556
What happens
if we don't solve this?

658
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:23,505
- The kid dies.
- I mean for the next 12 years.

659
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:27,486
Ki-67's negative.

660
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:33,667
And PCH antigen is negative.

661
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,168
Mighty Casey's
down to his last strike.

662
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:49,017
Mighty Casey struck out.

663
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,897
Thanks a lot. I was going to
read that this weekend.

664
00:36:51,997 --> 00:36:53,006
Cameron:
Chondrocytoma.

665
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,546
Connective tissue has been
in all the places we've been looking.

666
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,191
The kid is too sick for that.
We're better off testing for sarcoma.

667
00:36:58,275 --> 00:37:00,927
We would have seen signs of that
when we tested for tuberous sclerosis.

668
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,313
Tumor cells look like muscle
under the microscope.

669
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:05,372
No, they didn't.
They looked like fat.

670
00:37:07,044 --> 00:37:09,497
I vote for
neurofibromatosis.

671
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:11,048
Why?

672
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:13,360
Because the other choices
suck worse.

673
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:22,939
Give me a minute.

674
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:55,088
You want me out of here?

675
00:37:57,139 --> 00:37:58,976
You come up with anything?

676
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:02,846
No.

677
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,598
Hey.

678
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:32,791
We can talk about it tomorrow.

679
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:41,883
I, um...

680
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:46,087
I won the poker tournament.

681
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,263
I totally played this guy Berman
from business affairs.

682
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,541
I got great cards.
But I don't bet. Just call, no raises.

683
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,899
Berman pairs his King on the flop.

684
00:38:57,006 --> 00:39:01,114
I keep calling,
the river turns, I check.

685
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:05,728
He can't stand it. He goes all in.
He's sure he's won.

686
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:11,031
I call, I flip 'em. Pow!

687
00:39:11,212 --> 00:39:12,391
Pocket aces.

688
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:15,176
I nailed his ass.

689
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,755
The aces were hiding all along.

690
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:36,912
Test him for
Erdheim Chester disease.

691
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:39,299
Erdheim Chester?
That's not even on the list.

692
00:39:39,384 --> 00:39:41,025
Because we already did it.

693
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,208
He tested negative.

694
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:43,108
So did Esther.

695
00:39:43,192 --> 00:39:44,411
The disease lied.

696
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:47,632
Yeah,
the tumor's got it in for you.
Diseases don't lie.

697
00:39:47,716 --> 00:39:50,046
Fine, it didn't lie.
It slow played us.

698
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,649
We biopsied the colon, but
it hadn't reached the GI tract yet.

699
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,128
It's there now.

700
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:56,709
It's in his liver, his lungs...

701
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:58,532
You want it to be there.

702
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:00,917
Because then you didn't
screw up 12 years ago.

703
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:05,154
We can't waste our one test
on the one disease we know it's not.

704
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,416
Run the test.

705
00:40:20,892 --> 00:40:22,202
You sure about this?

706
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,139
Wait, let me think about that.

707
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:25,432
Don't pressure me.

708
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:27,616
Just run the damn test.

709
00:40:30,276 --> 00:40:32,407
Cameron:
Cells look like macrophages.

710
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:33,910
That's a good start.

711
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,285
Take your time
and say it loud.

712
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:54,454
CD 68 positive.

713
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,698
Start the treatment.

714
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:10,595
So Esther can
rest peaceful now, huh?

715
00:42:11,236 --> 00:42:12,273
Yeah.

716
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:20,159
40.

717
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,186
You got lucky.

718
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,427
You gonna call?

719
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:31,493
What I do...

720
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:34,725
is not just based
on the flip of a card.

721
00:42:34,977 --> 00:42:37,659
You guessed.
You got lucky.

722
00:42:37,743 --> 00:42:38,693
It fit.

723
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:41,778
It could just as easily have been
sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.

724
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:44,255
No, not just as easily.

725
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:47,125
Maybe not.
But it wasn't impossible.

726
00:42:50,512 --> 00:42:51,813
Are you going to call?

727
00:42:53,742 --> 00:42:54,614
You know,

728
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:56,641
relative to its size,

729
00:42:56,743 --> 00:43:00,281
the barnacle has
the largest penis of any animal.
