nothing but clinic work.

I just said...

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,140
You were lying.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,010
Well, then why'd you ask?

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,310
Because if you told the truth

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,650
I was only gonna give you
one day of clinic duty.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,950
That's dishonest.

participate in this...

I can put you back.

I have a runny nose.

But I don't.

18
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,000
I think I have
syphilis or gonorrhea.

19

Those of you who stayed
obviously do not have colds.

25
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,370
You will be
assigned to a doctor
who is not me,

of wiping crotches.

No, I'm good. Thanks.

I have the sedative.
Little late.

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,680
Just in time.

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,320
What did you give him?
A paralytic.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,660
CUDDY: Why would you do that?

42
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,960
Somebody had to
stop the screaming.

43
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,730
Then he's still in pain.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,460
Yeah. But quietly.

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,400
Paralytic's
stopped him breathing.

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,200
If he goes hypoxic,
he's gonna be quiet forever.

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,440
So either I can continue
to swab people's privates

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,950
or I can figure out
if this guy's delirium, pain

49
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,950
and insanely high heart rate
are life-threatening

50
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,010

is the better for

53
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,490
It took five CCs
of haloperidol

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,530
to get him down after
the paralytic wore off.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,260
So, pain in his right ear,
psychotic behavior
and dizziness. Go.

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,740
Nurses said he was
holding his head.

57
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,740
How do you know
it was specifically
his ear?

58
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,040
Because he was dizzy.

59
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,800
Means the problem was
affecting his inner ear.

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,280
Nurses said he was
running in circles.

61
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,570
Doesn't mean he was dizzy.

62
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,010
He wasn't running in circles.

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,450
He was running in oblongs.

64
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,510
Looked like
a three-year-old kid
drew them.

a hemorrhage.

69
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,960
If it explains everything...

70
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,430
Might not explain everything.

71
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,430
Well, what if he
was psychotic first,

72
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,430
then self-mutilated,
damaged the ear.

73
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,730
Excellent.

00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,970

what Foreman...

77

Say something else.

78
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,240
He came to the clinic.

79
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,210
Good.

80
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,980
Decent chance he had
a chronic illness first,

81
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,110
especially given
the rapid heart rate.

82
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,560
Lingering ear infection,
pressure builds up
in his inner ear,

83
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,890
bursts through
the mastoid bone

84
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,150
while he's
waiting in the clinic.

85
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,490
Oh, yes!

86
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,190
Get a head CT.
Draw blood cultures.

87
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,960
Run a chem panel
and get a complete
blood count.

88
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,060
Oh, while you're at it,
pour some alcohol into his ear

89
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,070
and take out the cockroach.

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,730
He has
a cockroach in his ear?

91
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,210
He was scratching
that ear

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
right before the event,
so I took a peek.

93
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,810
My guess is it
started biting.

94
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,280
Nothing else wrong with him?

95
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,910

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,980
Or they're poor
and desperate,

180
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,480
which is why
this place is here.

181
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,480
If they're that poor,
then they'd rather
have 50 bucks than...

182
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,640
(COUGHS)

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,450
Can I have the money?

184
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,350
Look. It's monogrammed!

185
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,480
He doesn't need money.
Ergo, he's not sick.

186
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,150
And the blood?

187
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,320
Could be anybody's.

188
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,120
Monogram's definitely his.

189
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,060
We need to talk.

190
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,300
Doesn't matter what
you say, do or threaten,
I will find a way out.

191
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,730
How can we make this
more interesting for you?

192
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,300
How can we make
the sky green?

193
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,810
How can we make
the tall short?

194
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,470
You cannot make
the uninteresting
interesting.

195
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,210
I'll pay you 10 dollars
for every patient

196
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,180

without touching.

197
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,420
You pay me 10 dollars
for every one
you have to touch.

198
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,660
You're making this
into a game for me.

199
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,280
From which I
can only conclude
this isn't a game for you.

200
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,490
No.

201
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,220
Why? You think if I
deal with enough people
I'll find some humanity?

202
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,360
Yes.

203
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,870
Why do I have to
do this myself?

204
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,900
I got a bum leg. Say, "Ah."

205
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,170
Ah.

206
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,280
Feels rough.

207
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,810
Yes. It's a rash.
I'm gonna need
more than "rough."

208
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,950
Well, it... It's just rough.
Can't you feel it?

209
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,680
Well, I could.

210
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,160
But then what
satisfaction would you get?

211
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,120
Got it!

212
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,360
Start counting.

213
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,970
How many?

214
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,400
Twenty-six.

Okay. Either you suck at math
or you're gonna
die in two seconds.

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,000

No. But you will.

in here for an STD test

House, you committed to...

253
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,870
She was raped.

You think I'm
the right doctor for her?

We've assigned
another doctor to your care.

I didn't mean to
upset Dr. House.

257
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,860
He knows that.
That's not why
we're doing this.

258
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,920
I'd like to keep
being treated by him.

deal with somebody

I'm fine.

00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,040
You told Dr. House
it's been less than a week.

264
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,270
You haven't told
anyone other than him.

No.

You think Dr. House does?

Whoa, whoa! You're gonna
cut him open? Right here?

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,360

What did she say to you?
Nothing.

367
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,110
I gave her
a couple of sedatives,
turned around,

368
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,210
and she grabbed
the whole bottle.
You must have said something.

369
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,450
I said plenty.
She said nothing.

370
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,050
I was with her
for over an hour.

371
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,820
She didn't say one word.

Why would you tell me that?

'Cause I don't
like hypocrisy.

She knows she wants you.
You were the first person
she spoke to about this.

The fact that I
was in the wrong
place at the wrong time

talk about the weather,

You might not want to
phrase it quite that way.

You need to get her to
talk about what happened.

Pretending it
didn't happen...

Wrong.
Pretending this didn't happen

425
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,030
is the best thing
she could possibly do.

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,300

428
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,040

real or process?

The few decent
moments in our lives.

430
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,570
Not the crap.

431
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,310
Maybe you're right.
Except there's no way

432
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,010
she can pretend
this didn't happen.

433
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,710
So she has no choice
but to process it.

434

what happened.

You don't
really want to hear.

00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,820

This doesn't have
to destroy your life.

439
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,290
I know.

440
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,170
It doesn't mean
anything about you.

441
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,970
It wasn't your fault.

442
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,470
I know.

443
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,970
You did nothing wrong.

444
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,840
Some jerk hurt you.
That's all.

445
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,240
I know.

446
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,910
You're worried that you can
never trust men again.

447
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,040
No.

448
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,140
Statistically,
there was always
a chance this could happen.

449
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,650

doesn't change anything.

The world doesn't
suck any more today
than it did yesterday.

451
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,950
I know all that.

452
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,580
Well, then what do
you want me to tell you?

453
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,220
Nothing. I just want to talk.

454
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,330
About nothing.
If we talk about nothing,
nothing will change.

455
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,960
It might.

456
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,500
How?

457
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,830
Time.

458
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,540
Time changes everything.

459
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,810
That's what people say.
It's not true.

460
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,210
Doing things changes things.

461
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,640
Not doing things leaves things
exactly as they were.

00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,950
Why do you have to suffer?

463
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,020
I gave my word.

464
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,490
Who would make
you promise that?

465
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,970
My father.

466
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,710
He said I would die
alone and miserable.

467
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,070
That's not a promise.

468
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,770
And even if it was,
he's dead.

469
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,170
And even if he's not,
he's not going to care if...

470
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,680
Why did your husband
have to suffer?

471
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,950
How do you know
about my husband?

472
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,810
Well, I just know.

473
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,020
You have to die in pain

474
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,620
because of a promise
you made to your father?

475
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,060
If I say "yes,"
you'll use that
as proof that I'm insane.

476
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,200
Force treatment on me.

477
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,500
Did the nurse tell you
about my husband?

478
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,940
No.

Yes.

480
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,180
It's under control.

481
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,520
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to freak you out.

482
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,850
Why?

483
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,260

to remember me.

That's not rational.

makes sense to you.

Why do you care
what you say to her?

508

answer these questions.

It's a simple question.
"Has your life sucked?"

Tell her the truth.
Tell her you were shot.
Tell her...

511
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,620
She doesn't want
to hear the truth.

512
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,980
She's looking for something.

513
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,320
Looking to
extrapolate some...

514
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,880
She's looking to
connect with you.

515
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,620
And that's what's
scaring the hell
out of you.

516
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,320
Tell her the truth.

517
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,060
There is no truth.

She's not asking
for test results.

521
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,930
She's not asking what
two plus two equals.

522
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,100
She's asking for my
personal life experience

523
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,200
so she can extrapolate
to all humanity.

524
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,770
That's not truth.
It's bad science.

525

It's not science at all.
Tell her the truth.

has been good.

00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,020
Tell her anyway.
She wants hope.

529
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,250
She wants to know that
what happened to her
wasn't the norm.

530
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,660
That things can be okay,

531
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,430
which means
maybe they can be
okay for her again.

532
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,630
Tell her your life sucked.

533
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,930
It didn't.

534
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
Tell her anyway.

535
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,840
She wants to know
she's not alone.

536
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,670
She wants to know
she's gonna survive this.

537
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,400
That other people
have been through this

538
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,100
and worse and come
out the other end.

539
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,200
She wants to know if
she's going to heal.

540
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,580
Act like you've healed.

541
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,420
Tell her...

542
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,350
Keep her asleep.

543
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,290
Thanks. You all
have been a huge help.

544
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,560
There's no wrong answer.

545
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,890
Because there's
no right answer.

546
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,900
Wrong.

547
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,500
We just don't know
what the right answer is.

548
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,040
Wake up.

549
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,450
It's not as bad as
what happened to you.

550
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,010
I don't think.

551
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,680
I don't know what
happened to you.

552
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,290
But given how lousy
you're responding,

553
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,890
I assume it was worse than
getting abused by
your grandmother.

554
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,300
What did she do to you?

555
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,070
Parents traveled a lot.

556
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,870
They'd leave me with her.

557
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,240
She liked things
the way she liked them.

558
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,370
And she believed
in discipline.

559
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,670
She was right, I suppose,

560
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,980
because I hardly ever
screwed up
when she was around.

561
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:19,460
Too scared of getting forced
to sleep in the yard
or take a bath in ice.

562
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,030
Your turn.

563
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,330
Your parents,
they never stopped her?

564
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,570
I never told them.

565
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,340
Why not?

566
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,170
Usual reasons.

567
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,770
I was afraid they
wouldn't believe me.

568
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,840
I was afraid they'd think
I'd done something wrong.

569
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,610
I opened up to you.
You open up to me.

570
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,350
What did you call her?

571
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,480
Oma.

572
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,690
And you kept calling
her that after this?

573
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,030
Dutch for "grandmother."
She was still my grandmother.

574
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,000
And she was still Dutch.

575
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,440
Is any part of
that story true?

576
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,010
All of it.

577
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,100
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma.

578
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,170
Something would
have to change.

579
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,410
You don't know me.

580
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,710
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma!

581
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,940
Look, you're over-reacting...

582
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,110
Do not dismiss me.

583
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,580
I'm not dismissing you.

584
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,020
I'm saying you're
not acting rationally.

585
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,990
I'm angry because
you are lying to me!

586
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,620
No, you are...
What can I do?

587
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,250
What the hell can I do
that you're not gonna dismiss

588
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,730
as just being
because I was raped?

589
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,900
Nothing.

590
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,910
Your story, is it true?

591
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,840
True for somebody.

592
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,510
But not for you.

593
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,250
These things happen.

594
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,580
It happened to somebody.

595
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,380
What do you care
if it happened to me?

596
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,820
They're not in this room.

597
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,250
No, they're out there!

598
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,810
Doctors, lawyers,
postal workers.

599
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,160
Some of them doing great,
some of them doing lousy.

600
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,920
You gonna base
your whole life

601
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,620
on who you got
stuck in a room with?

602
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,330
I'm gonna base this moment
on who I'm stuck
in a room with.

603
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,400
It's what life is.
It's a series of rooms.

604
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,680
And who we get stuck
in those rooms with

605
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,040
adds up to what
our lives are.

606
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,520
CUDDY: House?

607
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,560
You gotta get me out of this.

608
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,330
There's nothing to diagnose.
There's nothing...

609
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,640
You only tested her for STDs?

610
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,270
I had seven morons
who forgot their raincoats.

611
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,810
It's all they asked for
so I didn't waste
the lab's time. Why?

612
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,750
I wasted their time.
She's pregnant.

613
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,590
Do you understand?

614
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,670
Are you okay?

615
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,960
I mean,
I know you're not okay.

616
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,510
But are you more
or less not okay

617
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,510
than you were
five minutes ago?

618
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,100
About the same.

619
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,610
Good.

620
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,950
The termination
procedure isn't pleasant...

621
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,950
I don't want to terminate.

622
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,110
You want to keep the baby?

623
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,680
Abortion is murder.

624
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,660
True. It's a life.
And you should end it.

625
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,230
Every life is sacred.

626
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,170
Talk to me. Don't
quote me bumper stickers.

627
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,830
It's true.
It's meaningless.

628
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,670
It means every life
matters to God.

629
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,640
Not to me, not to you.

630
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,680
And judging by the number
of natural disasters,
not to God either.

631
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,880
You're just
being argumentative.

632
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,510
Yeah. I do do that.

633
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,710
What about Hitler?

634
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,480
Was his life sacred to God?

635
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,920
The father of your child?

636
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,290
Is his life sacred to you?

637
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,190
My child isn't Hitler.

638
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,060
Either every life
is sacred or...

639
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,620
Stop it!

640
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,160
I don't want to
chat about philosophy!

641
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,670
You're not
killing your rape baby
because of a philosophy.

642
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,660
It's murder.
I'm against it. You for it?

643
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,600
Not as a general rule.

644
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,080
Just for unborn children?

645
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,270
Yes.

646
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,020
The problem with exceptions
to rules is the line-drawing.

647
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,320
It might make
sense to kill the ass
that did this to you,

648
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,150
but then where do
we draw the line?

649
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,990
Which asses do
we get to kill?

650
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,390
Which asses get to
keep on being asses?

651
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,260
The nice thing about
the abortion debate

652
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,130
is we can
quibble over trimesters

653
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,100
but ultimately there's
a nice clean line, birth.

654
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,640
Morally there's not
a lot of difference.

655
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,510
Practically, huge.

656
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,680
You're enjoying
this conversation.

657
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,450
It's just the type of
conversation I do well.

658
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,450
But the other type?

659
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,190
The personal stuff?

660
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,690
There are no answers.

661
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,970
And if there are no answers,
why talk about it?

662
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,700
You're healthy.
You shouldn't be here.

663
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,540
I don't want to go.

664
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,580
Fine. I won't discharge you.

665
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,920
Wanna go for a walk?

666

(GROANS)

667
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,130
It's the last of my journey.

668
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,400
You don't deserve pain.
You're just
an insane old man.

669
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,600
No. No.
I am not going to
watch you suffer.

670
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,230
I need you to remember me.

671
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,830
I'll remember you!

672
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,970
Why?

673
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,310
Because you're a nice man.

674
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,370
You don't know that.
You don't know
anything about me.

675
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,180
Either you were a nice man
or you were an ass.

676
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,980
Either way you did
something to somebody

677
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,750
that they're
going to remember.

678
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,290
I have no family.
I have no friends.

679
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,090
I didn't even
have a real job.

680
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,860
If I die in peace,

681
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,760
then I'm just
another patient.

682
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,390
But if I die suffering...

683
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,800
It'll be horrible. Don't
do that to either of us.

684
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:43,040
No. I just need to
die knowing that
something is different

685
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,910
because I was here.

689
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,510
Life goes on.

690
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,720
Is that the reason
why we're out here?

691
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,920
Know why I come here?

692
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,090
I sit. I watch. I imagine.

693
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,600
Sounds nice.

694
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,700
I imagine that one of
them will break a leg.

695
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,840

one crack in the sidewalk...

You don't really.

697
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,740
I'm evil.

698
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,480
Evil people don't
say they're evil.

699
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,880
That sounds like
an easy loophole.

700
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,650
People can do good things,
but their instincts
are not good.

701
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,260
Either God doesn't exist
or he's unimaginably cruel.

702
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,730
I don't believe that.

703
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,220
What do you believe?

704
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,300
Why do you
think this happened?

705
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,300
I don't want to
talk about it.

706
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,930
Me neither. Too bad.

707
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,110
You know, I don't think
there was a reason.

708
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,740
So God does exist,
lets you get raped,

709
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,790
needs you to keep
your rape baby for no reason.

710
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,850
Maybe he was challenging me.

711
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,230
He hurts you to help you.

712
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,000
Well, I guess it's better
than because he hates you.

713
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,900
You're trying to convince me
there's no God.

714
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,490
Why would you even say
something like that?

715
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,060
Because you're
throwing your life away.

716
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,610
I'm doing what I believe!

717
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,940
What you believe
doesn't make sense.

718
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,100
This is not helping me.

719
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,870
Then I can't help you.

720
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,650
If you believe in eternity,
then life is irrelevant.

721
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,850
The same way that
a bug is irrelevant

722
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,820
in comparison
to the universe.

723
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,150
If you don't
believe in eternity,

724
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,170
then what you do here
is irrelevant.

725
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,830
Your actions here
are all that matters.

726
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,340
Then nothing matters.

727
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,600
There's no
ultimate consequences.

728
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,470
I couldn't live like that.

729
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,580
So, you need to think
that the guy

730
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,170
who did this to you is
going to be punished?

731
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,710
I need to know that
it all means something.

732
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,650
I need that comfort.

733
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,860
Yeah.
Are you feeling comfortable?

734
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,390
You feeling good right now?
You feel warm inside?

735
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:06,840
I was raped.
What's your excuse?

736
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,620
(MONITOR FLATLINING)

737
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,200
(EXHALES)

738
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,840
Do you think the guy who did
this to me feels bad?

739
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,740
Would that help you?
Make you feel better?

740
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,610
Why do you always do that?

741
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,110
Ask why I'm asking questions
instead of just
answering the question?

742
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,210
The answer
doesn't interest me.

743
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,480
I don't care
what he's feeling.

744
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,180
I'm interested in
what you're feeling.

745
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,060
You are?

746
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,930
I'm trapped in
the room with you, right?

747
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,070
Why did you choose me?

748
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,570
There's something about you.

749
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,980
It's like you're hurt, too.

750
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,560
It was true.

751
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,170
What was?

752
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,440
It wasn't my grandmother.
But it was true.

753
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,150
Who was it?

754
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,450
It was my dad.

755
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,340
I'd like to tell you
what happened to me now.

756
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,880
I'd like to hear it.

757
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,380
It was my friend's
birthday party...

758
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,860
<i>(GREY ROOM</i> PLAYING)

759
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,010
She terminated.
She's been discharged.

760
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,740
She's going to be okay.

761
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,910
Yeah. It's that simple.

762
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,620
She's talking
about what happened.

763
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,050
That's huge. You did good.

764
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,490
And everyone'll tell you
that's what we
gotta make her do.

765
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,730
We got to help her, right?
Except we can't.

766
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:27,070
We drag out her story,
tell each other that
it'll help her heal

767
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,280
and feel real good
about ourselves.

768
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,040
Maybe all we've done
is make a girl cry.

769
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,640
Then why did you...

770
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,010
(BALL THUDDING)

771
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,020
Because I don't know.

772
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,490
You gonna follow up with her?

773
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,500
One day, one room.
