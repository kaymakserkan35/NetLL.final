1
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,947
Hey,  Maddie.

2
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,436
Listen, I, uh, hate to pull you away,

3
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,123
But I'm gonna need you to come
back to the office with me.

4
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:34,727
Really?

5
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,627
Yeah, it turns out I got to
file those docs by midnight.

6
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,177
I'm gonna need you to, um...

7
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,587
This isn't working at all, is it?

8
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,057
No, it's not, Nate.

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,227
Listen, I've had a couple.

10
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,107
I shouldn't really drive.

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,137
Could you just give me a lift
--  I already called you a cab.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,517
I'll see you in the morning.

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,557
Does that happen a lot?

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,867
Only on the days that end with a Y.

15
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,607
You okay?

16
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,827
Yeah.

17
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,867
I've got to go.

18
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,327
Here is the detective

19
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,547
That's a pretty nasty bite.

20
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,457
You know what bit him?

21
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,167
I haven't quite
determined that just yet.

22
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,657
Come on, doc.

23
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,057
Off the record.

24
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,227
Okay, way, way off the record.

25
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,337
If I didn't know better, I'd say
the guy was attacked by a wolf.

26
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,117
But unless I know that the zoo is missing
one of their lobos, I'm going with pit bull.

27
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,787
I like my job.

28
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,977
Yeah, I hear you.

29
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,977
One more thing.

30
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,777
This guy -Was his heart missing?

31
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,107
Yeah, how did you know that?

32
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,637
I haven't even finished my report.

33
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,157
Lucky guess.

34
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,017
This lawyer guy first
heart-Free corpse in town?

35
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,277
First man.

36
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,707
Over the past year, several
women have gone missing.

37
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,107
Dead bodies all washed up later in the bay,
too deteriorated to draw firm conclusions.

38
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,357
But no hearts. No hearts

39
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,117
They were all hookers
working at hunter's point.

40
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,912
Cops are trying to
keep things under wrap,

41
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:32,527
But they're looking for a serial
killer. And the lunar cycle?

42
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,927
Yeah, month after month, all the murders
happened in the week leading up to the full moon.

43
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,197
Which is this week. There is the lawer

44
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,447
Awesome.

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,987
Dean, could you be a
bigger geek about this?

46
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,231
I'm sorry, man, but what
about a human by day,

47
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:48,269
A freak animal killing machine
by moonlight don't you understand?

48
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:51,914
We haven't seen one since we were kids.

49
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,407
Okay, sparky.

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,707
Then you know what?

51
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,842
After we kill it, we can go to disneyland.
Know what the best part about it is?

52
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:01,965
We already know how to
bring these suckers down.

53
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,867
So what's our next move?

54
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,717
Talk to the girl who found the body.

55
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,507
Madison: I don't understand.

56
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,947
I already gave my statement to you.

57
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,427
Well, we just need to
verify a few things.

58
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,627
This is my neighbor glenn.
Glenn, this is detective...

59
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,913
Landis. And detective dante.

60
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,087
Well, guess I'll leave you to it.

61
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:23,628
Okay.

62
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:25,087
Thanks for the casserole.

63
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,327
Oh, how thoughtful.

64
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,517
Just call if you need anything.

65
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,027
He's sweet.

66
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,927
He came over to check on me.

67
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,177
Have a seat.

68
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,637
You must be pretty shaken up.

69
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,307
You were nate mulligan's
assistant, right?

70
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,307
For two years, yeah.

71
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,997
So you knew all about him.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,287
Probably knew more
about him than he did.

73
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,297
Nate was...

74
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,907
He was nice.

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,287
But...

76
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,711
You get a few scotches in him, and he
started hitting on anyone in a 5-Miles radius.

77
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,657
You know the type.

78
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,067
Yeah. I do, actually.

79
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,367
Did, uh, did he have any
enemies? What do you mean?

80
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,164
Sure looked like an animal attack.

81
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,417
We're just covering all the bases.

82
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,640
Anyone that might have
had a beef with him

83
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:21,388
Former client, an ex. What?

84
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,045
Well, this is embarrassing,

85
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,773
But my ex-Boyfriend, kurt.

86
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:26,340
Kurt have a last name? Mueller

87
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:28,287
After we broke up, he went kind of nuts.

88
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,447
He's...

89
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,867
Well, he's kind of been stalking me.

90
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,077
He got it in his head that something
was going on between Nate and I.

91
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,667
He showed up at my office.

92
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,484
And what happened? Kurt
got into it with nate.

93
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:41,456
Threw a punch before security grabbed
him. I was lucky to keep my job.

94
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,717
When was the last time you saw kurt?

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,817
A few nights ago.

96
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,487
Actually, the night Nate died.

97
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,277
We were all grabbing drinks at
this bar, and Kurt showed up.

98
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,117
And?

99
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,037
Nothing.

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,637
It was...

101
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,677
Like he was watching me.

102
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,167
Then he was gone.

103
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,597
Tell you the truth...

104
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,957
He scares me.

105
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,717
So, what do you think?

106
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,797
Stalker ex-Boyfriend.

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,037
He hates the boss.

108
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,287
And he was there that night.

109
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,687
Think he's our dog-Faced boy?

110
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,827
Well, it's a theory.

111
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,777
We've had worse.

112
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,947
What do you say we pay kurt a visit?

113
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,967
Nothing but leftovers and a six-Pack.

114
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,677
Check the freezer.

115
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,057
Maybe there's some human hearts
behind the haagen-Dazs or something.

116
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,507
Sam, come here.

117
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,337
Check it out.

118
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,347
Somebody there?

119
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,387
I'll call 911.

120
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,777
I'd say Kurt's looking
more and more like our cujo.

121
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,737
If he's out here, we
better check on Madison.

122
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,497
What's going on?

123
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,517
Police business, glenn.

124
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,677
What is it?

125
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,077
Well, maybe we should talk privately?

126
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,267
Has kurt been here?

127
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,007
Not exactly.

128
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,087
What exactly does "not exactly" mean?

129
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,377
Well, he was outside
last night -Just looking.

130
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,617
Just looking at me.

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,697
Has he done something?

132
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,347
We're not really sure.
It's probably nothing.

133
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,427
But...

134
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,767
We just don't want to take any chances.

135
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,939
In fact, one of us should
probably stay here with you,

136
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,669
Just in case he stops by.

137
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,297
Where does he work? He owns a body shop.

138
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:08,217
You mind grabbing that
address for us? Thanks.

139
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,107
All right, you go.I'll stay.
You go after the creepy ex.

140
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,407
I'm gonna hang here with the hot chick.

141
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,637
Why do you always get to
hang out with the girls?

142
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,067
Because I'm older.

143
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,627
No, screw that. We settle
this the old-Fashioned way.

144
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,797
Dean, always with the scissors.

145
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,227
Shut up. Shut up. Two out of three.

146
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,660
God!

147
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,447
Bundle up out there, all right?

148
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,037
Um, do you want to sit on the
couch? No. No, no, I'm okay.

149
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,797
It's more comfortable. Uh, I'm fine.

150
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,967
You know, I think I
will sit on the couch.

151
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,107
Let me guess.

152
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,095
You're sitting on her couch trying
to think of something to say.

153
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,823
Did you find kurt? He
hasn't been at work all week,

154
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:52,029
But because I'm good, and
I mean really, really good,

155
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,847
I got a line on where he might be.

156
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,467
What's she wearing? Bye, dean.

157
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,237
Oh, sammy.

158
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,717
Who died and made you sheriff?
I will call who I want.

159
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,457
Whatever you want. Look what time it is.

160
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,347
You're gonna wake her up and start talking about
- I saw that.

161
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,217
What? Saw what?

162
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,793
Okay, this
is the deal --

163
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:31,097
My house, my tv.

164
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,254
I never get to watch my show,

165
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:35,092
So suck it up.

166
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,462
Wait, so

167
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:52,691
So kindall married ethan's
father just to get back at him?

168
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,227
And now she's set to inherit all the
casinos that were supposed to go to ethan.

169
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,597
What a bitch!

170
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,957
Admit it -You're hooked.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

171
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,467
I wouldn't say I'm hooked.

172
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,407
Can I ask you a question?

173
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,617
It's ... it's a little personal.

174
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,917
You've seen my entire
underwear collection.

175
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,217
Go ahead.

176
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,997
Okay, um...

177
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,627
Well, you're -You're clearly smart.

178
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,557
I mean, your house is full
of great books, you know?

179
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,957
And you're independent. Uh-Huh.

180
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,987
What were you doing with kurt?

181
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,367
I don't know.

182
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,281
I mean, it's not like he
introduced himself, like,

183
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:44,050
Hi, I'm possessive and controlling,
and I like to punch people.

184
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:46,826
Want to be my girlfriend?

185
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,065
Yeah, well,

186
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,841
I guess we all make mistakes.

187
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,527
Yeah, well, mine's wanted by the police.

188
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,257
You want to know why I
stayed with him? Really?

189
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,917
I was too insecure to leave.

190
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,267
Well, I find that hard to believe.
You don't really seem like the type.

191
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,427
Yeah, well some stuff happened.

192
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,397
My life changed, I changed,
for the better, I think.

193
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,717
What happened? Well, for
one thing, I got mugged.

194
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,637
And that's supposed to be a good thing?

195
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,342
I know, it sounds strange,

196
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:17,802
And don't get me
wrong -It rattled me --

197
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:20,031
But then it hit me.

198
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:25,087
I could keep feeling sorry for myself
or I could take control of my life.

199
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,197
I chose the latter.

200
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,767
First thing I did was
tell kurt he had to go.

201
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,047
Smart move. Apparently.

202
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,027
Everything else just
opened up, blossomed.

203
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,187
It's all been wonderful, really.

204
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,347
What?

205
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,341
Doesn't everybody think that being
a victim of random violence is

206
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,465
The best thing that
ever happened to them?

207
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,547
Yeah, not so much.

208
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,867
You're...

209
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,597
Unusual.

210
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,237
Unusual like...

211
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,157
"Unusual"? No, no, no.

212
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,087
Unusual like...

213
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,687
Impressive.

214
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,797
You think so?

215
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,127
Sorry.

216
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,346
Hey. I found him.

217
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,657
Good. Don't take your eyes off him.

218
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,217
Oh, yeah, my eyes are glued.

219
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,197
Look, sammy, I got to let you go.

220
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,807
I, uh, I don't want to miss anything.

221
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,777
So, um...

222
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,887
I'm gonna turn in.

223
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,847
Okay, yeah.

224
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,107
Well, I'll be here. Okay.

225
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,247
If you hear anything, if you
wake up, just -Just call out.

226
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,767
Okay. Okay.

227
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,807
Dean, you okay? Yeah,
now that I'm conscious.

228
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,667
The werewolf knocked me out.

229
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,157
Sam, it's madison.

230
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,247
What? !

231
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,797
Yeah, awesome job of
keeping an eye on her.

232
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,037
Dean, I've been here the whole
time. She's in bed asleep.

233
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,357
Well, she wasn't an hour ago.

234
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,947
Check her right arm. I nicked
her with a silver knife.

235
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,707
Morning.

236
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,567
Um, wherare my pajamas?

237
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,097
Sam?

238
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,117
What's going on?

239
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,237
Where are you going?

240
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,257
I'm not going anywhere.

241
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,707
And neither are you.

242
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,607
You're psychotic.

243
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,517
The whole "I'm a cop"
trick. God, I am so stupid.

244
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,847
Well, I guess neither of us
are who we said we were, huh?

245
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,307
Sam, you're sick, okay?

246
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,707
You're imagining things.

247
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,237
Monsters don't exist. Not really.

248
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,607
You know what? Save the act.

249
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,547
It's not an act!

250
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,177
I am not a werewolf!
There is no such thing!

251
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,587
It's made up, all right?

252
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,797
They're not real! You
know they're not real!

253
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,657
No? Then where did that come from?

254
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,027
I don't know!

255
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,057
Sam, god, you need help.

256
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,107
Please, don't do something
that you're gonna regret.

257
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,797
I'm not what you think I am.

258
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,517
I'm not.

259
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,447
How you doing?

260
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,087
My head feels great, thanks.

261
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,507
We got to talk.

262
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,537
She says she has no idea
what I'm talking about.

263
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,687
She's lying.

264
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,793
Maybe. Or maybe she really
doesn't know she's changing.

265
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:48,727
Maybe when the creature
takes over, she blacks out.

266
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,617
Like a really hot incredible hulk?

267
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,937
Dude, she ganked her boss and her ex-Boyfriend.
That doesn't sound ration unconscious.

268
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,487
But what if it was, dean?

269
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,907
What if some animal part of her
brain saw both those guys as threats?

270
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,327
Hell, the cop, too. Are
you the dog whisperer now?

271
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,157
Look, man, I just...

272
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,549
I don't know. There was
something in her eyes.

273
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:07,584
Yeah, she's killing people.

274
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:10,160
But if she has no control..
Exactly she can't control it.

275
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:12,156
Even if she's telling the truth,
it's not gonna change anything.

276
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,575
I'm not putting a bullet through some
girl who has no idea what's happening.

277
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,145
Sam she is master You're
feeling sorry for her?

278
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:18,007
Maybe I understand her.

279
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,567
Look, there might be another way we can get
the job done without having to waste her.

280
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,797
Are you thinking what
I think you're thinking?

281
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,767
Dad's theory.

282
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,047
Lycanthropy might have a cure if you kill the
werewolf who bit you, severing the bloodline.

283
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,067
Might have a cure. Meaning who knows?

284
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,367
It's worth a shot.  We don't
even know where to look.

285
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,267
The puppy that bit her -- It could be
anyone, anywhere. Could have been years ago.

286
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,447
No, I don't think so.

287
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,347
Madison...

288
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,597
When were you mugged?

289
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,207
Please, it's important, all right?

290
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,647
Just answer the question.

291
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,567
About a month ago.

292
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,397
Did you see the guy? No.

293
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,747
He grabbed me from behind.

294
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,327
Did he bite you?

295
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,377
How did you know that?

296
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,787
Where?

297
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,897
O-On the back of my neck.

298
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,477
Oh, that's just a love bite.

299
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,977
Believe me, that could
have been a lot worse.

300
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,817
Where were you at the time?
Walking home from a friend's loft.

301
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,757
Let me guess.

302
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,477
Not too far from hunter's point?

303
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,227
Same place where those
other murders happened.

304
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,677
I'm telling you, it's the
werewolf's hunting grounds.

305
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,117
But that doesn't mean it's
gonna be out there tonight.

306
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,827
It's the right time of the lunar cycle.

307
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,647
I know it's a long shot.

308
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,737
You're forgetting something.

309
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,077
Maddie's probably gonna turn soon.

310
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,557
We can't let her take off
to an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.

311
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,727
I'll stay with her.

312
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,327
And if she busts loose?

313
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,681
Sam? I'll do it.

314
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,717
Sam. I'll shoot her, all right?

315
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,697
But, dean, I need you to go out there.

316
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,177
At least go look for the thing.

317
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,377
Dean, please.

318
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,137
We can save this girl.

319
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,197
Fine.

320
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,987
Please.

321
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,307
Just let me go.

322
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,327
Look...

323
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,117
I know you're scared.

324
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,377
I also know that there's no way
in hell you're gonna believe me.

325
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,517
But I'm doing this...

326
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,957
Because I'm trying to help you.

327
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,270
I'm not gonna lie, all right?

328
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,757
The odds aren't exactly in our favor.

329
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,467
But if this goes the
way I pray it does...

330
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,535
I'll untie you,

331
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:41,067
And I'll walk out that door,
and I'll never come back.

332
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,607
You'll live the rest of your life...

333
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,247
And I'll just be a bad memory.

334
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,657
Hey!

335
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,447
It happened...

336
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,127
Again.

337
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,527
Where am I?

338
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,507
H-Help me.

339
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,667
God. Oh, my god.

340
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,637
Easy gelen just take it easy

341
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,407
It should be over now.

342
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,347
You'll never see me again.

343
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,197
It was sort of sad, actually.

344
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,857
Glenn had no clue what was going on.

345
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,497
Why do you think he turned Madison
instead of just killing her?

346
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,807
I don't know.

347
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,017
He kind of seemed to
have a thing for her.

348
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,487
Maybe his primal instinct did, too.

349
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,077
Maybe he was looking for a
little hot breeding action.

350
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,787
Yeah. Something like that.

351
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,977
So?

352
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,117
So what?

353
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,797
Speaking of madison... oh, whatever.

354
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,757
You liked her. Maybe, uh
- Dean.

355
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,832
She thought I was a
stark-Raving lunatic.

356
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:39,593
You saved her life.

357
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:41,547
But she doesn't know that.

358
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,137
You know, for a stakeout,
your car's a bit conspicous.

359
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:47,637
What are you still doing here?

360
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,687
Honestly? Uh...

361
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,433
We're pretty sure you're
not gonna turn tonight,

362
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:54,859
But we got to be 100%,

363
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:57,457
So, you know, we're... lurking.

364
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,137
Look, I know this sounds crazy
- It sure does.

365
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,187
Well, if we're gonna wait it out...

366
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,697
We might as well do it together.

367
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,737
You were telling the truth, weren't you?

368
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,907
About everything.

369
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,997
What you did -It was to help me.

370
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,867
Yeah.

371
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,317
I did all those horrible things...

372
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,527
When I turned.

373
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,757
You didn't know.

374
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,857
So when will we know for sure?

375
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,817
Moonrise?  No, I don't think so.

376
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,027
You turned middle of
the night last night.

377
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,337
I think we got to hang in until sunup.

378
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,877
Well, looks like we got
ourselves a few hours to kill.

379
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,837
Poker, anyone?

380
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,027
Oh, no, you guys talk.

381
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,567
Does -Does this mean it worked?

382
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,267
Yeah, I think so.

383
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,527
Oh, god, thank you.

384
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,407
Thank you so much.

385
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,227
You too, Dean.

386
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,617
Thank you.

387
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,527
Ah, don't mention it.

388
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:22,667
So, I'm just gonna head back to the hotel
and watch some pay-Per-View or something.

389
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,897
That was smooth.

390
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,727
He means well.

391
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,177
He means he thinks
you're gonna get laid.

392
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,567
Look, I --
It's okay.

393
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,727
No.

394
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,087
I know I scared the crap
out of you, all right?

395
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,837
I -I mean, I tied you to a chair.

396
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,837
That's right up there with
me scratching up your face.

397
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,587
There's just no way...

398
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,427
We could go back, you know?

399
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,537
To before it happened.

400
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,757
You're right.

401
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,027
There's just no way.

402
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,917
She -She turned.

403
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,907
What?

404
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,087
I couldn't grab her in time.

405
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,037
We'll find her, sammy.

406
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,657
I already called bobby.

407
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,267
He doesn't know anything, except he knew
severing the bloodline wouldn't work.

408
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,687
They all say it's
impossible to reverse it.

409
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,807
How come she didn't turn
when we were with her?

410
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,498
You put her to bed and
then she wolfed out.

411
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:20,817
Maybe she's got to be asleep to turn.

412
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,177
What the hell does it matter?

413
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,767
We got to find some way to
help her, some legend we missed.

414
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,537
Don't you think someone
we know would have known?

415
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,247
Then we have to look harder
until we find something.

416
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,497
Sammy, I don't think we
got a choice here anymore.

417
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,697
What?

418
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,107
She's a sweet girl, but part of her is
- Evil?

419
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,737
Yeah.

420
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,567
That's what they say about me, dean.

421
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,007
So me you won't kill, but her
you're just gonna blow away?

422
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,757
Sam?

423
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,207
Madison, where are you?

424
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,787
I don't -I don't -I
don't know where I am.

425
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,817
Do you see any street signs?

426
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,027
Um... yeah, yeah.

427
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,517
Middle point.

428
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,407
Hold on, maddie.

429
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,597
We're coming to get you.
Just stay where you are.

430
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,837
I don't remember anything.

431
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,347
I probably killed someone last night.

432
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,877
Didn't I?

433
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,567
There's no way to know yet.

434
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,407
Is there something else we
can try to make it go away?

435
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,637
We'll find something.

436
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,657
There's got to be
some answer -Somewhere.

437
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,387
That's not entirely true.

438
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,387
Madison, you deserve to know.

439
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,757
We've scoured every source.

440
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,227
There's just no cure.

441
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,237
Is -Is he right?

442
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,567
Well, we could lock
you up at night, but...

443
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,087
You bust out, and some night you will...

444
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,947
Someone else dies.

445
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,987
I'm sorry. I am.

446
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,337
So I guess that's all
there is to it, then.

447
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,357
Stop it. Don't talk like that.

448
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,567
Sam, I don't want to hurt anyone else.

449
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,617
I don't want to hurt you.

450
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,527
Put that down.

451
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,857
I can't do it myself.

452
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,787
I need you to help me.  Madison, no.

453
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,797
Sam.

454
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,037
I'm a monster. You don't have to be.

455
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,367
We could find a way, all right?

456
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,367
I can. I'm gonna save you.

457
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,957
You tried.

458
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,817
I know you tried.

459
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,797
This is all there is left.

460
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,957
Help me, sam.

461
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,287
I want you to do it.

462
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,717
I want it to be you. I can't.

463
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,987
I don't want to die.

464
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,747
I don't.

465
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,937
But I can't live like this.

466
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,697
This is the way you can save me.

467
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,487
Please.

468
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,947
I'm asking you to save me.

469
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,527
Sam

470
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,287
I'm sorry.

471
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,867
No, you're right.

472
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,407
She's right.

473
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,467
Sammy, I got this one. I'll do it.

474
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,487
She asked me to.

475
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,517
You don't have to. Yes, I do.

476
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,387
Please.

477
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,967
Just wait here.
