1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,170
Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,800
To free lucifer from hell.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,140
- Who are you - castiel.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,210
I'm an angel of the lord.

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,740
Anna,you all right

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,240
I remember now who i am.

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,940
I'm an angel.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,120
You can't run...dean.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,290
Alastair.

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,790
This is uriel,a specialist.

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,920
Pamela barnes,best damn psychic in the state.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,260
Pamela!

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,630
He took me off the rack,and i tortured souls,

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,100
And i liked it.

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,170
No matter how many people i save,

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,140
I can't fill this hole.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,910
It's not the psychic thing i got a problem with.

18
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,040
Yeah,i know what you got a problem with,

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,310
But tough.

20
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,240
-  -
It's the only way. no.

21
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,780
I know what you did to that demon,sam.

22
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,920
!
Pamela!

23
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,270
Goodbye,sister.

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
What the hell

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,660
Ruby will meet us outside cheyenne.

26
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,800
She's been tracking some leads.

27
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,030
Look,i know she's not exactly on your christmas list,

28
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,640
But if she can help us get to lilith --

29
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,010
Man,work with ruby,don't. i don't really give a rat's ass.

30
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,340
What's your problem

31
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,340
Pamela didn't want anything to do with this,

32
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,610
And we dragged her back into it,sam.

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,150
She knew what was at stake.

34
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,510
Oh,yeah,saving the world.

35
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,750
And we're doing such a damn good job of it.

36
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,850
Dean --

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,220
I'm tired of burying friends,sam.

38
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,090
Look,if we catch a fresh trail --

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,190
We follow it. i know.

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,230
Like i said,i'm just -- i'm just getting tired.

41
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,960
Well,get angry.

42
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,470
""
Home,crappy home.

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,810
Winchester and winchester.

44
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,310
Oh,come on!

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,580
You are needed.

46
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,950
Needed

47
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,680
We just got back from needed!

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,580
Now,you mind your tone with me.

49
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,390
No,you mind your damn tone with us.

50
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,020
We just got back from pamela's funeral.

51
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,190
Pamela -- you know,psychic pamela

52
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,530
You remember her.

53
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,860
Cass,you remember her. you burned her eyes out.

54
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,030
Remember that good times!

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,370
Yeah,then she died saving one of your precious seals.

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,870
So,maybe you can stop pushing us around like chess pieces

57
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,740
For five freakin' minutes!

58
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,680
We raised you out of hell for our purposes.

59
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,610
Yeah,and what were those again

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,380
What exactly do you want from me

61
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,180
Start with gratitude.

62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,820
Dean,we know this is difficult to understand.

63
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,590
...
And we...

64
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,960
...don't...care.

65
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,870
All of them from our garrison.

66
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,800
The last one was killed tonight.

67
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,700
Demons

68
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,940
How they doing it

69
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,440
We don't know.

70
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,210
I'm sorry,but what do you want us to do about it

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,040
I mean,a demon with the juice to ice angels

72
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,750
Has to be out of our league,right

73
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,910
We can handle the demons,thank you very much.

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,720
Once we find whoever it is.

75
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,020
...
So,you need our help...

76
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,790
Hunting a demon

77
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,060
Not quite.

78
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,760
We have alastair. great.

79
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,970
He should be able to name your triggerman.

80
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,630
But he won't talk.

81
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,940
Alastair's will is very strong.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,040
We've arrived at an impasse.

83
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,040
Yeah,well,he's like a black belt in torture.

84
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,810
I mean,you guys are out of your league.

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,140
That's why we've come to his student.

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,040
You happen to be

87
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,080
the most qualified interrogator we've got.

88
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,850
Dean...

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,720
You're our best hope.

90
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,760
No.

91
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,090
No way.

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,660
You can't ask me to do this,cass -- not this.

93
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,870
...
Who said anything...

94
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,410
about asking

95
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,250
Damn it!

96
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,890
This devil's trap is old enochian.

97
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,620
He's bound completely.

98
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,970
Fascinating.

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,370
Where's the door

100
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,710
Where are you going

101
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,440
Hitch back to Cheyenne,thank you very much.

102
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,680
Angels are dying,boy.

103
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,080
Everybody's dying these days.

104
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,550
You can make me do whatever you want,

105
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,400
but you can't make me do this.

106
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,260
This is too much to ask. I know.

107
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,510
But we have to ask it.

108
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,880
I want to talk to Cass alone.

109
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,220
I think I'll go seek...

110
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,520
revelation.

111
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,400
We might have some further orders.

112
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,640
Well,get some doughnuts while you're out.

113
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,750
Ah,this one just won't quit,will he

114
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,750
I think I'm starting to like you,boy.

115
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
You guys don't walk enough. You're gonna get flabby.

116
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,530
You know,I'm starting to think

117
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,930
Junkless has a better sense of humor than you do.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,830
Uriel's the funniest angel in the garrison.

119
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,030
Ask anyone.

120
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,210
What's going on,cass

121
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,810
Since when does Uriel put a leash on you

122
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,210
My superiors have begun to question my sympathies.

123
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,640
Your sympathies

124
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,980
I was getting too close to the humans in my charge.

125
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,600
You.

126
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,130
They feel I've begun to express emotions,

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,170
the doorways to doubt.

128
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,740
This can impair my judgment.

129
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,340
...
Well,tell Uriel or whoever...

130
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,310
...you do not want me doing this,trust me.

131
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,680
Want it No.

132
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,450
But I've been told we need it.

133
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,690
...
You ask me to open that door and walk through it...

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,660
you will not like what walks back out.

135
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,000
...
For what it's worth...

136
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,860
I would give anything

137
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,870
not to have you do this.

138
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,490
Heaven.

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,720
I'm in heaven

140
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:48,930
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,670
I seem to find the happiness I seek

142
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,840
When we're out together dancing

143
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,910
Cheek to cheek.

144
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,250
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,450
I --

146
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,990
This is a very serious,very emotional situation for you.

147
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,760
I shouldn't laugh.

148
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,600
It's just that,I mean,are they serious

149
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,170
They sent you to torture me

150
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,640
You got one chance.

151
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,040
One.

152
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,510
Tell me who is killing the angels.

153
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,380
I want a name.

154
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,380
You think I'll see all your scary toys

155
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,450
and spill my guts

156
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,560
Oh,you'll spill your guts,one way or another.

157
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,460
I just didn't want to ruin my shoes.

158
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,660
...
Well...

159
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,230
Now answer the question.

160
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,500
Or what you'll work me over

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,900
...
But then,maybe...

162
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,640
You don't want to.

163
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,240
...
Maybe...

164
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,010
you're a-scared to

165
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,950
I'm here,aren't I

166
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,180
Not entirely.

167
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,450
You left part of yourself back in the pit.

168
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Let's see if we can...

169
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,160
Get the two of you back together again,shall we

170
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,960
You're gonna be disappointed.

171
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,030
You have not disappointed me so far.

172
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,540
Come on.

173
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,970
You got to want a little payback

174
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,640
For everything I did to you

175
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,910
For all the pokes and prods.

176
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,550
No

177
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,190
Then...

178
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,520
How about for all the things I did to your daddy

179
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,500
I can still smell them.

180
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,570
Seriously,Sam,I'm not exactly dying

181
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,270
to tangle with angels again.

182
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,740
I need you to find out where they took dean.

183
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,540
Not sure I see the problem.

184
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,730
You know they have Alastair

185
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,740
strung up six ways from sunday.

186
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,280
Dean cuts himself a slice,

187
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,650
Al's reduced to a quivering heap,

188
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,780
And the good guys get the goods.

189
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,880
What's wrong with that

190
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,490
He can't do it.

191
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,790
Look,I get it.

192
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,920
You don't want him going all torture master again.

193
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,690
No,I mean,he can't do it.

194
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,790
He can't get the job done.

195
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,000
Something happened to him downstairs,Ruby.

196
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,930
He's not what he used to be. he's not strong enough.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,670
And you are

198
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,000
I will be.

199
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,370
Had your pop on my rack for close to a century.

200
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,140
Can't stall forever.

201
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,780

John Winchester -- made quite a name for himself.

202
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,250
A hundred years.

203
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,350
And after each session,

204
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,750
I'd make him the same offer I made you.

205
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,260
I'd put down my blade if he picked one up.

206
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,460
Just give me the demon's name,Alastair.

207
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,130
But...

208
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,590
He said,"nein"...

209
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,500
...each and every time.

210
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,370
Damned if I couldn't break him.

211
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
Pulled out all the stops.

212
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,180
But John,he was... made of something unique.

213
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,010
The stuff of heroes.

214
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,810
And then came Dean.

215
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,220

Mmm,Dean Winchester.

216
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,220
I thought I was up against it again.

217
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,920
But daddy's little girl --

218
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,530
He broked.

219
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,030
He broked in 30.

220
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,870
Just not the man your daddy wanted you to be,huh,Dean

221
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,410
Now...

222
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,350
Now we're getting somewhere.

223
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,850
Holy water

224
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,780
Come on!

225
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,200
Grasshopper,you're gonna have

226
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,190
to get creative to impress me.

227
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,760
You know something,Alastair

228
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,090
I could still dream,even in hell.

229
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,500
And over and over and over,you know what I dreamt

230
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,330
I dreamt of this moment.

231
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,500
And believe me...

232
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,540
...I got a few ideas.

233
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's get started.

234
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,630
Let me know if you want some more.

235
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,870
There's plenty left.

236
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,180
Go directly to hell.

237
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,810
Do not pass go. do not collect $200.

238
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,080
Mihi pareas.

239
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,250
Ubicumque in occultatione sis,

240
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,220
Defigo te ut mihi pareas.

241
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,590
Igni...fiat...

242
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,330
Notum.

243
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,630
Relax. The fire is our friend.

244
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,830
Besides,the only part of the map we need

245
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,070
""
is the "where's dean" part.

246
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,900
Out.

247
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,980
There. your brother is there.

248
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,480
And it's a good thing angels aren't concerned

249
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,720
with hiding their dirty business.

250
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,080
Not used to being spied on.

251
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,620
I mean,who'd be stupid enough to try

252
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,620
Ruby,it's been weeks.

253
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,290
I need it.

254
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,290
You don't seem too happy about it.

255
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,730
You think i want to do this

256
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,630
This is the last thing i --

257
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,370
But i need to be strong enough.

258
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,080
It's okay.

259
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,880
It's okay,Sammy.

260
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,580
You can have it.

261
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,080
It's okay,sam.

262
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,890
There's that little pig poker.

263
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,690
I wondered where it went.

264
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,170
Do you really think this is gonna fix you

265
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,970
Give you closure

266
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,810
Oh,that is sad.

267
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,840
That's really sad.

268
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,210
Sad,sad.

269
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:01,070
I...carved you into a n-new animal,Dean.

270
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,500
There is no...going back.

271
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,570
Maybe you're right.

272
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,850
But now it's my turn to carve.

273
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,590
Who's behind the murders

274
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,660
I want the demon's name.

275
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,840
Anna.

276
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,170
Hello,Castiel.

277
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,910
Your human body.

278
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,220
It was destroyed. i know.

279
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,720
But...

280
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,550
I guess i'm sentimental.

281
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,790
Called in some old favors,and...

282
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,930
You shouldn't be here.

283
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,130
We still have orders to kill you.

284
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,130
Somehow,i don't think you'll try.

285
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,400
Where's Uriel

286
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,810
He went to receive revelation.

287
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,340
Right.

288
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,930
Well,it's your professionalism that i respect.

289
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,740
Why are you letting Dean do this

290
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,280
He's doing god's work.

291
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,050
Torturing

292
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,590
That's god's work

293
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,660
Stop him,Cass,please.

294
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,290
Before you ruin the one real weapon you have.

295
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,560
Who are we to question the will of god

296
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,530
Unless... this isn't his will.

297
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,230
Then where do the orders come from

298
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,570
I don't know. one of our superiors maybe.

299
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,170
But not him.

300
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,540
Who's murdering the angels

301
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,450
The father you love...

302
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,620
You think he wants this

303
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,720
You think he'd ask this of you

304
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,620
You think this is righteous

305
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,260
What you're feeling...

306
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,970
It's called doubt.

307
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,480
These orders are wrong,

308
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,820
And you know it.

309
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,680
But you can do the right thing.

310
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,050
You're afraid,Cass.

311
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,320
I was,too.

312
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,130
But together,we can --

313
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,460
Together

314
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,400
I am nothing like you.

315
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,170
You fell.

316
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,700
Go.

317
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,570
Cass.

318
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,180
Go.

319
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,890
Just not getting deep enough.

320
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,800
Well,you lack the resources.

321
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,030
Reality is just...

322
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,830
I don't know.

323
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,540
...too concrete up here.

324
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,010
Honestly,Dean...

325
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,350
You have no idea how bad it really was...

326
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,450
And what you really did for us.

327
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,790
Shut up.

328
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,790
The whole bloody thing,Dean.

329
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,790
The reason Lilith wanted you there in the first place.

330
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,630
Okay,then i'll just make you shut up.

331
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,820
S-sorry.

332
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,260
Something caught in my throat.

333
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,660
I think it's my throat.

334
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,060
Well,strap in.

335
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,030
'cause i'm just starting to have fun.

336
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,540
It was supposed to be your father.

337
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,380
He was supposed to bring it on.

338
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,850
But in the end,it was you.

339
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,650
Bring what on

340
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,980
Every night,the same offer,remember

341
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,320
Same as your father.

342
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,030
And finally you said,"sign me up."

343
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,700
Oh,the first time you picked up my razor,

344
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,400
The first time

345
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:42,970
You sliced into that weeping bitch...

346
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,580
That was the first seal.

347
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,750
You're lying.

348
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,030
"and it is written that the first seal shall be broken

349
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,770
"when a righteous man sheds blood in hell.

350
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,510
As he breaks,so shall it break."

351
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,320
We had to break the first seal before any others.

352
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,320
Only way to get the dominoes to fall right.

353
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,760
Topple the one at the front of the line.

354
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,200
When we win...

355
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,370
When we bring on the apocalypse

356
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,670
And burn this earth down...

357
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,310
We'll owe it all to you...

358
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,280

Dean winchester.

359
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,820
Believe me,son.

360
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:11,060
I wouldn't lie about this.

361
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,230
It's kind of a...

362
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,570
...religious sort of thing with me.

363
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,950
No.

364
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,120
I don't think you are lying.

365
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,860
But even if the demons do win...

366
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,000
...you won't be there to see it.

367
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,570
You should talk to your plumber about the pipes.

368
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,040
You've got a lot to learn,boy,

369
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,040
So I'll see you back in class,

370
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,010
Bright and early,monday morning.

371
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,150
Oh,almost.

372
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,820
Looks like god is on my side today.

373
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,250
You know...

374
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,920
Like roaches,you celestials.

375
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,460
I really wish I knew how to kill you.

376
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,630
But all I can do is send you back to heaven.

377
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,170
Omnipotentis dei potestateminvoco.

378
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,670
Omnipotentis dei potestateminvoco.

379
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,410
Omnipotentis dei potestateminvoco.

380
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,470
Stupid pet tricks.

381
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,270
Who's murdering the angels

382
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,500
How are they doing it

383
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,170
You think i'm gonna tell you

384
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,400
Yeah,I do.

385
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,910
How are the demons killing angels!

386
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,080
I...

387
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,380
Don't...know!

388
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,150
Right.

389
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,890
It's...not...us!

390
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,390
We're...not doing it!

391
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,090
I don't believe you.

392
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,600
Lilith... is not behind this.

393
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:41,970
She wouldn't kill seven angels.

394
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,270
She'd kill 100...

395
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,110
1,000.

396
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,090
Oh,go ahead.

397
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,790
Send me back...

398
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,790
If you can.

399
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,730
I'm stronger than that now.

400
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,830
Now I can kill.

401
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,530
-  -
- Sam. -get in there and heal him.

402
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,300
-    -
- Miracle now. - I can't.

403
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,070
-  -
- You and Uriel put him in there! - no.

404
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,370
Because you can't keep a simple devil's trap together.

405
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,740
I don't know what happened. that trap --

406
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,010
It shouldn't have broken. I am sorry.

407
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,710
This whole thing was pointless.

408
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,680
You understand that

409
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,250
The demons aren't doing the hits.

410
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,350
Something else is killing your soldiers.

411
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,050
Perhaps Alastair was lying.

412
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,620
No.

413
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,520
He wasn't.

414
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,710
Castiel

415
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,180
I received revelation from our superiors.

416
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,850
Our brothers and sisters are dying,and they --

417
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,450
They want us to stop hunting the demon responsible.

418
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,060
Something is wrong up there.

419
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,200
I mean,can you feel it

420
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,070
The murderers -- maybe they aren't demonic.

421
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,850

Sam winchester said

422
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,570
the demons have nothing to do with it.

423
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,040
If not the demons,what could it be

424
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,480
The will of heaven.

425
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,750
We are failing,uriel.

426
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,090
We are losing the war.

427
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,390
Perhaps the garrison is being punished.

428
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,920
You think our father would --

429
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,990
I think maybe our father isn't giving the orders anymore.

430
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,000
Maybe there is something wrong.

431
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,500
Well,i won't wait to be gutted.

432
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,280
Anna.

433
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,490
Anna,please.

434
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,270
Decided to kill me after all

435
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,400
I'm alone.

436
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,270
What do you want from me,castiel

437
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,570
I'm considering disobedience.

438
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,010
Good.

439
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,980
No. it isn't.

440
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,080
For the first time...

441
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,650
I feel.

442
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,450
It gets worse.

443
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,860
Choosing your own course of action --

444
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,530
It's confusing...

445
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,490
It's terrifying.

446
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,900
That's right.

447
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,740
You're too good for my help.

448
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,710
I'm just trash...

449
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,070
A walking blasphemy.

450
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,010
Anna...

451
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,880
I don't know what to do.

452
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,780
Please tell me what to do.

453
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,050
Like the old days

454
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,520
No.

455
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,120
I'm sorry.

456
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,060
It's time to think for yourself.

457
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,440
You called

458
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,650
What do you say,castiel

459
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,380
Will you join me

460
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,980
Will you fight with me

461
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,390
It's strange...

462
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,020
Strange how...

463
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,620
A leaky pipe

464
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,990
Can undo the work of angels

465
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,000
When we ourselves...

466
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,800
Are supppped to be the agents of fate.

467
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,730
Alastair was much more powerful than we had imagined.

468
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,870
No.

469
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,070
No demon can overpower that trap.

470
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,840
I made it myself.

471
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,810
We've been friends for a long time,uriel.

472
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,010
Fought by each others' sides,

473
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,280
Served together away from home...

474
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,890
...for what seems like...

475
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,060
Forever.

476
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,330
We're brothers,uriel.

477
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,260
Pay me that respect. tell me the truth.

478
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,830
The truth is...

479
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,600
The only thing that can kill an angel...

480
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,470
...is another angel.

481
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,700
You.

482
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,970
I'm afraid so.

483
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,010
And you broke the devil's trap,

484
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,180
Set alastair on dean.

485
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,850
Alastair should never have been taken aliv

486
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,220
Really inconvenient,cass.

487
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,920
Yes,i did turn the screw a little.

488
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:53,460
Alastair should' killed deanand,

489
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,860
For the murders of our kin

490
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,760
Not murders,castiel.

491
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,770
No.

492
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,540
My work...is conversion.

493
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
How long have we waited here

494
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,670
How long have we played this game

495
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,910
By rules that make no sense

496
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,940
It is our father's world,uriel.

497
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,450
Our father

498
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,020
He stopped being that,if he ever was,

499
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,980
The moment he created them.

500
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,790
Humanity.

501
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,660
His favorites.

502
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,060
His whining,puking larvae.

503
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,930
Are you trying to convert me

504
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,860
I wanted you to join me,and i still do.

505
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,970
With you,we can be powerful enough to --

506
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,070
to

507
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,600
to raise our brother.

508
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,470
lucifer.

509
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,310
you do remember him.

510
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,580
how strong he was...

511
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,280
how beautiful.

512
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,950
and he didn't bow to humanity.

513
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,590
he was punished for defending us.

514
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,720
now,if you want to believe in something,cass,

515
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,890
believe in him.

516
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,890
Lucifer is not god.

517
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,060
god isn't god anymore.

518
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,170
he doesn't care what we do.

519
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,530
i am proof of that.

520
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,940
but this

521
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,240
what were you gonna do,uriel

522
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,550
were you gonna kill the whole garrison

523
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,810
i only killed the ones who said no.

524
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,320
others have joined me,cass.

525
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,420
now,please,brother. don't fight me.

526
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,060
help me.

527
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,930
help me spread the word.

528
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,170
help me bring on this apocalypse.

529
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,240
all you have to do...

530
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,940
is be unafraid.

531
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,920
for the first time in a long time...

532
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,790
...i am.

533
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,190
you can't win,uriel.

534
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,230
i still serve god.

535
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,430
you haven't even met the man!

536
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,930
there is no will!

537
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,570
no wrath!

538
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,310
no...god.

539
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,050
maybe or maybe not.

540
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,490
but there's still me.

541
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
are you all right

542
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,600
no thanks to you.

543
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,940
you need to be more careful.

544
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,950
you need to learn how to manage a damn devil's trap.

545
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,580
that's not what i mean.

546
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,590
uriel is dead.

547
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,960
was it the demons

548
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,760
it was disobedience.

549
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,030
he was working against us.

550
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,800
is it true

551
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,510
did i break the first seal

552
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,880
did i start all this

553
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,280
yes.

554
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,820
when we discovered lilith's plan for you...

555
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,430
...we laid siege to hell,

556
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,560
and we fought our way to get to you before you --

557
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,400
jump-started the apocalypse.

558
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,740
but we were too late.

559
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,170
why didn't you just leave me there,then

560
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,910
it's not...blame that falls on you,dean.

561
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,880
it's fate.

562
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:19,260
(,)
and the righteous man who begins it

563
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,990
is the only one who can finish it.

564
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,030
you have to stop it.

565
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,740
lucifer

566
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,040
the apocalypse

567
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,210
what does that mean

568
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,020
don't you go disappearing on me,you son of a bitch.

569
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,190
what does that mean

570
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,390
i don't know.

571
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,290
bull!

572
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,390
i don't.

573
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,870
dean,they don't tell me much.

574
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,330
i know...

575
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,200
how our fate rests with you.

576
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,780
well,then,you guys are screwed.

577
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,150
i can't do it,cass.

578
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,380
it's too big.

579
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,150
alastair was right.

580
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,350
i'm not all here.

581
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,750
i'm not -- i'm not strong enough.

582
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,860
well,i guess i'm not the man

583
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,970
either of our dads wanted me to be.

584
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,540
find someone else.

585
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,680
it's not me.
