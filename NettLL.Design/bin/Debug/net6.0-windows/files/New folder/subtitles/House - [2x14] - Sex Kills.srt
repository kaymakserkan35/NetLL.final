1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,295
Two spades.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,380
Three hearts.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,966
It's all yours.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,427
I fold.

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,138
And that's five.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,807
- And that's six.
- Yay!

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:16,975
Not bad.

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,021
On a slam contract, you normally
want to play your winners early.

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:21,939
Sorry, Dad.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,358
Nah. You're learning.
You're doing fine.

11
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,444
Woman:
Connie Gilman's a good player.
And a widow.

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,907
I should, uh, take her out
because she can play bridge.

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,368
You're a true romantic.

14
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,996
Woman 2:
You should ask somebody out.
You think Cecile's not dating yet?

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,083
- Cecile was dating before she left.
- Oh, shut up, Marv.

16
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,169
No. I have a partner.
And she's doing great.

17
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,380
Amy should be out having fun.

18
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,383
I'm having fun.

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,634
Yeah.

20
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,929
Look like you're having
the time of your life.

21
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,982
- One no trump.
- (Woman, laughing) Ooh!

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,361
I'm just...a little nauseous.
I, uh, I think I ate too much.

23
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,738
- Can we take a break?
- Of course.

24
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,490
Excuse us.

25
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,035
What did you eat?

26
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,245
Nothing weird.

27
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,831
- Have you been drinking?
- No, Dad. You know I don't--

28
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,041
Because I don't mind if you--

29
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,501
Dad?

30
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,630
[Echoing] Dad?

31
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,383
Dad, what are you doing?

32
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,473
You're scaring me.
It hurts. Let go!

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,517
What are you doing?

34
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,603
Man:
Henry?

35
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,440
Henry.
Let go of her.

36
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,820
The occasional drink
doesn't bother me. But...

37
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,323
What?

38
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,449
Are you okay?

39
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,492
What's the matter?

40
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:08,045
2X14 - Sex Kills

41
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,028
Original Airdate (FOX):  7 March-2006

42
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,078
You had what's called
an "absence seizure."

43
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,121
Anything like that
happen to you before?

44
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,373
No, Nothing.

45
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:47,626
He's been really healthy.
He jogs, he eats right. He--

46
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,671
I--well, I did have
a headache last Sunday.

47
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,633
And for the past two years,
I've been getting acid reflux a lot.

48
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,220
And I thought that, uh,
antacids were all I needed.

49
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,888
Should I have come in sooner?

50
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,932
For acid reflux and a headache?

51
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:11,275
Well, I--you know,
I hear the coffee downstairs
is really good.

52
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,443
Could you get me a cup, Honey?

53
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,158
Would you mind
closing the blinds?

54
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,249
Foreman:
His right testicle is almost
twice as big as his left.

55
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,250
Cool.

56
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,294
It's probably testicular cancer.

57
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,588
Mmm, no.
That's impossible.

58
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:36,383
- The symptoms all indicate--
- The shoes aren't right.

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,430
Here's how testicular cancer
would manifest itself.

60
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,308
First, the patient would get
the exact symptoms that he's got.

61
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,101
Then Foreman would examine him.

62
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:50,564
Then he'd suspect
testicular cancer on account of
the symptoms being so perfect.

63
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,317
Then he'd stick a needle in it.
Then he'd call a surgeon.

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,613
And while that guy operates,
the rest of us would be out bowling.

65
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,699
And since we're not
wearing bowling shoes,

66
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,076
the disease obviously
did not progress in that fashion.

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,038
LP showed some white cells.
But his MRI is clean.

68
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,833
Sure. If you call a microabscess
in his brain "clean."

69
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,253
What, you don't trust me?

70
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,422
Are you talking about
the left temporal lobe?

71
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,508
Neat. You can see
through my hand.

72
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,676
- It's just a shadow.
- Or it's an infection.

73
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:24,431
When guys have brain/crotch problems,
it's usually the result of using
one too much and the other too little.

74
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,643
Blood and urine were negative for
syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.

75
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,770
So treat him for all three.
Stat.

76
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,314
Um...negative means
he doesn't have it.

77
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,026
No. Negative means
he probably doesn't have it.
Which means he probably has cancer.

78
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,903
I thought we were wearing
the wrong shoes for cancer.

79
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,614
We're wearing the wrong shoes
for testicular cancer.

80
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,449
They're perfect for lymphoma.

81
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,743
Except Chase's.
They're just goofy.

82
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,747
Lymphoma could cause infiltrants
in his reproductive organs and his brain.

83
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,250
If it's this advanced,
he's dead no matter what we do.

84
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,212
So give him the STD meds
and hope the tests were wrong.

85
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,761
Svinnuk.

86
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,596
Who's the lucky woman?

87
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,473
My wife.

88
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,976
No, I don't want to know
who gets the chocolates.

89
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,144
I want to know who
you're having the affair with.

90
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,481
Fell  on his head as a child.
Tragic.

91
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,650
Norwegian chocolate.

92
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,653
Frankly,
you buy that stuff,
the terrorists win.

93
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,366
Some people bottle up their feelings,
have them come out as physical pain.

94
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,245
Healthy human beings express feelings,
such as affection, by giving gifts.

95
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,038
Gifts express guilt.

96
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,792
The more expensive the expression,
the deeper the guilt. That's a $12 box.

97
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:37,004
So either you haven't
slept with her yet,
or she wasn't that good.

98
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,922
It's not all about sex, House.

99
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,425
Really?
When did that change?

100
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,180
I want to get Depo-Provera.

101
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,226
Actually, at your age,
as long as you're careful,

102
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,937
the risk of you getting
pregnant is pretty limited.

103
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,230
Yeah, but it would
calm me down.

104
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,940
Right? If I get
a high enough dose.

105
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:01,778
You mean
"calm" as in a peaceful lake,
on cool summer evening?

106
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:07,409
Or in the lesser used meaning of,
nothing can ever bother you again
because life has absolutely no meaning?

107
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,829
High dose of Depo-Provera
will chemically castrate you.

108
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,414
Yeah.

109
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,338
Okay. I'm gonna
get up to leave now.

110
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,548
And I'm gonna walk to that door,
turn the handle.

111
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,760
And then you're
suddenly gonna decide that
you have to tell me the truth.

112
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,137
I'm gonna have to turn around
and come all the way back.

113
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,097
See, the thing is,
my leg hurts.

114
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,892
Can we cut the walking
out of the equation?

115
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,311
I love cows.

116
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,403
Any particular...variety?

117
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,697
Guernseys? Holsteins?

118
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,574
Which are the black and white ones?

119
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:48,909
Oh, God.

120
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,120
I  pass a farm
on my way to school.

121
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,872
And they're so beautiful.

122
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,376
They're so majestic.
I dream about them.

123
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,506
Leather shoes, hamburgers.
How can anybody do that to a cow?

124
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,592
Make love, not belts.
It's beautiful.

125
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,928
- I haven't actually--
- Well, relax.

126
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,264
Something we doctors
deal with all the time.

127
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,432
I'm gonna write you
the name of a drug.

128
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,561
You don't need a prescription.
And it looks just like Depo-Provera.

129
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,272
- But does it do the same thing?
- Oh, God, no.

130
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,276
That stuff has
all sorts of nasty side effects.
It's real medicine.

131
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,986
No,  this is all you need.

132
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:27,030
Your frat buddies will
be completely fooled.

133
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,741
Tell them how appalled
the doctor was.

134
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,702
Lots of laughs.

135
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,581
We think you may have
a sexually transmitted disease.

136
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,082
No. It's not possible.

137
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,835
Sir, maybe we should
speak in private?

138
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,670
Have you tested him for this?

139
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,754
The tests were negative.

140
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,756
Well, then it's not that.

141
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,342
So what else could it be?

142
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:48,844
Nothing good.

143
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,930
If you've been having sex,
you have to tell me.

144
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:56,226
I have not had sex
since my divorce.

145
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,231
I didn't ask him
to take the medicine.

146
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,192
I asked you
to give him the medicine.

147
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,110
He hasn't had sex
in over a year.

148
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,404
- He's lying.
- He knows what's at stake.

149
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,073
We should start treating him
for lymphoma right away.

150
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,743
- Maybe if we hit him hard and fast--
- Wilson!

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,953
How long can you
go without sex?

152
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,788
How long can you
go without annoying people?

153
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,790
No, seriously.
Week? Month?

154
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,334
I'm not having an affair.

155
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,128
I didn't say you were.
Not in this conversation.

156
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,588
We're talking about a patient.

157
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,841
People have impulse control.
We don't need sex.

158
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,220
Well, not like air.
But as a biological imperative,
sure we do.

159
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,181
There's two things
we get stupid for.
Money and sex.

160
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,767
And since money rarely
enters the bloodstream...

161
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,353
Was his daughter in the room
when you asked if he'd had sex?

162
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,231
I told him we could talk privately.
He didn't care if she was there.

163
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,317
It's almost noon.
Little girl would go to lunch.

164
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,737
Soon as she's out the door,
you're gonna get paged.
Then you page me.

165
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,616
[Foreman's pager beeps]

166
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,161
Lunch is early, huh?

167
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,585
Hi.

168
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,796
I'm Dr. House.

169
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,508
I hear you'd rather die
than admit you had sex.

170
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,303
I'm sorry. I...
couldn't tell my daughter.

171
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,764
Right. 'Cause she's...what, 22?

172
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,891
I slept with her mom.

173
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,437
She probably knows
that's happened already.

My wife had an affair.
I forgave her.

176
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,366
She had another affair.
And I forgave her again. And...

177
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,160
Amy thinks I was an idiot.

178
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,455
So smart.
You must be very proud.
Roll over.

179
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,333
I assume you've been in love.

180
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,919
Is that the one that
makes your pants feel funny?

182
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,591
Amy is just getting over it.

183
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,510
She barely spoke to her mom
for months actually.

184
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:58,599
If she thought that
it was happening again,
that that's why I got sick--

185
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:08,150
We just happened to be at
the same Italian cheese-tasting thing.

186
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,527
Cheese is the devil's play thing.

187
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,197
It was just the one night.

188
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,741
Oh, you're obviously
completely over her.

189
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,912
Amy thinks love leads you
to make stupid choices.

190
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,372
You're certainly setting
a good example for her.

191
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,124
Yeah. She just doesn't get it.

then nothing great is
ever gonna happen, right?

I guess your testicles
aren't going to explode either.

00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,947
How would an STD do this?

208
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,199
It wouldn't.

It was flash pulmonary edema.

We took a liter of fluid off, but
the problem wasn't with his lungs.
It's his heart.

211
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,501
There are vegetations
obstructing his mitral valve.

212
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,629
It's not an STD.
Lymphoma wouldn't
erupt that suddenly.

213

So what is it, then?
A disease that attacks
his brain, heart, and testicles.

214

- Was it soft?
- Yeah.

- Then why are you--
- Advocating for my patient.

338
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,271
I've got clinic duty.

339
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,483
I need you to get me the files
on everybody who dies here today.

340
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,653
You really think this thing'll
change their decision?

341
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:13,820
Nope.

342
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,830
Mooooo!

343
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,290
I think I broke my ankle.

344
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,876
I was kicked. By a hoof.

345
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,964
I'm so in love.
She was so beautiful.

346
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,341
- Which one?
- One of the black and white ones.

347
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,052
- I'm not sure what type.
- Which "type"? Which one?

348
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,554
I want a name.

349
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,432
- Why would it have a name?
- Well, not "it." She. Or he.

350
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,977
I want to know
her dreams, her hopes.

351
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,728
It's a cow.

352
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,731
Hey, I'm not the one
who said he was in love.

353
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:57,865
People who actually have this condition
rationalize it. They dismiss it.
They don't elevate it to the level of poetry.

354
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,242
Plus there's
a wooden splinter in there.

355
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:04,204
So either you hit yourself
with a two-by-four
or Elsie has a peg leg.

356
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,165
I'm off duty at 6:00.

357
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:09,251
Give yourself another whack,
come back and scam somebody else.

358
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:13,088
I'm sick. And you're a doctor.
You have a duty to help me.

359
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,508
Technically I don't
have to treat anybody.

360
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:22,723
Before running a series of
painful and often humiliating tests.

361
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,645
Whatever you need.

362
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,231
90-year-old woman
died of pneumonia.

363
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,650
Unless she has a bionic heart,
what's next?

364
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:38,447
- Um...baby died in the ICU.
- Babies are useless.

365
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,949
They've got hearts the size
of ping-pong balls. Next?

366
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:44,077
Um...40-year-old male...

367
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,621
Yes?

368
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,122
Heart attack.

369
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,918
If you really cared about me,
you'd find me a better corpse.

370
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,837
There's no other deaths.
There's one woman who
was in a car accident.

371
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,214
Bad one, I hope.

372
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,508
The organ procurement people
have been notified.

373
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,550
Give me her file.

374
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,385
It's  in the ER.
They're still working on her.

375
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,139
- Age?
- About 40.

376
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,850
- Young. Damn.
- Young is good.

377
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,810
- Smoker?
- Don't know.

378
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:09,770
Find out.

379
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,856
She's still alive.
Even if we get on the list,
we can't go near her until--

380
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,358
Overweight?

381
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,610
She's on the hefty side.

382
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,779
Excellent.
Our odds just went up.

383
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,739
What odds?
What is this?

384
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:26,078
60 % of potential donor hearts
get tossed in the trash because
there's something wrong with them.

385
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,996
With fat people,
it's closer to 80.

386
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,706
But if her heart's
no good, then--

387
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:33,460
Big, fat, sloppy heart.
Beats no heart at all.

388
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:54,439
- Are you Mr. Neuberger?
- Yes.

389
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:55,691
I'm Dr. House.

390
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,526
Need to ask you a few questions
about your wife.

391
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,694
Is she gonna be okay?

392
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,654
I'm afraid I don't know that.

393
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,489
Could you tell me
about her accident?

394
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,909
They, uh, think she fell asleep,
went off the road.
That's all they told me.

395
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,453
Any problems with her health
up until now?

396
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:09,413
Why?

397
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,708
Please, it's important.

398
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,168
Um...

399
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,128
she had a fever today,
but otherwise she was--

400
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,546
How high?

401
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,423
About 101.

402
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,218
She hasn't missed a day
of teaching in years.

403
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:26,263
And I should've
made her stay home.

404
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,891
Any other symptoms?

405
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,436
A stomachache. Who cares?
She was in a car crash.

406
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,437
- Mr. Neuberger.
- Yeah.

407
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,940
My name's Ellen Stambler.
I'm the organ procurement coordinator
for Southern New Jersey.

408
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:41,195
I just want to assure you
that we'll treat her organs
with care and dignity.

409
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,157
Her organs?

410
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,037
Laura died?

411
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,290
I--I'm sorry.
I thought, um--

412
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:58,420
She was just pronounced dead.
I thought he was telling you.

413
00:22:58,504 --> 00:22:59,713
I didn't know.

414
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,467
You should never make assumptions.

415
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,472
What did you want from me?

416
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm sorry for your loss.

417
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:17,231
But I need your wife's heart.

418
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,072
The organ procurement coordinator
just left the hospital.

419
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:28,116
Means we got lucky.
Either that or she's getting lunch.

420
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,578
Dead woman's last name
have a "U" or "W"?

421
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,747
You're hacking into
a confidential patient file?

422
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,541
Is that a problem for you?

423
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,210
It's a "U". N-E-U.

424
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:40,295
Berger.

425
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:47,970
Three minutes ago,
her organs were officially
declared not viable.

426
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,055
Time to go dumpster diving.

427
00:23:59,106 --> 00:23:59,898
Hey.

428
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,235
She's got hepatitis C.
Her ALTs are three times normal.

429
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:06,113
With Henry's immune system down,
an infected heart will kill him.

430
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,990
Fortunately,
she didn't have hep C.

431
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,450
- She tested positive.
- Her history says otherwise.

432
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,828
Her husband told me
she was running a fever
with stomach pains.

433
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,122
Not symptomatic of hep C.

434
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,947
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

435
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,908
Hey. What are you doing?

436
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,619
Again, sorry.

437
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,662
But we need to talk.

438
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,167
Mr. Neuberger has every right
to take his wife off the ventilator.

439
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,377
His wife signed
an organ donor card.

440
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,380
Which became invalid when
her organs were turned down.

441
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:08,175
I can use them!
I just need some time.

442
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,135
Committee says
they won't take her heart.

443
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,429
Another committee says
the guy can't have a heart.

444
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,223
It's a marriage made in heaven.

445
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:16,058
I can find a surgical team
that can do this.

446
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:19,019
Classified as experimental,
it's not gonna screw
with their numbers.

447
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,145
- This is what she wanted.
- No.

448
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:21,188
She wanted her organs to help--

449
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,482
She never wanted to
be kept alive on a ventilator.

450
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,526
She's not. She's dead!

451
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,487
She's not in pain.
She's not suffering.
It's just her...

452
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,614
meat we're dealing with here.

453
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,577
- This is my wife.
- Not anymore.

454
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,497
She deserves some respect.
Some dignity.

455
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,207
- I respect the living.
- Right.

456
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,876
That is why you made me think
that you were her doctor.

457
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,587
Made me believe that
maybe there was some hope.

458
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,840
I never said that
I was her doctor.

459
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,092
Fine, you didn't lie.
But you sure as hell
didn't give me any respect.

460
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,553
I am taking her
off the machines. Now.

461
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,306
Nicely played.

462
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,766
It's not over.

463
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:06,233
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Neuberger?

464
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,318
Yeah. Why?

465
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,279
I'm Amy Arrington.

466
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,739
I wanted to thank you.

467
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:25,043
This girl's father will die
by next weekend unless
he gets your wife's heart.

468
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:27,546
House. Don't you think
that's a little manipulative?

469
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,841
No. It's hugely manipulative.

470
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,342
You're an ass.

471
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,679
Hey. Listen!
You take your wife
off life support,

472
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,390
and I'll have forgotten
about this in two weeks.

473
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:41,059
- Gail here, on the other hand--
- Amy.

474
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:42,769
Whatever.

475
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:47,941
You're mad at me.
Fine, I get that.
Take it out on me. Not on her.

476
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,869
Oof!

477
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,755
Fine. Your dad can, uh...
have her heart.

478
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:35,447
Fever. Stomach pain.
Raised liver enzymes.

479
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:36,532
She's sick.

480
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,784
Worse than that.
She's dead.

481
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,870
My point is,
even if it's not hep C,
it's something.

482
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:45,791
They turned her down as a donor
because if we put that heart
into someone, they won't survive.

483
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,668
Whatever made her sick
will kill him.

484
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:50,295
Yeah. So what is it?

485
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,505
Enzymes indicate--

486
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,341
You want us to do
a differential diagnosis
on a dead person?

487
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,592
We're going to cure her.

488
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:56,927
We're going to cure death?

489
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:00,430
[Laughs theatrically like a demon]
Doubt it.

490
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,309
Just want to get the infection
out of her heart before
we get the heart out of her.

491
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,270
The fever indicates an infection.

492
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:09,314
She probably has hep C
and a bad case of the flu.

493
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:13,694
Let's assume, just for fun,
that the answer is something
that might be helpful.

494
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:17,156
Fever and belly pain
could be a gall bladder infection.

495
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,615
Like that.

496
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,868
Do an MRI. Stat.

497
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,586
You really don't need to be here.

498
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,381
I assume, uh,
House is a great doctor.

499
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,883
Why would you assume that?

500
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,887
Because, uh,
when you're that big a jerk,
you're either great or unemployed.

501
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:46,185
No sign of gall bladder infection.
But there was a cyst.

502
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:48,270
Perfectly round.
Now, hep C wouldn't cause--

503
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,063
The question was never,
is it hep C?

504
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:52,983
The question was given
that it's not hep C, what is it?

505
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,152
- Adenoma?
- Not solid enough.

506
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,695
Cavernous hemangioma?

507
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,031
Not vascular enough.

508
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:03,494
What if she was sloppy about
washing her hands after pooping?

509
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,621
Uh...amoeba infection?

510
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:10,459
If the amebiasis started in her liver,
then spread to her blood,
that would explain all her symptoms.

511
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:13,420
Except for the crushed skull, but
I'm assuming that's from the car crash.

512
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,464
I'll start her on
paromomycin and chloroquine.

513
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,757
Ten grams each.

514
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,968
That's...20 times
the normal dose.

515
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:23,514
Right. So we'll destroy
her retinas and damage her hearing.

516
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,266
Whoever wants those parts
is having a very bad day.

517
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,061
Couple hours on the meds,
she'll be feeling great.

518
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,528
Got your labs.

519
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:40,030
- Do you eat guinea pigs?
- No.

520
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,908
How about hamsters or mice?

521
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,117
Humans?

522
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,536
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,246
Is something wrong with me?

524
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,956
Absolutely nothing.

525
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,874
Your blood work is perfect.

526
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,878
You've got lots of vitamins,
minerals. All kinds of proteins.

527
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:59,925
Including a little something
I like to call bovine serum albumin.

528
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,011
Which you get from eating
the animals mentioned.

529
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,138
Or cow.

530
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,101
You don't really worship cows.

531
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:10,352
So I have to wonder,

532
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:16,275
what could be more humiliating than
someone calling your girlfriend a cow
and not being metaphorical?

533
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,834
- Nice.
- It's my mom.

534
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,715
Well, either that's
a very old photograph,
or it's your stepmom.

535
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,801
She goes around the house
in a bikini. Or less.

536
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,678
I-I can't stop
thinking about her.

537
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:48,974
My dad's in Europe.
I'll be watching TV,
she'll give me a massage.

538
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,267
I can't walk for an hour.

539
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,979
- Still. Cows?
- She's my mother!

540
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,189
Step.

541
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:58,233
Please.

542
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:01,987
I just need the medicine
for three months until I graduate
and I move out of the house.

543
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,283
Please.

544
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,121
You're not gonna have
any fun at graduation.

545
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,417
Keep up the good work.

546
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,544
Your shirt is ironed.

547
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:20,088
That means you haven't
told your wife anything.

548
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:22,549
Let's say you're right.

549
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,178
You're saying I'm right?

550
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,264
No. Let is saying.

551
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:33,936
Does it occur to you that maybe
there's some deeper guidance
than "keep your mouth shut"?

552
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:39,358
That maybe a friend might value
concern over glibness? That maybe...

553
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:46,740
Maybe I'm going through
something that I need to have
an actual conversation about?

554
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,953
[Hosue's beeper goes off]

555
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:59,044
Does it occur to you that
if you need that kind of a friend,
you may have made some deeper errors.

556
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,929
Chase:
Her heartbeat's irregular.

557
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,431
Looks like global hypokinesis.

558
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,564
Stop the meds.

559
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,025
You're giving up?

560
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,945
Either we're wrong
and her heart is unusable...

561
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:29,158
or right, but the treatment
we had to give her will
make her heart unusable.

562
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:33,996
I'm sorry.
You can pull the plug now.

563
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,539
Find me another body.

564
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,916
That fat guy on Ortho service
didn't look so hot.

565
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,293
No!

566
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,837
She's not ready.

567
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:45,215
You were ready this morning.

568
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,884
She's not done.

569
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,721
She's gotta save that guy.

570
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:00,522
House:
Alternate theories?

571
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,358
Amebiasis was our best hope.

572
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,528
The fact that her heart rate
went back to normal when
we stopped the meds pretty much--

573
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,322
What's our second best hope?

574
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,073
House, put down the wand.

575
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,658
There's no obstruction.

576
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,203
Maybe we should just biopsy it.

577
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,747
She's a fridge
with the power out.

578
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:20,542
We start poking around inside,
the vegetable goes bad.

579
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:23,462
No offense.

580
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:25,297
I don't see that
we have a lot of choice.

581
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,798
The only way we're
gonna find that infection--

582
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,050
Cameron:
What if it's not an infection?

583
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:31,929
Toxins can cause similar symptoms.
Especially if whatever it is did liver damage.

584
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:34,264
Her, uh, toxin screen was clean.

585
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:37,434
Those things never cover
for any of the really cool toxins.

586
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:40,479
Run the screen again
for whatever you can think of.

587
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,689
You, keep the other patient alive.

588
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:44,483
You, check out the school.

589
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:48,320
And I seem to need
o hire another doctor
to go search her home.

590
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:51,698
Come on.

591
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,746
If she was taking
any medications,
I'd know about it.

592
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,125
Did your wife dye her hair?

593
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:03,544
No.

594
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,546
Her mom never went gray.

595
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:06,588
She didn't either.

596
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,799
Guess this must be yours, then.

597
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,802
Can you think of anything else
she might've lied to you about?

598
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:15,472
Any drugs she "gave up"
when she married you?

599
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,402
How are you feeling, sir?

600
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,320
Mr. Arrington?

601
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:31,905
Mr. Arrington?

602
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,615
[Monitor starts beeping]

603
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:35,826
What's going on?

604
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,953
His heart's not pumping
enough blood to his brain.

605
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,663
We're gonna have to
give it some help.

606
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,748
Get the balloon ready.

607
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:48,338
You use this drawer?

608
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,841
Neuberger:
No, that's for her vitamins.

609
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,218
And sleeping pills.

610
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:55,470
She never took sleeping pills.

611
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,055
Okay.

612
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,018
You on a diet?

613
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:02,603
No.

614
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:11,278
I guess you never really
know someone, do you?

615
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,281
Quite the insight.

616
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,617
She lied to you
about her hair color.

617
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:19,578
And didn't want you to know
she thought she was fat.

618
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:23,290
Unless you never lied to her
about anything that huge.

619
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:26,043
And then you can
probably let those slide.

620
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,339
Diet pills could've
messed her up.

621
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,841
Raised the live enzymes
and caused the bellyache.

622
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:34,426
But not the fever.

623
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,512
Maybe something else
set off the fever.

624
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:37,930
Like what?

625
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,390
Before I show you these,
they were in a locked drawer
in her desk.

626
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,852
The vice principal said that
Laura must've confiscated them.
They've had some problems with--

627
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,104
Neither interesting nor helpful.

628
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,359
This at least is interesting.

629
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,736
[Scoffs]
No, it's not.

630
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,739
Sex with teenagers
isn't interesting?
Where did you grow up?

631
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,909
It isn't helpful.
Teenage boys aren't toxins.

632
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:02,538
What if the cyst isn't a cyst?

633
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:05,082
Then we have nothing to go on.

634
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,751
I said it's not a cyst.
I didn't say it was nothing.

635
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,127
What if it's a scar?

636
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:10,963
Foreman:
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome?

637
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,048
You're pushing gonorrhea again?

638
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,842
You got anything better?

639
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:18,220
Test her.
And start her on ceftriaxone.

640
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,068
What are you testing for now?

641
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,197
Just some more infections.

642
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,297
She's positive for gonorrhea.

643
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:59,219
I think that's the first time
those words have been uttered in joy.

644
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:00,387
Meds are started.

645
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,639
Her heart should be clear enough
to use in about four or five hours.

646
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:04,349
I'll go tell the families.

647
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:05,684
He's in a coma.

648
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,352
Start him on dobutamine.

649
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,729
Already did.

650
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:12,816
We either do the surgery now
or we find him a new brain too.

651
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,862
House, she's still got
a significant amount of
gonorrhea in her system.

652
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:21,074
Hopefully tomorrow,
it'll be in his system.

653
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:25,037
I need two O.R.s
and the transplant team.

654
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,125
What is it?

655
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:38,967
Amy:
What's going on?

656
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,261
- Is he getting a heart?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

657
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,651
I assume this means
you, uh, you found out
what was wrong with Laura?

658
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:05,035
She had a amebiasis.

659
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,871
We just found a different way
to get rid of it.

660
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:11,625
Thank you.

661
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,673
That was kind of you.

662
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:20,217
I didn't want him
going postal on us.

663
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:24,054
Soon as his wife's heart's in our hands,
you can tell him about the gonorrhea.

664
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:26,932
He's gotta be tested.

665
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:30,143
Preferably before he gets
any sympathy sex.

666
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,053
Paddles.

667
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,810
50 joules.

668
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,232
Charging.

669
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,531
Charging.

670
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:31,413
[Heart begins to beat]

671
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,124
Let's take him off bypass.

672
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:56,688
Mr. Neuberger.
There's something
I need to tell you.

673
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,442
The last, uh...

674
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:04,905
year or so, uh...

675
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:08,075
Laura was kind of
distant with me.

676
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:09,868
I don't know why.

677
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:13,789
I thought maybe
she was having an affair.

678
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:17,417
But...not Laura.
And I'm not excusing myself,

679
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:22,089
but when I was traveling
during Christmas, I had a...

680
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,675
I had a one-night stand.

681
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,510
I got gonorrhea.

682
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,849
- Are you sure--
- Yeah.

683
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,227
I should've said
something to you.

684
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,355
But I didn't want to believe
that I gave it to her.

685
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:39,982
That's what made her sick,and...

686
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:43,652
that was why she got
into the accident.

687
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:07,718
Cecile?

688
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,137
Am I dead?

689
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:12,431
Hopefully not for a long time.

690
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,225
Why are you here?

691
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:17,102
Amy called me.

692
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:21,440
If you do Mom again,
you gotta wear a condom.

693
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,693
You're gonna have gonorrhea
in your system for a while.

Could I stay with you
for a few days?

701
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:11,198
You idiot.

702
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:12,449
You told her.

703
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:14,409
She told me.

704
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,330
Things have been
crappy at home lately.

705
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,624
I figured I wasn't
spending enough time there.

706
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,501
I figured...

707
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,423
It turns out, you're right.

708
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,717
It's always about sex.

709
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:34,680
She's been having an affair.
