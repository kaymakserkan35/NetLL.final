1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:01,993
NARRATOR: Previously on House.

2
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,467
You high, popo?

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,434
HOUSE: A cop
with a sense of humor.

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,564
You check the cop car.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,768
AIso check his personal car,
work, home.

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,809
Foreman, get out!

7
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,210
Am I the only one
who finds this funny?

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,214
You stole my article.
I wouldn't do that.

9
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,216
We're not friends.
We're colleagues.

10
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:19,811
(EXCLAIMS) Son of a bitch!

11
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,114
Now we're both exposed.

12
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,655
In 10 minutes time...
You die, I die.

13
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:24,985
It's not gonna happen.

14
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,184
Time of death.

15
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,124
1 2:26 p.m.

16
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,160
I need a bone saw.

17
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,030
I'm sorry. I wish I could.
They said you won't...

18
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,296
I just want a Iittle
tiny slice
of this guy's brain.

19
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,736
That's all I need,
just enough to tell me
what's killing Foreman.

20
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,640
A thin slice of Joe's brain
could also cause
a public health crisis.

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,577
It's not a good idea
to scream "fire" every time
somebody Iights a match.

22
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,307
Don't downplay this, House.

23
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,043
You put both of them
in isolation for a reason.

24
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:54,518
Joe's death elevates
this situation
to a Biosafety Level 3.

25
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,284
Level 3.
Did you call Jack Bauer?
I called the CDC.

26
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,087
Well, tell them I'II be
really, really careful.

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,993
We don't have the proper
equipment for you to be
really, really careful.

28
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,896
You can do whatever you want
to Foreman, but the CDC
will do this autopsy.

29
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,695
Whatever. The point is,
we'II be Iucky to get results
in three days.

30
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,259
I told them
how urgent this is.
And they told you...

31
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,362
"We'II have the results
in three days."

32
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,532
Oh, that's a shame.

33
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,302
Because Foreman
will never get to know
what it was.

34
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,503
He'II be dead in 36 hours.

35
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,270
Maybe this is a toxin.
Maybe it's not contagious
at all.

36
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,474
You're killing Foreman
because of a "maybe."

37
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,951
Well, you have 36 hours
to figure out which one it is.

38
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,461
Foreman. Come here, fast.

39
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,498
What's going on?
When are they doing
the autopsy?

40
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,828
You're doing it, now.

41
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,368
You ever studied
how they used to do
ice pick Iobotomies?

42
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,063
I read about it in med school.
Why would I...

43
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,936
Shove an ice pick
into the eye socket
just above the tear duct,

44
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,066
bang it a couple times
with a hammer,
get a sample.

45
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,304
What's going on, House?
Foreman, you can't do it!

46
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:56,075
You'd be in violation of...
Can't do the time
if you're not alive.

47
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,810
CUDDY: You! I need you
to suit up.

48
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,715
Get that equipment
away from Dr. Foreman.

49
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,687
Take your time, guys.
Just tell them to go slow.

50
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,779
It won't be your fault.

51
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,451
Foreman, we don't even know
what kind of contagion
we're dealing with.

52
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,221
Which is why we need
to chop into the guy's head!

53
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,921
It's dangerous.
Not to you, Foreman!

54
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,861
There are other ways
to diagnose you.

55
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,865
Yeah? You have the answer?

56
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,398
Foreman, do it now!

57
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,460
I am warning you! Do not...

58
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,170
What are you doing?

59
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,871
That didn't feel right.

60
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,636
He's blind.

61
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,746
But he thinks he can see.

62
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,181
Same as the cop.

63
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,719
We need something
to bag the sample.

64
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,254
Forget it.
You just biopsied a mattress.

65
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,883
No, no, no. I'm fine.
House, there's the sample.
Get it, test it!

66
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,317
You got to test that sample!

67
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,455
Apparently I was optimistic
about the 36 hours.

68
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,365
Intractable,
unbearable pain is up next.

69
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,932
Sure you don't wanna
reconsider that whole
autopsy thing?

70
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:36,606
Physically, his eyes are fine.
The problem's isolated
to his brain.

71
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,015
Damage to the occipital Iobe
extends from
the primary visual cortex...

72
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,077
We should retest him
for bacterial meningitis.

73
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,146
If it was meningitis,
we'd all be sick.

74
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,521
His CSF might show signs...

75
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,459
LP's pointless.
We already did
a brain biopsy.

76
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,893
It was negative.

77
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,764
Toxic mold.
If it was toxic mold,
I'd be sick.

78
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,270
How do we know
you're not sick?
Do I seem happy to you?

79
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,396
Never.

80
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,461
(SCOFFS)

81
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,200
It was funny.

82
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,266
Well, Iet's assume it's not
blood-borne.

83
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,869
If you start cracking jokes,
we can reassess.

84
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,211
In the meantime, stay away
from people and animals
that you care about.

85
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,583
Guillain Barré.

86
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,887
Neither of them had
any sort of paralysis.

87
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,519
Joe could have died
before the paralysis
had a chance to present.

88
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,119
What about arbovirus?

89
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,697
Start treatment.
For arbovirus?

90
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,233
You think our Jersey beat cop
has been spending
a Iot of time

91
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,599
exploring deep, dark Africa?

92
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,138
Treatment for everything,
Iikely or unlikely.

93
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,833
If you can think of it,
treat for it.

94
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,842
Mixing that many meds
will create all sorts of
toxic interactions.

95
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,004
We'II box his Iiver, trash
his kidneys. There's got to be
a better way.

96
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,775
Of course
there's a better way!

97
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,842
It's that body sitting
in the room with him
that Cuddy won't Iet us touch!

98
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,958
Bacterials, virals, toxins,
fungals, parasites,
it's got to be one of them.

99
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,459
Where are you going?

100
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,018
See if I can find
another brain to biopsy.

101
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,364
They're gonna Iock Joe up
downstairs until
the CDC gets here.

102
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,937
Foreman, you can't see.

103
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,033
Right.

104
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,974
House wants to start you
on some meds.
They're in the air Iock.

105
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,036
For what?
Leading candidate
is toxic mold.

106
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,906
Is Cameron sick?

107
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,813
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

108
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,716
You're casting your net
a Iittle wider than
toxic mold, aren't you?

109
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,722
Guillain Barré
is also on the table.

110
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,487
This is an oval shape.
That's either an "L" or a "7."

111
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,519
I'm guessing an "L."
Levofloxacin, because
you can't rule out bacteria.

112
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:36,132
8-0-0. That's the dosage
for acyclovir
in case it's viral.

113
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,035
Square.
No, more Iike a rhombus.

114
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,268
That's fluconazole for fungus.
There's about
eight others here.

115
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,741
You're treating me
for everything.

116
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,072
You have no idea
what I've got.

117
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,044
House thinks this is
the best course of action.

118
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,274
House is desperate.
House is never desperate.

119
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,941
Something we give you
will work.

120
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,645
Yeah, we should start treating
all patients this way.

121
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,779
When they get sick,
they just take everything.

122
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,846
It's better
than doing nothing.

123
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,264
(PHONE RINGING)

124
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,814
Hello?

125
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,516
I'm at the cop's place.

126
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,621
I need to retrace your steps.

127
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,253
You don't think the "treat him
for everything" approach
is enough?

128
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,797
Where did you
start your search?
The kitchen.

129
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,333
Okay, well, tell me
everything you did,
everything you touched.

130
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,699
If you went to the john,
I want to know when and why.

131
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,603
It started with samples
from the mold in his sink.

132
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,588
What next?
That's it. Then I Ieft.

133
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,179
What do we do now?

134
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,248
Wait for Steve McQueen
to get giddy.

135
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,883
Excellent plan.

136
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,663
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

137
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,846
Hey, Dad, it's Eric.

138
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,478
I'm not doing too good.

139
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:33,874
(GRUNTS)

140
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,752
How's Foreman?

141
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,392
You're accessing a webcam?
Cuddy's shower.

142
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,528
Are you a fan
of the Brazilian? I...

143
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,294
Is that your kitchen?

144
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,197
Well, obviously
I couldn't bring him here.

145
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,997
He's been exposed
to whatever Foreman's got.

146
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,471
You infected Steve?
Why didn't you just get
a rat from the pet store?

147
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,737
Because I needed one
with a clean medical history.

148
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,305
Who knows
what kind of antibiotics
they gave those rats?

149
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,808
So this is your plan,
just sit here
and watch your rat all day?

150
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,681
It shouldn't take Iong.

151
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,551
I've got the AC blasting,
I soaked the floor
of his cage.

152
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,090
As soon as he gets sick,
I do an autopsy.

153
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,319
As soon as he's dead.

154
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,328
Right after he gets sick,
there's a good chance
he'II get hit in the head

155
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,297
with a cane-shaped object.

156
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,196
Normally you just use
your patients as Iab rats.

157
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,066
It's a nice change.

158
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,110
First symptom is euphoria.

159
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,204
Well, how do you know
if a rat's euphoric?

160
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,808
He doesn't usually climb
on his water bottle Iike that,
does he?

161
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,182
The seizures
only seem to happen
when she's in her car seat.

162
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,025
She starts to rock and grunt.

163
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,655
Is she responsive?
No, no.

164
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,632
It's Iike she's in a zone

165
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,601
and her abdominal muscles
become dystonic.

166
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,439
Big word. Someone's been
on the Interweb.

167
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,805
I Iooked up a few articles
on epilepsy.

168
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,208
You know, there's actually
some really great
youth soccer Ieagues

169
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,713
that would cater specifically
to her special needs,

170
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:12,547
and I think it might explain
why she's been having
a hard time in preschool.

171
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,985
Well, Iet's confirm
your diagnosis
before you have her held back.

172
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,752
Strobing Iights
and high-pitched sounds
can provoke a seizure.

173
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,861
(WHOOPING)

174
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,358
You're a goof.
Takes one to know one, Ioser.

175
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,560
Wait, that means I'm a Ioser.
Scratch that.

176
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,168
These episodes,
she gets sweaty afterwards?

177
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,503
Soaking wet.

178
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,039
And does she seem upset
by them or just tired?

179
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,273
No. She kind of thinks
it's funny.

180
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:47,111
You mix rocking, grunting,
sweating and dystonia
with concerned parents

181
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,746
and you get
an amateur diagnosis
of epilepsy.

182
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,847
In actuality,
all your Iittle girl is doing

183
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,985
is saying
"yoo-hoo to the hoo-hoo."

184
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,588
She's what?
Marching the penguin.

185
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,065
Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood.

186
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,927
Finding Nemo.

187
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:04,992
(GIGGLES)

188
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,332
That was funny.

189
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,742
It's called
"gratification disorder."
Sort of a misnomer.

190
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,643
If one was unable
to gratify oneself,
that would be a disorder.

191
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,647
Are you saying
she's masturbating?

192
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,014
I was trying to be discreet.
There's a child in the room.

193
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,074
This is horrifying.

194
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,881
Epilepsy is horrifying.

195
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,422
Teach your girl about privacy
and she'II be fine.

196
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,458
There you go.
Thank you.

197
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,728
One afternoon,
and you're on pace
to set the record

198
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,628
for most patients
seen in a month.

199
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,394
You're upset
that I'm doing clinic hours?

200
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,265
Wow, that is so Iike
rain on your wedding day.

201
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,499
For the past three hours,
I have been on the phone
with the CDC while you are...

202
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,871
How's that going, by the way?
They promised to expedite...

203
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,240
Tough to do an autopsy
when they haven't even
picked up the body.

204
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,212
It's tough to treat
your patient when you're not
even on the same floor.

205
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,338
Go. CIinic is covered.

206
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,746
I go watch the meds
drip into his IV,

207
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,477
you think that'II make
the treatment work faster?

208
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,487
Go to your office, play with
your ball, write on your
white board, insult your team.

209
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,418
Do whatever it is that you do
to figure things out.

210
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,983
Feeling guilty?
It's not too Iate
to change your mind.

211
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,926
Go call the CDC,
tell them
you were just joshing.

212
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,521
Keep avoiding Foreman's case
until he dies.

213
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,328
Then I'II drown in guilt.

214
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,302
CAMERON: Feeling any better?

215
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,637
How are you doing?

216
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,263
I'm not the patient.

217
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,070
Is your sed rate elevated?

218
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,745
No. So far,
it Iooks Iike I Iucked out.

219
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:26,043
Cameron, it Iooks Iike
you Ieft the tourniquet
on the bed.

220
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,589
You can see again?
The treatment's working.

221
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,084
The question is,
which treatment?

222
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,961
We'II start weaning him off
one at a time.
Which one do we start with?

223
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,763
I don't care
if you do it alphabetically.

224
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,061
Just stay on top
of his vision.

225
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,568
First sign of regression
means we've taken him off
the wrong one.

226
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:49,199
Latest blood work.
Foreman's amylase and Iipase
Ievels are three times normal.

227
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,209
The pancreas is failing.

228
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,302
A toxic side effect
of his meds.

229
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,503
Philosophical question:
How do you wanna die?

230
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,605
OId age.

231
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:30,171
Your choice is currently
between 4 hours from now
and 14 hours from now.

232
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,114
So I'm assuming that means
you want the Iatter.

233
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,881
The cocktail's working.
My vision's almost
completely restored.

234
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,356
The meds are curing what's in
your head, but they're
trashing your pancreas.

235
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,189
That's why you're puking
and you can't stand up
without screaming.

236
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,853
So Iower the dosages.

237
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,591
Less stress on my pancreas,
still battle the infection.

238
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,498
Lower dosages
will still be toxic.
I don't care!

239
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,596
I can handle the pain
of the pancreatitis.

240
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,401
I don't think
you can handle Iife
without a pancreas.

241
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,304
If we keep you on these meds,

242
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,907
you'II spend the Iast
four hours of your Iife
being able to see.

243
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,617
We take you off,
you'II go blind again.

244
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,886
But it'II give us time
to figure out
what's eating your brain.

245
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,950
(INHALING)

246
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,192
Fine. What do we do next?

247
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,792
MAN: Eric?

248
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,101
Dad?

249
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:34,572
Yeah, you two can get
caught up Iater. Sir,
I need you to come with me.

250
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,951
House, what is this?

251
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,717
He's not a "what,"
he's a "who." They even have
the right to vote now.

252
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,918
Rodney Foreman, Cuddy.
Cuddy, Rodney Foreman.

253
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,496
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
This is Foreman's dad.

254
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,031
Yeah, I got that.

255
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,293
And Dr. Cuddy here
is the Dean of Medicine.

256
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,494
Remember that cool autopsy
I was telling you about,

257
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,561
the one that would save
your son's Iife?

258
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,538
She's the one who can give us
the green Iight to do it.

259
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,043
I understand
you don't want them to do it.

260
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,975
Dr. House
didn't seem to know why.

261
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,682
Mr. Foreman,
I am doing everything I can
to get the CDC...

262
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,517
Won't be soon enough.
...and my decision to follow

263
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,524
public health
safety protocols...

264
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,756
Oh, don't blame the rules.
Don't hang this on policy
and protocol.

265
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,696
I'm well aware
that it may cost
your son his Iife,

266
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:31,327
just as I am well aware that
my decision has a devastating
effect on family and friends,

267
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,928
without having them paraded
in front of me.

268
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,036
Your son has an unknown,

269
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,174
contagious, deadly infection.

270
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,513
If we don't contain it here,
even more people
could be at risk.

271
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,176
And I am capable
of empathizing
with those people too,

272
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,415
without having them
paraded in front of me.

273
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,863
I understand.

274
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,484
What's wrong with your hand?

275
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,887
It's called
a muscle contracture.

276
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,491
I thought this thing
was in your brain.

277
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,529
It is. It just means
the infection's moved

278
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,725
to the primary motor cortex,
which controls the muscles.

279
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,463
Aren't you glad
you sent me to med school?

280
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,869
Does it hurt?
No.

281
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,606
Is it gonna?

282
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,969
The other guy,

283
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,841
he didn't seem to suffer
too much.

284
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,646
He just went in his sleep.

285
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,761
Steve's still acting normal.
No sign of contractures.

286
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,098
They got the cop's body
in a Iocked, airtight bag.

287
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,335
And a guard on the door.
Those feds
are seriously paranoid.

288
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,739
He hasn't gotten up
to pee in hours. He's due.

289
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,007
You haven't sprinkled
Senokot granules on his donut?

290
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,912
His bowels would open up
Iike the Red Sea.

291
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,416
He wouldn't eat the donut.

292
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,017
Have you seriously
been down here for hours?

293
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,146
No.

294
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,050
I had to pee a couple times.

295
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,990
You've got to stop
blaming Cuddy for this.

296
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,051
Given that it is her fault,
that seems appropriate.

297
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,596
That part is her fault.

298
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,894
The part
where somebody wasted his time
in the basement

299
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,696
plotting the overthrow of
a government agency,
that one's on you.

300
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,170
Only thing I can do is think.
You can pretty much
do that anywhere.

301
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,033
As Iong as
no one's bugging me.

302
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,778
RODNEY: Did you call
your brother?

303
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,273
No.

304
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,074
Did you?
No.

305
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,777
It's not a big deal.

306
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,722
I sure would have Iiked
to see Mom, though.

307
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,960
You know
she can't travel anymore.

308
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,901
You tell her?

309
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,593
Why?

310
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,239
Just upset her for a while.

311
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,639
Then she wouldn't remember
for a while.

312
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,476
She should know.

313
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,083
She's Iost a Iot
of who she was.

314
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,359
She can't deal with something
Iike this.

315
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,899
And you can?

316
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,073
I still know
you're going
to a better place.

317
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,713
It's easy for you, isn't it?

318
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:12,022
As Iong as you believe
I'm going to a better place,
dying ain't so bad.

319
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,853
I don't want you to be afraid.

320
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:22,663
If I'm not afraid of dying,
what the hell
should I be afraid of, Dad?

321
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,064
I thought you believed.

322
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,402
I did.

323
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,175
I'm not so sure anymore.

324
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,017
I'm going to pray
for you, Son.

325
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,388
I suggest you do the same.

326

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

regressing and he's reached

00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,084
Why would this go faster
in Foreman? What's different?

332
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,023
Could be a different strain
of the same disease?

333
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,857
Right! We were wasting
all this time Iooking
for an unknown disease.

334
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,694
We should have be Iooking for
a different strain
of an unknown disease.

335
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,200
Joe's a cop.
He's into physical fitness.

336
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,965
He could have had
a more powerful immune system,
stronger metabolism.

337
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,633
Foreman's black.
What?

338
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,437
How Iong have you been sitting
on this information?

339
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,970
Lupus, gout, glaucoma,
osteoarthritis, hypertension,
diabetes, stop me anytime,

340
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,913
they all affect black people
more than whites.

341
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,211
Check everything.

342
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,844
Bacterials, fungals,
toxins, parasites.

343
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,480
Look for anything
with a documented
racial disparity.

344
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,918
Wait.

345
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,288
The rat's showing symptoms?
No.

346
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,928
He's completely healthy.

347
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,362
Maybe that's the difference
between Foreman and the cop.

348
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,167
How you feeling?

349
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,710
Why are you here?

350
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,915
Because you're a friend,
and I should be here.

351
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,915
I'm sorry House used my dad
to try and manipulate you.

352
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,819
You've got integrity.

353
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,623
You aren't going to change
your mind just because you're
confronted by my father.

354
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,685
Thank you.

355
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,289
Just Iike
I'm not gonna forgive you,

356
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,335
just because you come by here
and ask how I'm feeling.

357
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,768
You know I've had no choice.

358
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,772
Of course you had a choice!

359
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,569
Regulations are clear.

360
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,134
And the punishment
for violating
those regulations,

361
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,043
is it death?

362
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:27,281
Because frankly, I'm okay
if you get a fine,
a suspension...

363
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:31,880
Hell, you can spend
a couple years in jail
if it saves my Iife!

364
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,947
(POUNDING)

365
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,920
You're dying too fast.
Couldn't agree more.

366
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,555
Hey, Cuddy.
Having a nice visit?

367
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,390
What's that?

368
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,895
Legionella...
Legionella pneumophilia.

369
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,906
And why are you
carrying a vial of it
around with you?

370
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,704
Foreman was perfectly healthy
before he got this infection,

371
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,039
but our cop wasn't.

372
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,544
He had Legionnaire's disease,

373
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,049
and our cop didn't turn into
brain food until we cured
the Legionella.

374
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,051
The Legionella
slowed down the disease.

375
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,876
Why would that happen?

376
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,888
No idea.
I just know that it did.

377
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,617
So you want to infect Foreman?

378
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,353
You gonna tattle to the CDC?

379
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,827
The meds can't help me,
but a disease can?

380
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,558
Forget it.
Just take the pain away.
Put me under.

381
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,260
If I put you under,
I can't monitor your pain.

382
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,270
If I can't monitor your pain,
I won't know
if the Legionella's working.

383
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,636
I'm not consenting
to you giving me...

384
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,006
What was that?

385
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,804
Wish there could have been
a puff of smoke or something.

386
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,779
Would have been
much more dramatic.

387
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,341
Keep your slippers on.

388
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,983
Wouldn't want you
to cut your foot.

389
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,784
You feeling any better?

390
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,425
I can't breathe.
I'm dizzy
and I can barely hear anything

391
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,191
over the sounds
of my Iungs crackling.

392
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,561
That's the Legionella.

393
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:52,069
Oh, you figured that out from
the symptoms or from the vial
of stuff tossed in my room?

394
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,799
I'm trying to be professional
here, and there's no reason
to be nasty.

395
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,738
I'm in pain.
So is House.

396
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:57,866
And he's a delight.

397
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,638
He doesn't try to kill
his colleagues.

398
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,735
(BEEPING)

399
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,677
You can remove
the thermometer now.

400
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,190
It's down almost
a whole degree.
How's the pain?

401
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,818
Great. It's the good kind.

402
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,392
How bad is it
compared to an hour ago?

403
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,160
No worse.

404
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,565
WILSON:
Is the Legionella helping?

405
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,271
Yeah.

406
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,581
Good.
But not great.

407
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,113
It didn't fix anything,
it just slowed it down.

408
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,676
The whole point
was to give Steve a Iittle
more time to get sick.

409
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,279
What are you gonna do
if he never gets sick?

410
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,889
Brilliant.

411
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:54,360
Cameron, what type
of illnesses
affect humans but not rats?

412
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,832
Why are you asking me that?

413
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,369
Because I'm sure
that you spent the first
1 2 years of your Iife

414
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,836
dreaming of being a vet.

415
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,463
The rat is not getting sick.

416
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,440
Cameron is not getting sick.
Sorry.

417
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,499
It's okay,
it's not your fault.

418
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,871
Presumably, you're still
healthy because whatever
it is, it's not blood-borne.

419
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,472
Steve has no excuse.
He did everything
that Foreman did.

420
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,780
Some bacterial infections
don't affect rats.

421
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,151
Foreman tested negative
for every bacterial infection
that would affect his brain.

422
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:21,181
And what infections could
he be positive for
but test negative for?

423
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,395
When we test for infections,
we Iook for antibodies.

424
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,591
Now, what if the patient
is infected
but has no antibodies?

425
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,931
What if the body
is not fighting the infection?

426
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,596
Why would...
I asked first.

427
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,833
Let's start with the "what."
We'II deal with
the "why" Iater.

428
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:39,001
If the body doesn't recognize
the infection,
our tests come back negative,

429
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,068
and the disease
rampages through
the body unstopped.

430
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,842
Exactly Iike the cop
and exactly Iike Foreman.

431
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,879
Now, what if the patient
was then exposed
to a second infection,

432
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,044
Iike Legionella?

433
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,849
The body would recognize
that infection,
increase the white count,

434
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,412
send in the troops
to start fighting,

435
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,959
and the initial infection
would get caught
in the crossfire.

436
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,288
So the question becomes

437
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,330
what type of bacterial
infection affects humans
but not rats,

438
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,763
and the human body
would be unlikely
to recognize?

439
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,100
HOUSE: The answer is Iisteria.

440
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,200
I'm starting you on
amp and gent.

441
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,468
So, you're basing this theory
on the tests being negative

442
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,134
and your rat being healthy?

443
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,201
And the fact that
Legionnaire's is helping you.

444
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,646
But the medicine
you want to give me
will put an end to that.

445
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,774
Yeah.

446
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,877
And if it's not Iisteria,
all the gent will do is
cure the Legionnaire's disease

447
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,718
and put whatever is killing me
back into overdrive.

448
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,248
Stop asking me questions
based on the premise
that I'm wrong.

449
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,793
The antibiotics
are in the airlock.

450
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,905
I think the first biopsy
didn't give us the answer

451
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,770
because you didn't go
deep enough.

452
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,644
I want you to do
a white matter brain biopsy.

453
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,710
Absolutely. Don't blame you.

454
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:54,081
The world is such
a complicated place if you've
got higher reasoning skills.

455
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,315
I'm often jealous
of small animals
and retarded children.

456
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,155
Take the antibiotics.

457
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,785
There can be minimal damage
if it's done right,

458
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,456
if the surgeons drill
where I tell them to drill.

459
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,522
One slip, you could spend
the rest of your Iife
not being able

460
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,794
to keep your drool
in your mouth.

461
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,563
I'd rather be disabled
than dead.

462
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,934
Sure! I make it Iook
oh-so-sexy.

463
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,939
It's actually not as glamorous
as you might think.

464
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,033
The biopsy
will tell us for sure
what's wrong.

465
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,112
The antibiotics
could do the same thing!

466
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,441
"Could," not "will."

467
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,572
We try it, we see.

468
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,208
The antibiotics
will bring back the pain!

469
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,553
Pain makes us
make bad decisions.

470
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:43,827
Fear of pain
is almost as big a motivator.

471
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,699
Look, we still have time.

472
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:54,103
I will do that biopsy
if I have to.
But not a moment before.

473
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:16,258
Start Foreman
on IV antibiotics.
Where's his dad?

474
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,532
Where you're supposed to be
when your son is dying.

475
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,163
He's not with him.
He's in the chapel.

476
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,738
Oh, man...

477
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,544
I started your son
on a new course of treatment.

478
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,814
If it works, he'II get better.

479
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,015
If it doesn't, he won't.

480
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,547
While he's not getting better,

481
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,749
he's going to experience
so much pain

482
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,556
that we'II have to put him
in a chemically-induced coma

483
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,756
while we figure out
what to do next.

484
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,527
My son says
you're a manipulative bastard.

485
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,468
It's a pet name.
I call him "Dr. BIing."

486
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,804
I assume you're here
for a reason.
What do you want from me?

487
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,537
When your son is in a coma,

488
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,582
you're the one who's gonna
have to make
the medical decisions for him.

489
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,675
Whatever you decide is fine.

490
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,888
You don't care what I do?
I'm not a doctor.
What do I know,

491
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,187
except what Eric tells me?

492
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,958
He says you're the best doctor
he's ever worked with.

493
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,879
I need your help.

494
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,284
There's nothing I can give you
for the pain.
I want to be put out.

495
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,115
I can have a nurse in here
in five minutes.
No.

496
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,414
Once I'm out,
I might not come back.

497
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,820
I've never done a will.

498
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,661
I'II call a Iawyer for you.

499
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,529
I want you to be
my medical proxy.

500
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,071
AII the things
that piss me off
about you in House's office,

501
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,407
you're too emotional and
too caring, too cautious...

502
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,775
They're all good things
on this floor.

503
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,905
Your dad is...
No.

504
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,549
He cares about you.
So do you.

505
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,143
I can't do this.

506
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,891
We expect family members
to make decisions
about their Ioved ones

507
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,986
after a 10-minute briefing,
that we're agonizing over

508
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,361
even with years
of medical experience.

509
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,993
That's from my article.

510
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,997
I'm sorry, AIIison.

511
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,973
I shouldn't have stolen
your article.

512
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,236
I shouldn't have exposed you.

513
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,678
You were a friend.

514
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,044
I need to know
that we're okay.

515
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,513
No.

516
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,421
I'II be your proxy,
but we're not okay.

517
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:02,598
You're scared you're dying
and it's the only reason
you want to set things right.

518
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,033
We're gonna get you better
first and then,

519
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,667
if you still wanna apologize,
I'II be around.

520
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,836
I'II call that Iawyer.

521
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,425
Any improvements?
No.

522
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,898
As far as we can tell, the
only thing the antibiotics are
treating is the Legionella.

523
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,026
I think we need to consider
alternate theories.

524
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,160
Like what?

525
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,568
We do the biopsy. We...

526
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,230
Give the antibiotics
more time.

527
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,832
There is no more time.
The pain
is almost unbearable already.

528
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,436
So he's almost
in unbearable pain.
He's not almost dead!

529
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,773
Which means we have more time.

530
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,824
Mr. Foreman?

531
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,221
We need to put your son
in a coma.

532
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,292
You should be there.

533
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,399
It's a medical procedure,
right?

534
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,665
Yeah.

535
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:22,168
But once we put him out,
if we don't solve this,

536
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,080
he won't wake up.

537
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,383
What should I say?

538
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,853
Should I talk to him
Iike it's going to be okay?

539
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,427
Or should I be saying goodbye?

540
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:42,899
I need to know
what people say when...

541
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,559
Just tell him you Iove him.

542
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,687
Hey, Son.
Hey, Dad.

543
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,191
It's going to be okay.

544
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,770
You don't know that.

545
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,969
I know.

546
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:27,942
You don't.

547
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,382
I don't wanna miss you.

548
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,351
I Iove you too, Dad.

549
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,500
Hey,

550
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,866
it's gonna be okay.

551
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,013
Can we do this now?
Yeah, of course.

552
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,030
I accept your apology.

553
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,622
Why weren't you with Foreman?

554
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:50,891
I hang out in the basement,
you rag on me. I stay in my
office, you rag on me.

555
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,725
Honky just can't buy a break.

556
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,059
Do the biopsy.

557
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:58,068
Based on the cop's
progression, I figure he's got
about another four hours...

558
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,398
You figure?

559
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,305
You're playing
Russian roulette,
but the gun's pointed at him.

560
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,206
No. Cutting open his head
is what's dangerous.

561
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,109
Oh, it's dangerous.
Well, what would people think?

562
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,372
The reason
you don't see patients

563
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,438
is because if you know them,
you'II give a crap about them.

564
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,211
I know you.
If you give a crap,

565
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,149
you stop making
outrageous calls.

566
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,244
If this was any other patient,
you'd have damned the risk

567
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,913
and cut their head open
a Iong time ago.

568
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,288
He's out. The EEG shows
he's still in pain.

569
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,088
The antibiotics have had
more than enough time.

570
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,321
We're doing the brain biopsy.

571
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,660
Not unless you people can't
come up with something clever
in the next three hours.

572
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,427
Now. We're doing it now.

573
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,532
Well, who died
and made you boss?
Foreman.

574
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,213
It's Iegal.
He's out of his mind.

575
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,274
Yesterday he was giggling
about a hole in a guy's head.

576
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,752
Then hire a Iawyer
and challenge it. In the
meantime, Cameron's in charge.

577
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,756
Why would he sign that?

578
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,519
It's nothing personal,
Mr. Foreman.

579
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,756
My son doesn't trust me.
How exactly
is that not personal?

580
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,292
I'm sorry.

581
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,767
You're sorry?
You're talking about
this man's son!

582
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,098
You're denying him
the right to be a part...

583
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,637
Oh, shut up, House.

584
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,299
If you want to do the biopsy,
do the biopsy.

585
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,571
If House tries to interfere,
Iet me know
and I will take care of it.

586
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,010
Yeah, you're a hero.

587
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,483
If it wasn't for you, we'd be
cutting into a dead guy's head
instead of Foreman's.

588
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,414
Sorry.

589
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,619
Thanks.

590
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,625
That was great!
It was rude and unnecessary.

591
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,720
Yeah.
Go away.

592
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,425
Give me time.
We're out of time.

593
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,866
An hour.
What does "out of time" mean?

594
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,903
His O2 sats
are at 94 right now.

595
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,769
As Iong as they're above 90,
danger of fatal arrhythmia
doesn't increase.

596
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,104
So what?
There's no point in waiting.

597
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,940
You were right.
We should be cutting into
a corpse's head.

598
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,243
Yeah, we should be,
except the CDC's
got the cop's body under...

599
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,044
There's got to be
other bodies.

600
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,210
You think this thing
has killed other people?

601
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,378
No.

602
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,549
That apartment was a dump.

603
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:03,185
Just because Steve McQueen
didn't get sick doesn't mean
some other vermin didn't.

604
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,922
You give me an hour,
I go back there,

605
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,523
I find a dead animal,
I cut its head open
instead of Foreman's.

606
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,364
Foreman's already on
100% oxygen.

607
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,271
Once his O2 sats hit 90,
I can't wait any Ionger.

608
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,676
Where's your suit?

609
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,675
Either you'II find the answer
or I'II find the answer.
It doesn't matter.

610
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,219
CHASE: Prep the drill.
We've got to be ready
to go if we get the signal.

611
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:09,915
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

612
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,886
Ninety-two.

613
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,624
I found a blind bird.

614
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,928
Great. How fast
can you get it in here?

615
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,264
I'II know in about 30 seconds.

616
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,881
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

617
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,977
You better have the bird.
The surgical team's in place.

618
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,455
I screwed up.
How can you not capture
a blind bird?

619
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,891
That's not what I meant.
I screwed up the first time
through this place.

620
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,725
Foreman told you
everywhere he went.
It's not "where, " it's "when. "

621
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,822
He came here early afternoon.

622
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,335
Me and Steve came through
two hours too Iate.
You were six hours early.

623
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,530
It's the water.
The irrigation system
only pumps at...

624
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,369
House! I tested the water!
The water's clean.

625
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,791
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

626
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,201
House.
We tested the wrong water.

627
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:38,264
He stole cable,
he stole fertilizer
and he stole water.

628
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:41,436
It's riddled with Naegleria.
I know.

629
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,810
You already did the biopsy.

630
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,774
I thought I had no choice.

631
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,897
How's my son?

632
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,365
He has primary
amoebic meningoencephalitis.

633
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,399
It's a parasite
that goes through the nose

634
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,738
and migrates into the brain,
where it feeds on brain cells.

635
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:17,103
The Legionella attacked
the parasite. That's why
the disease slowed down.

636
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,846
Is it treatable?

637
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,210
We started him
on an antiparasitic

638
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,845
and the amoebas
will clear out of his system.

639
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,623
And he'II be okay?

640
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,727
Then we'II wean him
out of the coma...

641
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,387
Will he be okay?

642
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,799
There'II be no Iasting damage
from the parasite.

643
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,330
But the surgery?

644
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,840
We don't know.

645
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,685
Up and at 'em.

646
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,082
How you feeling?

647
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,551
Can you talk?

648
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,962
I don't feel anything.

649
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,363
Are you numb?

650
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,303
No, I mean,

651
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,466
I don't feel any pain.

652
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,637
Keep your head still.
Follow my finger.

653
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,218
I'm okay.
Your breath stinks,

654
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,348
and you're peeing into a bag.
What are our names?

655
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,327
You did the biopsy?

656
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,196
Thank you.
Names?

657
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,494
Cameron,

658
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,765
my dad

659
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,264
and the manipulative bastard.

660
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,637
You remembered.

661
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,200
(LAUGHS)

662
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,006
How you doing, Dad?

663
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,102
Great.

664
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,582
Relieved. Great.

665
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,307
What did I have?

666
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,255
Naegleria.
Biopsy showed the amoeba,

667
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,450
the CDC autopsy
eventually found the amoeba,

668
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,358
and House found it
in the water
on the cop's roof.

669
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,656
Wiggle your Ieft toes.
Wait. What?

670
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,430
You went back
and she did the biopsy?
Your Ieft toes, Foreman.

671
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,902
I just did.

672
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,531
No, you didn't.

673
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,309
He can't move his toes.

674
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,143
He can move them.
Raise your right arm.

675
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,613
What?
