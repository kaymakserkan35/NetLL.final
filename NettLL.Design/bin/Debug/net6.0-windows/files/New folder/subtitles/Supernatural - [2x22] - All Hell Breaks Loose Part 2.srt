1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,050
Back in 1835, Samuel
Colt made a special gun.

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,200
They say this gun can kill anything.

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,500
The Colt is gone, and it
seems pretty damn likely

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,100
That the demon is behind all of this.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Whoops.

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,100
Crossroads are where pacts are made.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,800
In selling your soul, rituals like this,

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,500
You got to put your own
photo into the mix, right?

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
I know all about you, Dean Winchester.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,100
I'm looking for the best and brightest.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,500
I'm Sam. I'm Jake.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
This is a competition.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,300
Only one of you crazy kids

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
Is gonna make it out of here alive.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Unh!

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,900
You're tough, you're
smart, you're well-Trained.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,650
Sam, you're my favorite.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,300
Sam! Dean!

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,600
Sam, look out!

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,100
Unh!

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,300
No!

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,500
Sam!!

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,800
Dean?

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,400
Brought you this back.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
No, thanks. I'm fine.

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
You should eat something.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,300
I said I'm fine.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,400
Dean...

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,500
I hate to bring this up. I really do.

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,100
But don't you think maybe it's time...

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,300
We bury Sam?

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,550
We could maybe...

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
What -- Torch
his corpse?

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,500
Not yet.

36
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,500
I want you to come with me.

37
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm not going anywhere.

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
Dean, please.

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,700
Won't you cut me some slack?

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
I just don't think you
should be alone, that's all.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,500
I got to admit -- I
could use your help.

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,500
Something big
is going down --

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,100
End-Of-The-World
big.

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,450
Well, then let it end!

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
You don't mean that.

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,400
You don't think so?

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,200
Huh?

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
You don't think I've given enough?

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,700
You don't think I've paid enough?

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm done with it.

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,900
All of it.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
And if you know what's good for you,

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
Turn around and get
the hell out of here.

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,500
Go!!

55
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,100
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,900
Please just go.

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,500
You know where I'll be.

59
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Howdy, Jake.

60
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,100
I'm -- I'm
dreaming, aren't I?

61
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
I got a genius on my hands.

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,700
Well, congratulations, Jake.

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,700
You're it --
Last man standing.

64
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,900
The american idol.

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,200
I have to
admit --

66
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,400
You weren't the horse I was betting on,

67
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,200
But still, I got to give it to you.

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,700
Go... to hell.

69
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,800
Been there, done that.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
Everything you
put me through --

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Dragging me to that place,

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
Making me kill those people...

73
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,200
All part of the beauty pageant.

74
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,400
Jake, I needed the
strongest, and that's you.

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,000
Needed me for what?

76
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, I got a laundry list
of tasty things for you.

77
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,000
The only thing I'm gonna do

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,900
Is wake up, hunt you down,

79
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,800
And kill you myself.

80
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,800
You know, others have tried.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
It's not easy.

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,300
Trust me, Jake. You want to
be a good little soldier here.

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,800
And if I'm not?

84
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,100
If you're a bad little soldier,

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,300
Well, that dear old mom of yours,

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
That adorable little sister...

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll make certain that
they both live long enough

88
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
To know the chewy taste

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Of their own intestines.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,300
No, Jake.

91
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm not bluffing.

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,900
What do you want me to do?

93
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,600
Like I said
-- Genius.

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
You know, when
we were little --

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,200
You couldn't have
been more than 5 --

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,100
You just started asking questions.

97
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,700
How come we didn't have a mom?

98
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,100
Why do we always have to move around?

99
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,300
Where'd dad go

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
When he'd take off for days at a time?

101
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
I remember I begged you
-- "Quit asking, Sammy.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Man, you don't want to know."

103
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,000
I just wanted you to be a kid...

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
Just for a little while longer.

105
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,900
I always tried to protect you

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Keep you safe.

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
Dad didn't even have to tell me.

108
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,900
It was just always my
responsibility, you know?

109
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
It's like I had one job...

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,900
I had one job...

111
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
And I screwed it up.

112
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,200
I blew it.

113
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,100
And for that, I'm sorry.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,500
I guess that's what I do.

115
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,100
I let down the people I love.

116
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,600
I let dad down.

117
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,900
And now I guess I'm just
supposed to let you down, too.

118
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,800
How can I?

119
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,900
How am I supposed to live with that?

120
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
What am I supposed to do?

121
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,500
Sammy.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
God.

123
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,700
What am I supposed to do?

124
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,300
What am I supposed to do?!

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,100
Come on, already.

126
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,300
Show your face, you bitch!

127
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,400
Easy, sugar. You'll wake the neighbors.

128
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,900
Dean.

129
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,500
It is so, so good to see you.

130
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
I mean it. Look at you.

131
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,900
Gone and got your family
killed, all alone in the world.

132
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,300
It's too sweet.

133
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,500
Excuse me. You're gonna
have to give me a moment.

134
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,900
Sometimes you got to
stop and smell the roses.

135
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,400
I should send you straight back to hell.

136
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,900
Oh, you should.

137
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,500
But you won't.

138
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,300
And I know why.

139
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

140
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,300
Following in daddy's footsteps,
you want to make a deal.

141
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,800
Little Sammy back
from the dead, and --

142
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Let me guess, you're
offering up your own soul?

143
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,900
There are a hundred other demons
who'd love to get their hands on it.

144
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
And it's all yours.

145
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,800
All you got to do is bring Sam back.

146
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
Give me 10 years.

147
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
10 years, and then you come for me.

148
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
You must be joking.

149
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,100
That's the same deal.You
give everybody else.

150
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
You're not everybody else.

151
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,300
Why would I want to give you anything?

152
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,500
Just keep your gutter soul.
It's too tarnished, anyways.

153
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Nine years.

154
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,400
No.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,100
Eight.

156
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
You keep going, I'll keep saying no.

157
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, five years.

158
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
Five years, and my bill comes due.

159
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,700
That's my last offer --
Five years or no deal.

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Then no deal.

161
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Fine. Fine

162
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,800
Make sure you bury Sam before
he starts stinking up the joint.

163
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,500
Wait.

164
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,400
It's a fire sale, and
everything must go.

165
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
What do I have to do?

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,700
First of all, quit groveling.

167
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,600
Needy guys are such a turnoff.

168
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,400
Look...

169
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,600
I shouldn't be doing this. I
could get in a lot of trouble.

170
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,300
But what can I say? I got
a blind spot for you, Dean.

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're like a...puppy. You're
just too fun to play with.

172
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,300
I'll do it.

173
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,800
You'll bring him back?

174
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,900
I will.

175
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,500
And because I'm such a saint,

176
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
I'll give you one
year and one year only.

177
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But here's the thing.

178
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,800
If you try and welch or weasel
your way out, then the deal is off.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,700
Sam drops dead. He's back
to rotten meat in no time.

180
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,900
So...

181
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Its a better deal
than your dad ever got.

182
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,900
What do you say?

183
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,400
Sammy.

184
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,300
Thank god

185
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Hey.

186
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Ow.

187
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,700
Uh, Dean...

188
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

189
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm just...

190
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,300
I'm just happy to see you
up and around, that's all.

191
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
Come on. Sit down. Okay.

192
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,200
Dean... what happened to me?

193
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,800
Well, what do you remember?

194
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,800
I-I saw you and Bobby, and...

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,900
I felt this pain,
this sharp pain like...

196
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Like, white-Hot, you know, and...

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
Then you started running at me, and...

198
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
That's about it.

199
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,700
Yeah, that -- That kid
stabbed you in the back.

200
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,900
You lost a lot of blood. It
was touch and go for a while.

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,400
But, Dean, you -- You can't
patch up a wound that bad.

202
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,500
No, Bobby could.

203
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,900
Who was that kid,anyway?

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
His name's Jake. Did you get him?

205
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,200
No, he disappeared into the woods.

206
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,700
We got to find him, Dean.

207
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,300
And I swear I'm gonna tear
that son of a bitch apart.

208
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, van damme.

209
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
You just woke up,all right?

210
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,800
Let's get you something to
eat. You want something to eat?

211
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,300
I'm starving. Come on.

212
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,100
And that's when you guys showed up.

213
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,000
That's awful.

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,900
Poor Andy.

215
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,200
The demon said he only wanted
one of us to walk out alive.

216
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
He told you that? Yep.

217
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,600
He appeared in a dream.

218
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
He tell you anything else?

219
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,600
No. No.

220
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,300
That was it. Nothing else.

221
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
You know, what I don't get, Dean,

222
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,700
Is if the demon only wanted one of us,

223
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,500
Then how did Jake and I both get away?

224
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,300
Well, I mean, they left you for dead.

225
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm sure they thought it was over.

226
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,200
Now that yellow eyes has Jake,
what's he gonna do with him?

227
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
I don't know.

228
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,100
But whatever it is, we got to stop him.

229
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,100
Hold on, all right? You
need to get your rest.

230
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,100
We got time.

231
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,100
No, we don't.

232
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,100
Sam, oceans aren't boiling, okay?

233
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,600
Frogs aren't raining from the sky.

234
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
Let's get you your strength back first.

235
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,700
Did you call the Roadhouse?
Do they know anything?

236
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,100
Yeah.

237
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,900
Dean...what is it?

238
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
The Roadhouse burned to the ground.
Ash is dead, probably Ellen --

239
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
A lot of other hunters, too.

240
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Demons?

241
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,400
Yeah, we think so.

242
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,700
We think because ash found something.

243
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,800
What'd he find?

244
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Bobby's working on that right now.

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,400
Well, come on, then. Bobby's
only a few hours away.

246
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.
Sam, stop, damn it.

247
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,400
You almost died in there.
I mean, what would I have --

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,100
You just take care of
yourself for a little bit, huh?

249
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,300
Just for a little bit.

250
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm sorry. No.

251
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Hey, Bobby. Hey, Bobby.

252
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,400
See you up and around.

253
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,900
Yeah, well...

254
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,100
Thanks for patching me up.

255
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,100
Don't mention it.

256
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,300
Well, Sam's better.

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
And we're back in it now, so...

258
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
What do you know?

259
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, I found something,but...

260
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm not sure what the hell it means.

261
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,000
What is it?

262
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,600
Demonic omens...like a frickin' tidal
wave. Cattle deaths,lightning storms.

263
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,400
They skyrocketed from out of nowhere.

264
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,400
Here.

265
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,800
All around here
except for one place --

266
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,800
Southern wyoming.

267
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,800
Wyoming?

268
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,500
Yeah.

269
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,200
That one area's totally
clean -- Spotless.

270
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,900
It's almost as if...

271
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,900
What?

272
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,100
...the demons are surrounding it.

273
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,700
But you don't know why?

274
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,300
No, and by this point,
my eyes are swimming.

275
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,600
Sam, would you take a look at it?

276
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,550
Maybe you can catch
something I couldn't.

277
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Yeah, sure.

278
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,800
Come on, Dean.

279
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,200
I got some more books in the truck.

280
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,800
Help me lug them in.

281
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,600
Yeah.

282
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,700
You stupid ass! What did you do?

283
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
What did you do?!

284
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,100
You made a deal... for Sam, didn't you?

285
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,700
How long did they give you?

286
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Bobby.

287
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,900
How long?!

288
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
One year.

289
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,600
Damn it, Dean.

290
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,000
Which is why we got to find
this yellow-Eyed son of a bitch.

291
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,700
That's why I'm gonna kill him myself.
I got nothing to lose now,right?

292
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,200
I could throttle you!

293
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,400
And send me downstairsahead of schedule?

294
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,600
What is it with you Winchesters, huh?

295
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
You, your dad,

296
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,700
You're both just itching to
throw yourselves down the pit.

297
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,800
That's my point.

298
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,450
Dad brought me back, Bobby. I'm
not even supposed to be here.

299
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,600
At least this way,something good
could come out of it, you know?

300
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
It's like my life can mean something.

301
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,400
What? And it didn't before?

302
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,300
Have you got that low
an opinion of yourself?

303
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
Are you that screwed in the head?!

304
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,900
I couldn't let him die, Bobby.

305
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,500
I couldn't.

306
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,000
He's my brother.

307
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,900
How is your brother gonna feel

308
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,300
When he knows you're going to hell?

309
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,100
How'd you feel when you
knew your dad went for you?

310
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,800
You can't tell him.

311
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,400
You take a shot at me,
whatever you got to do,

312
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,800
But please don't tell him.

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Ellen?

314
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
Ellen. Oh, god.

315
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,500
Bobby, is this really necessary?

316
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
Just a belt of holy
water. Shouldn't hurt.

317
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Whiskey now, if you don't mind.

318
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,900
Ellen, what happened? How'd you get out?

319
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
I wasn't supposed to.

320
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
I was supposed to be in
there with everybody else.

321
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,600
But we ran out of
pretzels, of all things.

322
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,800
It was just dumb luck.

323
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,600
Anyway, that's when ash
called, panic in his voice.

324
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,300
He told me to look in the safe.

325
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Then the call cut out.

326
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,200
By the time I got back,
the flames were sky-High,

327
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,300
And everybody was dead.

328
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,600
I could n't have been
gone more than 15 minutes.

329
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,300
Sorry, Ellen.

330
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,700
A lot of good people died in there.

331
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,200
And I got to live.

332
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,900
Lucky me.

333
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,800
Ellen,you mentioned a safe.

334
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,300
A hidden safe we keep in the basement.

335
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Demons get what was in it?

336
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,800
No.

337
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,600
Wyoming.

338
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,000
What does that mean?

339
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
I don't believe it.

340
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
What? You got something?

341
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,300
A lot more than that.

342
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,600
Each of these x's is an
abandoned frontier church --

343
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,600
All mid-19th century

344
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,500
And all of them built by Samuel Colt.

345
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Samuel Colt --The demon-Killing,
gunmaking Samuel Colt?

346
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,900
Yep. And there's more.

347
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,600
He built private railway lines

348
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,800
Connecting church to church.

349
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,200
It just happens to lay out like this.

350
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,400
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

351
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,900
It's a devil's trap.

352
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,200
A 100-Square-Mile
devil's trap.

353
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,600
That's brilliant. Iron
lines demons can't cross.

354
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,100
I never heard of anything that massive.

355
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
No one has.

356
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,200
After all these years none of the
lines are broken? It still works?

357
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,200
Definitely.

358
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,000
How do you know?

359
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,800
All those omens Bobby found.

360
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,000
That means the demons, they must
be circling and they can't get in.

361
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,500
Yeah, well... they're trying.

362
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,800
Why? What's inside?

363
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,400
That's what I've been looking for,

364
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
And, uh, there's nothing except an old
cowboy cemetery right in the middle.

365
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,100
Well, what's so important
about a cemetery or...

366
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,700
What's Colt trying to protect?

367
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,000
Well, unless...

368
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,200
Unless what?

369
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,100
What if Colt wasn't trying
to keep the demons out?

370
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,900
What if he was trying
to keep something in?

371
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,600
That's a comforting
thought. Yeah, you think?

372
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,400
Could they do it, Bobby?
Could they get inside?

373
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
This thing's so powerful,

374
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,300
You'd practically need
an a-Bomb to destroy it.

375
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
No way a full-Blood demon gets across.

376
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,800
No.

377
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,600
But I know who could.

378
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,500
Howdy, Jake.

379
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,900
So, did you have a nice trip?

380
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm here.

381
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,100
I did what you asked. Now what?

382
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,100
50 miles thataway, there's
a cemetery, a crypt.

383
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
You got to open that for me.

384
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,500
Think you can manage that, sport?

385
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,800
You know what? Screw you
and your freaky orders.

386
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,800
Go do it yourself.

387
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,800
Oh, I can't. I can't
go that way -- Not yet.

388
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Why not?

389
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
I just can't.

390
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,800
But if you're gonna open that crypt
for me, you're gonna need a key.

391
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,200
A gun?

392
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,600
Oh, this isn't just any gun, Jake.

393
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,800
This is the only gun
in the whole universe

394
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,800
That can shoot me dead.

395
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,300
Is that so? Yep.

396
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,900
Here, take it.

397
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh, my.

398
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm shocked at this
unforeseen turn of events.

399
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,800
Go ahead, Jake.Squeeze that
trigger. Be all you can be.

400
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
This will all be over. Your
life can go back to normal.

401
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,800
Of course, the army won't take
you back 'cause you're awol.

402
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,400
But I'm sure you could get your
old job at the factory back.

403
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,700
But then, on the other hand,

404
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,700
The rest of your life and your family's

405
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,700
Could be money and
honey, health and wealth,

406
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,000
Every day is ice-Cream sundae.

407
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
And all you got to do
is this one little thing.

408
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,100
Why me?

409
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,300
Oh, Jake. It's got to be you.

410
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,900
I've been waiting for
you for a very long time.

411
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,100
You're my leader.

412
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,900
You open that crypt, and
you will have your army.

413
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,700
You're talking about
the end of the world.

414
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,400
No, not the end
-- The beginning...

415
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,600
A better world where your
family will be protected.

416
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,000
More than that.

417
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,200
They'll be royalty.

418
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,100
Buddy boy,you have the chance

419
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,100
To get in on the ground floor
of a thrilling opportunity.

420
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,300
What do you say?

421
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
It's your call.

422
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,900
Attababy.

423
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Howdy, Jake.

424
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Wait...

425
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,700
You were dead.I killed you. Yeah?

426
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,900
Well, next time, finish the job.

427
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,100
I did.

428
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,300
I cut clean through
your spinal cord, man.

429
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,100
You can't be alive.

430
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,300
You can't be.

431
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,500
Okay, just take it real easy there, son.

432
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
And if I don't?

433
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,200
Wait and see.

434
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,500
What, you a tough guy all of a sudden?

435
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,800
What are you gonna
do -- Kill me?

436
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,900
It's a thought.

437
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You had your chance. You couldn't.

438
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,000
I won't make that mistake twice.

439
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
What are you smiling
at, you little bitch?

440
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,000
Hey, lady.

441
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Do me a favor.

442
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,900
Put that gun to your head.

443
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,700
See, that ava girl was right.

444
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,700
Once you give in to it,

445
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,700
There's all sorts of new jedi
mind tricks you can learn.

446
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Let her go.

447
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,600
Shoot him.

448
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
You'll be mopping up skull
before you get a shot off.

449
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,200
Everybody, put your guns down.

450
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,700
Except you, sweetheart.

451
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,700
Okay.

452
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,000
Thank you.

453
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,400
Please...don't.

454
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Please.

455
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,200
Oh, no.

456
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,400
Bobby, what is it?

457
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
It's hell.

458
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,500
Take cover
-- Now!

459
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,000
What the hell just happened?!

460
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,100
That's a devil's gate,
a damn door to hell!

461
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,000
Come on! We got to shut that gate!

462
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,600
If the demon gave this to Jake...

463
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,900
Then maybe...

464
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,300
A boy shouldn't play with daddy's guns.

465
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Dean!

466
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,300
I'll get to you in a minute, champ.

467
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm proud of you --
Knew you had it in you.

468
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Sit a spell.

469
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,400
So, Dean...

470
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
I got to thank you.

471
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,300
You see, demons can't resurrect people

472
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,700
Unless a deal is made.

473
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,300
I know, red tape --
It'll make you nuts.

474
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,100
But thanks to you,
Sammy's back in rotation.

475
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,300
Now, I wasn't counting
on that, but I'm glad.

476
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
I liked him better than Jake, anyhow.

477
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,100
Tell
me --

478
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,100
Have you ever heard the expression

479
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,500
"If a deal sounds too good
to be true, it probably is"?

480
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,500
You call that deal good?

481
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,200
It's a better shake
than your dad ever got.

482
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,500
And you never wondered why?

483
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm surprised at you.

484
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,000
I mean...

485
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,600
You saw what your brother
just did to Jake, right?

486
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,000
That was pretty cold,wasn't it?

487
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
How certain are you

488
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,250
That what you brought
back is 100% pure Sam?

489
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,899
You of all people should know

490
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,800
That what's dead should stay dead.

491
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,600
Anyway...

492
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,600
Thanks a bunch.

493
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,300
I knew I kept you alive for some reason.

494
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,200
Until now, anyway.

495
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,000
I couldn't have done it

496
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,200
Without your pathetic, self-Loathing,

497
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,400
Self-Destructive desire

498
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,800
To sacrifice yourself for your family.

499
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,200
Well, check that off the to-Do list.

500
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
You did it.

501
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,600
I didn't do it alone.

502
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,000
Do you think dad really...

503
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Do you think he really
climbed out of hell?

504
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,600
The door was open.

505
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,800
If anyone's stubborn enough to do it...

506
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
It would be him.

507
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,700
Where do you think he is now?

508
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
I don't know.

509
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,400
I kind of can't believe
it, Dean.I mean...

510
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,600
Our whole lives,everything...

511
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Has been prepping for this, and now I...

512
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,300
I kind of don't know what to say.

513
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,900
I do.

514
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,900
That was for our mom...

515
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,700
You son of a bitch.

516
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,900
You know, when Jake saw me...

517
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,000
It was like he saw a ghost.

518
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,400
I mean, hell, you heard him, Dean.

519
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
He said he killed me.

520
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,900
I'm glad he was wrong.

521
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,700
I don't think he was,Dean.

522
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,000
What happened... after I was stabbed?

523
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,800
I already told you. Not everything.

524
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,000
Sam, we just killed the demon.

525
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,800
Can we celebrate for a minute?

526
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,300
Did I die?

527
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh, come on.

528
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,100
Did you sell your soul for
me, like dad did for you?

529
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,100
Come on! No

530
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,400
Tell me the truth.

531
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,600
Dean, tell me the truth.

532
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,600
Sam...

533
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,750
How long do you get?

534
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
One year.

535
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,400
I got one year.

536
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,000
You shouldn't have done that.

537
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
How could you do that?

538
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,300
Don't get mad at me.

539
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Don't you do that.

540
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I had to.

541
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,700
I had to look out for you.

542
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
That's my job.

543
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,900
And what do you think my job is?

544
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,100
What?

545
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,700
You saved my life over and over.

546
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,600
I mean, you sacrifice everything for me.

547
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,400
Don't you think I'd do the same for you?

548
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,500
You're my big brother.

549
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,700
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

550
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,300
And I don't care what it takes.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

551
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,100
Guess I got to save
your ass for a change.

552
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,500
Yeah.

553
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,800
Well...

554
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,700
Yellow-Eyed demon might be dead,

555
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800
But a lot more got through that gate.

556
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
How many, you think?

557
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,200
100, maybe 200.

558
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
It's an army.

559
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,500
He's unleashed an army.

560
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,100
Hope to hell you boys are ready.

561
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,400
'Cause the war has just begun.

562
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,000
Well, then...

563
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,000
We got work to do.
