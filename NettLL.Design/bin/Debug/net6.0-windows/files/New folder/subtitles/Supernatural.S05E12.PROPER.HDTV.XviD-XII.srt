1
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:18,019
Evening barkeep. I would like
to purchase some alcohol, please.

2
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:20,854
Uh-huh. What can I get you?

3
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:23,457
Well, I'm 26, as you can see

4
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,459
from my license.

5
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:28,128
Congratulations. 
What can I get you?

6
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:30,731
A banana daiquiri, my good man.

7
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:34,868
I'm Crystal.

8
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:36,537
What's your name?

9
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,272
- Hi, Crystal.
- I'm Gary.

10
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:40,541
Gary, I don't want to embarrass you,

11
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,975
but you are just...

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,378
you are just a 
stunning-looking man.

13
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,246
I know, right?

14
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:52,086
Ooh! Thanks!

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,621
So, Gary, you having
a good time tonight?

16
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,124
Mm! Thank you
for asking, Crystal.

17
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,660
This is, like, the best night ever.

18
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,997
Do you think we could
make it any better?

19
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,435
Probably. I don't know.

20
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,173
I mean, do you want
to get out of here?

21
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:18,112
Well, I-I kind of like this bar,

22
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,914
and I just ordered this daiquiri.

23
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:23,784
I mean...

24
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,752
Do you want to get out
of here with me?

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,128
Are we talking about sex?

26
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,330
Well, I, uh...

27
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:41,201
Yeah. I suppose we are.

28
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:47,674
Crystal, I would love to
have the sex with you.

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,177
Great.

30
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,012
Then let's go.

31
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,987
Love that jacket on you, by the way.

32
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,988
Thanks.

33
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:03,824
Actually...

34
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:07,528
the whole outfit is new.

35
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:10,531
Season 5 Episode 12
   "Swap Meat"

36
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:25,545
Dean and Sammy Winchester.

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,781
So, how long has it been?

38
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:28,115
The summer before 6th grade.

39
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,617
Mm-hmm. I remember.

40
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,786
You assigned yourself
your own reading list.

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,755
That's right.
I forgot about that.

42
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,626
Your mom happens to be the
best babysitter we ever had.

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,229
Well, when I was a
maid at the Mayflower,

44
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,331
out on the interstate,

45
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:45,600
long before you were even an idea...

46
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:47,301
their daddy used to
pass through town

47
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:48,669
and leave the boys with me

48
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,173
While... he went off to... work.

49
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:54,908
One time, he was
gone for two weeks.

50
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:56,610
- Two weeks?
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,113
Oh, he'd always come limping back.

52
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,048
He loved you boys.

53
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,918
Do you know what
he did all that time?

54
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:07,354
Little Sammy kept trying to tell me.

55
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,423
of course, I didn't believe him.

56
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:10,757
Not at first, anyway.

57
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,863
Katie, our dad, um...

58
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:17,598
happened to be an expert
at getting rid of ghosts,

59
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,000
and now, so are we.

60
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,802
That's why I called them, sweetie,
they can help us.

61
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,806
Sounds like you guys got
yourself a poltergeist.

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,175
Started a month or
two after we moved in.

63
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,178
Yeah, first I-it was, uh,
just bumps and knocks

64
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,313
and, uh, scratches on the walls

65
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,282
and then it started breaking things

66
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,717
and then it attacked Katie?

67
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:39,019
That was two nights ago.

68
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,488
Can you show them, honey?

69
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,495
"murdered Chylde."

70
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,402
Katie...

71
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,237
Everything's gonna be fine.

72
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,772
I promise.

73
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,742
Why don't you guys take
yourselves a little vacation,

74
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,077
and, uh, we'll take care of it.

75
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:06,213
Thank you.

76
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,355
Uh, bacon burger turbo,
large chilli-cheese fry,

77
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,959
uh, and a health-quake salad shake?

78
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:21,528
I know. I know.

79
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:24,498
It's, uh it's not mine.

80
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,685
Oh, you shake it up, baby.

81
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:47,854
You know, poltergeist aside,

82
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,523
Donna looked pretty
good, don't you think?

83
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:50,691
Dude, don't tell me

84
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,859
you've still got the
hots for our babysitter.

85
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:54,061
What? No.

86
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,196
That's weird.

87
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:58,498
I'm just saying that she, you know, she...

88
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,033
She's... she's doing good.

89
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,869
You know, with her husband, her kid.

90
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:05,205
This whole amityville thing being thrown
at them, and they're hanging tough.

91
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,473
Yeah.

92
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,645
You ever think that you'd
want something like that?

93
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,349
Wife, rugrats, the whole nine

94
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,986
No. I mean, not really my thing anymore.

95
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,155
Yeah.

96
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,259
What do you got?

97
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:27,995
Uh, well, that house of theirs,

98
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,663
It's old... really old.

99
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,431
Um, hundreds of years

100
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,634
and I found a legend.
It's unconfirmed, but still...

101
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:34,635
Saying?

102
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,136
Supposedly, in the 1720s,

103
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,971
house was owned by a guy
named Isaiah Pickett.

104
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,773
Legend has it

105
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:43,377
he hung a woman in his
backyard for witchcraft...

106
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,978
a woman named Maggie Briggs.

107
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,980
Okay, so an angry ghost witch?

108
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,415
If it's true.

109
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,251
That still doesn't explain
what "murdered Chylde" means.

110
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,453
No. Or where the bitch is buried.

111
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,856
You know, I mean,
it's a long way back,

112
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,226
but I can see if I can find
something in the town records.

113
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,894
It's worth a shot.

114
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,034
Gary! Curly fries are up!

115
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,035
So, any luck?

116
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,403
Bupkis.

117
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:12,406
Can't even find proof a woman
named Maggie Briggs existed,

118
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,308
much less where she was planted.

119
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:17,144
Alright. Well, we've got a
minute to breathe here

120
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,046
so, let's pick it up first thing.

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,281
Yeah, you bet. See you in a few.

122
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,730
Aah!

123
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,732
What...

124
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:46,306
Who...

125
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:29,180
Yeah, this is Collins
out on route 30.

126
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,647
I think we got him.

127
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,052
Mr. Frankel?

128
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:34,388
Mr. Gary Frankel?

129
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:35,689
Who?

130
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,124
Your family's worried
sick about you, son

131
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:39,426
My... my family?

132
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,828
My... brother called you?

133
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:43,263
Come on. Get in before you freeze solid.

134
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,229
Thanks, uh...

135
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:19,166
but, uh, w-where are we?

136
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
You're home, son.

137
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:24,104
N-no, officer, I-I'm not staying here.

138
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:26,373
Gary! Oh, my god!

139
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:27,541
Gary! Oh, god! Gary!

140
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,909
Oh, hey!

141
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,277
Are you all right?

142
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,778
Oh! Okay. Okay. Okay.

143
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:32,913
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

144
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:35,715
Uh... w-what's going on here

145
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,250
- What do you mean?
- Lady, who are you?

146
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:38,752
Mr. Frankel: Young man, are you drunk?

147
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,521
And who are you?

148
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:43,423
Gary, are you drunk?

149
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,858
Answer your father.

150
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,726
My father?

151
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,363
Look, I...

152
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,472
Who is that?!

153
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,273
Who the hell is that?!

154
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:01,875
He's out of his gourd.

155
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,411
Young man, I'm very surprised at you.

156
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:06,012
Yeah,

157
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,614
tell me about it.

158
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:17,334
Oh, yeah.

159
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,471
Bring it!

160
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,345
Holy crap.

161
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:29,647
Sam.

162
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,215
Where the hell you been, man?

163
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,184
I've been trying to call you for hours.

164
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:36,020
I picked up some food.

165
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:39,824
Bacon burger turbo,
large chilli-cheese fry, right?

166
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,063
Sorry, man. Really.

167
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:48,132
I-I just... I lost track of time.

168
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,967
I didn't mean to freak you out.

169
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,069
Thanks.

170
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:55,473
Don't know why it took you
two hours, but thanks.

171
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,875
Oh, you're gonna want
to eat that on the road.

172
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:59,110
Why?

173
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:01,946
The maid came in, saw that,

174
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,349
and now they're all kind of freaking out.

175
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,219
Why'd you let the maid in?

176
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,687
It just happened.

177
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:12,256
Whatever.

178
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,492
I got to hit the head,
and then we'll take off.

179
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,360
All right. I-I'll be outside.

180
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:46,824
Hey. You ready?

181
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:48,826
Absolutely.

182
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,696
Hey, can I drive?

183
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:04,275
Oh, this is so sweet!

184
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,948
You want to get the lead out,
Andretti? Come on.

185
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:15,653
Reverse.

186
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,221
Reverse!

187
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,830
It's in reverse.

188
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:30,334
I am really, really sorry.

189
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,338
Shut up.

190
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,615
This is Dean's
other, other cell, so

191
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,650
you must know what to do.

192
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,153
Dean, I've called every
phone we've got.

193
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:55,025
Where are you, man?

194
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,394
So...

195
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,363
This is gonna sound crazy...

196
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:03,133
really crazy... but, um...

197
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,801
I think I'm in the wrong body.

198
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:07,304
Could
use a little help here.

199
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:14,711
I-I think I got asthma.

200
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:16,813
Call me back.

201
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,723
Lucky star motel.

202
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:28,893
Hello, uh, could you please
connect me to room 102?

203
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,928
102?

204
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:33,597
Nah, man, those guys checked
out middle of the night.

205
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:36,100
Wait... "guys"? Plural?

206
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:39,069
Yeah... one leather jacket, one sasquatch.

207
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:40,404
they left.

208
00:12:57,556 --> 00:13:00,024
Who are you?

209
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:15,973
Smart kid.

210
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,280
Virgin.

211
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:35,558
Frustrated virgin.

212
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,876
Witchcraft, huh, Gary?

213
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,012
You little satanic bastard.

214
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,715
Gary! Breakfast.

215
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:00,150
Leave me alone.

216
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:02,886
Gary!

217
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:07,257
All right, I'm coming!

218
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:17,668
So, Gary, I'd like to know
what happened last night.

219
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:20,037
So would I. Believe me.

220
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:22,306
I mean, what happened
with the plan, buddy?

221
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,807
The plan?

222
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:26,143
S.A.T.S, M.I.T... The plan.

223
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,946
You want to be an engineer,
you need a full ride.

224
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,982
So, tell me, how does getting
drunk fit with the plan?

225
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,384
Right, yeah.

226
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:36,019
Listen, buddy, no offence,
but at the moment,

227
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:37,621
I couldn't give a rat's
ass about your plan.

228
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:41,125
Excuse me?

229
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:46,063
Uh...

230
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:50,901
Listen, h-have I seemed,
uh, moody lately?

231
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:51,902
Withdrawn?

232
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:52,903
Wow.

233
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:55,639
Any... any occult fixations?

234
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:56,673
What?

235
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,710
Let me guess... I'm amazing at Latin.

236
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:00,978
You have an ear for languages.

237
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:02,246
Hmm.

238
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,281
Um, any of the neighborhood
pets go missing recently?

239
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:05,716
Are you smoking drugs?

240
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,286
Leonard. He is not smoking drugs.

241
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,522
Have any of you seen
me w-w-with a book?

242
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,624
It'd be big and old, uh, leather-bound,

243
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,659
maybe some strange writing on it.

244
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:18,662
Or frankly, I'm probably hiding it.

245
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:20,531
Gary, no!

246
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:21,532
W-what?

247
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:23,133
You're allergic to wheat gluten.

248
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:42,886
Gluten.

249
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,189
- You've seriously sprung a leak.
- What?

250
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,491
If mom and dad ever found
that creepy old book of yours,

251
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:48,926
you'd be grounded for a decade

252
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,427
and you're bringing it up at breakfast?

253
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:51,829
So there is a book.

254
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:55,098
Sydney, where do I keep it?

255
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:58,701
So, uh, where we going, anyway?

256
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,636
To work.

257
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:00,938
The case?

258
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:03,841
Oh, right. Yeah... the case. Of course.

259
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,476
Where, uh, do you want to start?

260
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,245
Well, since you couldn't find
where Maggie Briggs was buried,

261
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,280
now we have to do
an all-day tombstone roll

262
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:11,749
to see if we can dig her up.

263
00:16:11,783 --> 00:16:13,584
Wait. M-Maggie Briggs?

264
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:15,586
You mean, like... like,
the witch Maggie Briggs?

265
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Yeah, Sherlock.

266
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:18,155
Yeah, she's in the basement.

267
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:22,526
Come again? W-what basement?

268
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,994
Isaiah Pickett's house.

269
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:27,364
Okay, there's this legend that
he hung her, but he didn't.

270
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,565
The real truth is...

271
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,868
is that she was carrying
his illegitimate child,

272
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:34,138
and he killed her and then
buried her in the basement.

273
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,473
Her "murdered Chylde."

274
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:38,475
That would explain the scratches.

275
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,643
How do you know all this?

276
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:41,812
Oh, I've done all kinds
of research on it.

277
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:45,682
I mean, you know... Last night.

278
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:47,785
Yeah.

279
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:51,789
Nice work... I guess.

280
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:59,196
Aw, man, turn it up!

281
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,698
Seriously?

282
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,634
Hell yeah!

283
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,537
#you can come back, baby#

284
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:09,706
#rock 'n' roll never forgets#

285
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:15,145
#ooooh, the band's still
playin' it loud and lean#

286
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,182
#listen to the guitar
player makin' it scream#

287
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:20,851
#all you got to do is
just make that scene#

288
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:23,187
Dean! Someone has stolen my body!

289
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:25,422
The guy right next to you is not me!

290
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:28,959
Check your friggin' voice mail. Damn it.

291
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:31,328
Gary?

292
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:32,663
Are you okay?

293
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,298
Yeah, I'm Gary. Uh...

294
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,967
Gary is okay.

295
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:41,038
So we're referring to ourselves
in the third person now?

296
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,240
We heard about last
night. What happened?

297
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,175
Got drunk. No big thing.

298
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,243
Look, uh, what's my locker number?

299
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:48,912
What? Are you...
are you still drunk?

300
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:50,981
Yeah. Yeah. I see, like
three of you right now.

301
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:52,816
Um, so... so, what's
my locker number?

302
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,025
Oh, no, Gary.

303
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:40,364
This is a very, very bad book.

304
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,191
Boo-yah!

305
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:10,994
Master chief is in the house, bizatches!

306
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,495
Are you all right?

307
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,397
Yeah. Fine.

308
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:25,642
Well, I'll be damned.

309
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:28,378
Willow Moss.

310
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,679
Yeah, right. It's, uh,

311
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:32,615
supposed to grow
over witches' graves, right?

312
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,122
Yeah.

313
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,526
Hey, man, I'm really sorry about this.

314
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,261
Sorry about what?

315
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,232
Sam?!

316
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:26,670
You okay?

317
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:28,171
Let's get the hell out of here!

318
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:30,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We still got
to burn the body, you idiot.

319
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:31,875
Come on.

320
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:01,738
Dude...

321
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:04,508
that was sweet!

322
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:16,772
Hey, Gary, wait up!

323
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:18,140
Where are you going?

324
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:19,441
I got something to do.

325
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,709
You're skipping class? You?

326
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:22,811
I'm just...

327
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:25,047
Not feeling like myself, okay?

328
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,882
Well, whatever it is,
we can talk it out, bro.

329
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,983
Come with us.

330
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:30,552
I don't have time. I got to go. I'm sorry.

331
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:33,755
Hey!

332
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:39,794
Trevor!

333
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:41,963
Well, what else was I supposed to do?

334
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:54,475
- Here you go, guys.
- Do me a favor, sweetheart.

335
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,679
Would you bring me a
cheeseburger with extra bacon?

336
00:21:57,713 --> 00:21:59,414
and fry an egg on top of it, would you?

337
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:00,415
Absolutely.

338
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,784
Ooh, that... that sounds good. Ditto.

339
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:04,986
Be right back with your order.

340
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:08,323
Okay, who are you and what
have you done with Sam?

341
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:10,591
W-what do you mean

342
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:15,963
Bacon cheeseburgers now?

343
00:22:15,998 --> 00:22:17,999
I don't know. I eat them, don't I?

344
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:20,802
Anyways, we are celebrating.

345
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:22,770
Yeah, I guess.

346
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:25,073
Another one bites the dust.

347
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:26,441
Nice work today.

348
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,109
You too.

349
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:30,645
I had a, uh, really awesome day, man.

350
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,713
Seriously.

351
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,154
Whoo!

352
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:41,222
Sweet.

353
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:43,491
A really awesome day?

354
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:44,792
Yeah. Why not?

355
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:46,494
It was a random, d-list ghost hunt.

356
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,396
That's... that's awesome to you?

357
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,832
I can't be in a good mood?

358
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:55,136
Yeah, I guess. It's...

359
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,838
No, actually.

360
00:22:56,872 --> 00:22:58,840
It's not really your style, Sam.

361
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:02,343
Well, then, it's a new me.

362
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,645
I mean, come on.
Why shouldn't I be happy?

363
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,648
I've got a gun, I'm getting drunk,

364
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:10,251
and I look like this.

365
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:14,422
I don't know.

366
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:18,292
You ever feel like your whole
future is being decided for you?

367
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:22,764
Uh, yeah, Sam, I feel like that a lot.

368
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,334
No matter how much you fight it,
you can't stop the plan.

369
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:28,202
The stupid, stupid plan.

370
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:30,071
So, I don't know.

371
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:32,073
I guess it's, uh, it's just nice

372
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:35,777
to do a little ass-kicking
for a change, that's all.

373
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:41,883
Uh, you know what? I... I'm drunk.

374
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,386
Sorry. Just... just forget it.

375
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,887
No, no. It's all right.

376
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:47,688
It's, uh...

377
00:23:49,324 --> 00:23:50,625
I'll drink to that.

378
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:57,632
Wow, you know, is it just me,

379
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,600
or are we actually drinking together?

380
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:02,603
We don't do it that often, huh?

381
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:05,373
Yeah, you could say that.

382
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:06,908
Well, we should.

383
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,609
You're a good guy, Dean.

384
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:11,112
Man, you are drunk.

385
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:12,113
Here we go.

386
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,648
Mmm!

387
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:14,816
Thank you.

388
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,817
Enjoy.

389
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:17,718
No, but I mean it.

390
00:24:19,054 --> 00:24:22,223
You really are a good guy.

391
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:27,728
Mmm!

392
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:32,066
The bread alone!

393
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,734
Mmm!

394
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:47,281
Love that jacket on you, by the way.

395
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:48,249
Thanks

396
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:51,118
Actually...

397
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:53,154
The whole outfit is new.

398
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:03,198
We're gonna do it!

399
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:27,822
Hey!

400
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:29,724
What the hell's going on?!

401
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:31,759
You can scream all you want.

402
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:36,264
No one can hear you,
my parents are out of town!

403
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:37,765
Gary.

404
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,933
T. What up?

405
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,167
Where are you?

406
00:25:40,202 --> 00:25:42,103
Uh, I can't really tell you right now,

407
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:43,871
But, man, you wouldn't believe it.

408
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:47,141
Well... Well, where's Dean?

409
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:49,677
Uh, the Cloverleaf
on route 6. Why?

410
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:51,445
You mean you haven't killed him yet?

411
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,580
What?

412
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:54,615
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
W-what do you mean?

413
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,683
Kill Dean?

414
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:57,184
I'm... building up to it.

415
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,519
Look, Gary, we got problems here.

416
00:25:58,554 --> 00:25:59,954
For one...

417
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:03,391
I'm looking at your body right now...

418
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:04,759
with this other dude in it.

419
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:06,060
What?

420
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:07,562
Yeah, he's been in your house

421
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:08,729
he's hanging out
with your parents.

422
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:10,798
Okay, just... calm down.

423
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:13,901
Whatever he says, no one's
gonna believe him, right?

424
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:14,853
I mean, w-we're still good.

425
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,738
Would you just hurry up and kill the son
of a bitch already, would you?

426
00:26:17,773 --> 00:26:19,006
Don't rush me. I'll do it.

427
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,708
Yeah, you better.

428
00:26:23,345 --> 00:26:24,745
Uh... Got to go.

429
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:32,019
Oh, man. I am in way over my head.

430
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,289
I don't think he's gonna do it.

431
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:37,491
Just relax. This is Gary
we're talking about.

432
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,160
What the hell's going on here?

433
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:40,561
How do you know who Dean is?

434
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:42,296
Everybody knows Dean.

435
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:44,332
He's "hell's most wanted."

436
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:46,601
Oh, no.

437
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:48,102
No.

438
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:50,271
Have you idiots been talking to demons?

439
00:26:50,305 --> 00:26:51,505
Oh, right. We're the idiots.

440
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:54,375
You're just kids.

441
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,410
You have no idea what
you're messing with.

442
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:58,746
Well, we know that there's
a price on Dean's head,

443
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,781
and we're the ones
that are gonna collect.

444
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:03,184
What's that supposed to mean?

445
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:06,354
About a month ago,
we were down here...

446
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:07,455
Nora.

447
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:09,690
What? We're not allowed
to talk about him?

448
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:13,728
We were down here,
goofing around with that book.

449
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:16,731
Um, I wouldn't exactly call
praying to our dark overlord

450
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,265
"goofing around."

451
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,233
Don't be a loser, Trev.

452
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:20,468
Yeah, Trev.

453
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:23,771
Anyway, all of a sudden,
the lights flickered

454
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:27,108
and Gary went into
this weird trance.

455
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:30,511
He closed his eyes, picked
up a pencil, and drew this.

456
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:34,548
And you know what's really weird?

457
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,350
Gary can't draw.

458
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:39,353
He said he heard a voice in his head,

459
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:41,622
the demons were putting
out a bounty on this guy.

460
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:43,290
A bounty?

461
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:45,426
Yeah, to, like, every witch or Satanist

462
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,061
across the whole country.

463
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:51,032
But Gary... Gary's the
one who spotted you.

464
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:53,200
And the "freaky Friday" crap?

465
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:54,902
another spell from the book.

466
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:58,039
Gary's idea... go in trojan horse-style.

467
00:27:58,073 --> 00:28:00,241
He's really smart.

468
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:02,376
That is, if he has the
beanbags to go through with it.

469
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:04,245
Listen to me.

470
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,148
You are making a terrible mistake.

471
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:10,117
We're talking about a demon deal...

472
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:11,585
Killing somebody.

473
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,921
This isn't a game.

474
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:17,758
You're crossing a line
you won't come back from.

475
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,527
Believe me.

476
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,466
What?

477
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,968
Nothing. I-I...

478
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:31,672
Nora, don't tell me you're
actually listening to this jerk.

479
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:32,673
I don't know.

480
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,241
M-maybe.

481
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:35,743
I-I mean, what if he has a point?

482
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:37,611
I don't believe this,
first Gary, now you.

483
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:39,413
I can't...

484
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,020
You know what?

485
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,354
Fine.

486
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,090
You want something done right...

487
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:50,257
What, you're gonna...

488
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:52,660
You're gonna go kill
Dean yourself, tough guy?

489
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:53,994
Don't have to.

490
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:55,329
I can do this.

491
00:28:56,998 --> 00:28:59,266
N-no. Y-you can't be serious.

492
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:01,736
I'm calling up one
of these bad boys,

493
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,704
turning these punks
over, and getting paid.

494
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:05,439
Dollar, dollar bills, y'all!

495
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:07,508
I-I really don't think
that that's a good idea.

496
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,510
It's not. It's a very, very bad idea.

497
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:11,445
No one asked you.

498
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,092
You're not Sam.

499
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:00,995
Who the hell are you?

500
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:03,197
Ow!

501
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:05,566
Don't do this.
I'm begging you.

502
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,468
Trevor, I think he's right.

503
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:10,237
Hey, you want to get
into Vassar, don't you?

504
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:12,006
Please! Stop!

505
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,073
Attrahendum eos...

506
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:15,042
You're gonna get us all killed!

507
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:16,911
...Ad ligandum eos pariter

508
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:19,847
Eos coram me!

509
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,154
Maybe I said it wrong.

510
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,790
Nora?

511
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:31,725
No! No, no! Don't touch her!

512
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,726
Nora, you okay?

513
00:30:35,597 --> 00:30:37,298
Oh, yeah

514
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm peachy.

515
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,747
So, what'd you call me here for, Skippy?

516
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:49,515
Unless...

517
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:52,218
It's dinnertime?

518
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:56,088
What? I-I... n-no.

519
00:30:56,123 --> 00:31:00,092
Uh, we have Dean Winchester.

520
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:01,928
You do?

521
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:03,596
Where?

522
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,465
Trevor, keep your mouth shut.

523
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,303
The Cloverleaf Motel over on route 6.

524
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:13,839
Sam?

525
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:17,710
Is that you in there?

526
00:31:22,783 --> 00:31:26,652
Well, aren't you just
98 pounds of nothing.

527
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,855
The kid is a moron.

528
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,892
He doesn't have any
idea where Dean is.

529
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:38,364
So, if Sam's in this body,

530
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,733
Who's in Sam's?

531
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,936
A dangerous warlock.

532
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,908
Named Gary.

533
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:52,078
You mean to tell me
you've got Dean Winchester

534
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:55,348
and Sam Winchester's meat suit?

535
00:31:57,117 --> 00:32:01,420
An empty vessel just
waiting to be filled.

536
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:04,090
And you're handing
them both over to me?

537
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:06,759
Uh, y-yeah. I guess.

538
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:10,096
Well...

539
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,098
I got to hand it to you.

540
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,267
I'm impressed.

541
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:17,837
Thanks.

542
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:18,904
Um...

543
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:23,142
So, if you don't mind my asking...

544
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:25,478
there's a reward?

545
00:32:25,512 --> 00:32:27,013
Sure.

546
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:33,486
My... Undying gratitude

547
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,190
What, are you serious?

548
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,492
Be quiet, you idiot!

549
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:41,494
Consider yourself lucky, kid.

550
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:47,433
Uh, w-wait a minute!

551
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,468
We worked our asses off here,

552
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:52,138
and, uh, I want my reward!

553
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:04,150
Please.

554
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:07,153
Okay.

555
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:09,789
I'm sorry.

556
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,324
You're right.

557
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,260
What can I get you?

558
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,830
Well, h-how about a million bucks?

559
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:20,533
Oh, for god's sake, Trevor,
just shut up and run!

560
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,201
A million doesn't buy
you much these days.

561
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:23,669
Why not make it 10?

562
00:33:23,703 --> 00:33:25,037
Okay, $10 mill.

563
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,072
And I want...

564
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:31,043
I want Mindy Schwartz
to fall in love with me.

565
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:35,514
Love... Money,

566
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:37,183
sticking to the basics.

567
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,885
I can respect that.

568
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,521
But here's my counter.

569
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,172
Yep.

570
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,475
Tastes like moron.

571
00:34:07,181 --> 00:34:09,482
You have 38 messages.

572
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:12,085
This is gonna sound crazy...

573
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,754
Really crazy... but, um, I think
I'm in the wrong body.

574
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:22,929
Dean, the guy right next
to you is not me!

575
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,934
Dean, check your friggin'
voice mail. Damn it.

576
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,873
All right, pal

577
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,942
either you start talking
or I start water-boarding.

578
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:38,911
Oh, my god. Please, don't hurt me.

579
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:40,746
Please! I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry!

580
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,881
Okay. Hey, pull it together, champ.

581
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,250
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

582
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,552
Where's Sam?

583
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:49,021
In my... my friend's basement.

584
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:50,522
His parents are out of town.

585
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:51,523
Parents?

586
00:34:51,558 --> 00:34:53,025
How old are you?

587
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,860
I'm 17.

588
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,128
17?

589
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:05,671
Nora

590
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:10,342
Not at the moment.

591
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,352
Whoo!

592
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:32,064
Damn it!

593
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:40,138
Boy, you earned your
dessert tonight, kiddo.

594
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:44,142
Tell me... what is it you want?

595
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:45,544
Anything.

596
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,779
Anything?

597
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,450
Lay it on me.

598
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,485
I want to be a witch

599
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,854
for real.

600
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:57,689
And really powerful.

601
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,824
Mm. Good choice.

602
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,160
I get it.

603
00:36:01,394 --> 00:36:06,030
No daddy, no M.I.T.

604
00:36:06,065 --> 00:36:08,199
No plan.

605
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,868
You get to be big and strong,

606
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:13,404
and no one can tell you
what to do anymore.

607
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,244
There's just one small formality first,

608
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,248
you got to meet the boss.

609
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,816
The boss?

610
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,985
You know... your satanic majesty,

611
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,255
or whatever the kids are
calling it these days.

612
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,324
The devil?

613
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:33,925
Mm-hmm.

614
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,095
Uh... No.

615
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,563
O-okay.

616
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:38,264
Um...

617
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:40,898
It's okay.

618
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,268
I... Don't really want to bother him.

619
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:46,104
Oh, but he's gonna
want to meet you.

620
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:47,872
Relax.

621
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,774
It'll be easy,

622
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,777
he's just gonna ask you
one little question, and

623
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,179
all you got to do is, say "yes."

624
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,857
And then... you get your reward.

625
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:16,568
Exorcizamus te, omnimundus.

626
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,737
What was that?

627
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:20,773
Uh, n-nothing.

628
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:23,442
Were you trying to exorcise me?!

629
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:25,577
You little piece of crap?!

630
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:32,885
spiritus, omnis satanica potestas.

631
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:40,059
Omnis incursio infernalis adversii.

632
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,927
Omnis congregatio.

633
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:44,596
Et secta diabolica.

634
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:46,932
Ergo, draco maledicte.

635
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:51,470
Ecclesiam tuam securi tibi
facias libertate servire.

636
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:52,638
Te rogamus.

637
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:53,972
Adiós, bitch!

638
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:56,408
Uh, it's "audi nos."

639
00:37:57,477 --> 00:38:02,414
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

640
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,219


641
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,928
Animae domum redeant.

642
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,999
Fas atque nefas instauretur.

643
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:29,805
Potestate et auctoritate, sic fiat.

644
00:38:46,555 --> 00:38:48,222
So, we good?

645
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:50,358
Yeah. We're good.

646
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:52,693
Oh, man, it's nice to be back.

647
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:54,996
Yeah. Awesome.

648
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,365
So...

649
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,400
Gary...

650
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,736
Yeah. I know... my bad.

651
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:04,338
"My bad"?

652
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:08,709
Kid, "my bad" ain't gonna cut it.

653
00:39:08,744 --> 00:39:12,213
See, if you were of voting age...

654
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:13,714
You'd be dead,

655
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:15,650
because we would kill you.

656
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:18,520
So either you straighten
up and fly right

657
00:39:18,854 --> 00:39:20,455
or we will kill you.

658
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,291
Are we clear?

659
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:24,493
Crystal.

660
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:25,694
Good.

661
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:41,876
Crap.

662
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:44,379
Gary, look.

663
00:39:44,413 --> 00:39:46,981
Take it from someone who knows...

664
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:48,716
Chin up, man.

665
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:50,218
Your life ain't that bad.

666
00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:52,086
Uh, you met my parents.

667
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:53,888
Yeah. So what? It's your life.

668
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:56,724
You don't like their plan
for you, tell them to cram it.

669
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:58,793
Rebel a little bit.

670
00:39:58,828 --> 00:40:02,397
In a healthy, non-satanic way, of course.

671
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:11,906
By the way, you know why
Nora's into witchcraft?

672
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:13,241
What do you mean?

673
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:16,377
She doesn't like Satan,
you moron. She likes you.

674
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:18,246
Really?

675
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,281
You... you think?

676
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:21,316
Yeah. I know.

677
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,384
I'm telling you, kid...

678
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:25,086
I wish I had your life.

679
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,188
You do?

680
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:28,489
Thanks.

681
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:31,893
Get out of here.

682
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:42,237
That was a nice thing to say.

683
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:46,975
I totally lied.

684
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,310
Kid's life sucked ass.

685
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:04,492
All that apple-pie,
family crap? It's stressful.

686
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:06,995
Trust me... we didn't
miss a damn thing.

687
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:09,731
Or we don't know
what we're missing.

688
00:41:15,304 --> 00:41:16,871
Hey, come on, man.
Turn it down.

689
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:22,176
Welcome back, kotter.

690
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:23,678
#come back, baby#

691
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:28,416
#rock 'n' roll never forgets#

692
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,285
#said you can come back, baby#

693
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,756
#rock 'n' roll never forgets#

694
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,758
#oh, come back, baby#
