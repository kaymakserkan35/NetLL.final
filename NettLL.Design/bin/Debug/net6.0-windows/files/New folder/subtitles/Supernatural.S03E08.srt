1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,470
Merry Christmas, grandpa.

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, Merry Christmas to you, Stevie.

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,690
Did you bring me any presents?

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,230
Now, why would I want to do that?

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,610
'Cause it's Christmas.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,990
Oh, I thought Santa Claus
brought the presents at Christmas.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,250
You have been a good boy
this year, haven’t you?

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,480
I have, I swear.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,450
Well, then, who knows?
Maybe he'll come.

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,280
Santa!

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,540
Reindeer.

12
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,330
Santa?

13
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,440
Um, my daughter and I were in our beds.

14
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,490
Mike was downstairs decorating the tree.

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,420
I heard a thump on the roof,
and then I-I heard mike scream...

16
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,930
And now I'm talking to the FBI.

17
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,310
And you didn't see any of it?

18
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,300
No, he was...

19
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,020
He was just gone.

20
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,970
The doors were locked?
There was no forced entry?

21
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,080
That's right.

22
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,200
Does anybody else have a key?

23
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,210
My parents.

24
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,130
Where do they live?

25
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,530
Florida.

26
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,360
Thanks for letting me have
a look around, Mrs. Walsh.

27
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,350
I think we, uh, got just
about everything we need.

28
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,230
We're all set.

29
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,620
We'll be in touch.

30
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,090
Agents...

31
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,760
The police said my husband
might have been kidnapped.

32
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,210
Could be.

33
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,730
Then why haven't the
kidnappers called o-Or...

34
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,650
Or demanded a ransom?

35
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,110
It's three days till Christmas.

36
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,780
What am I supposed to tell our daughter?

37
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,970
We're very sorry.

38
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,030
Find anything?

39
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,240
Stockings, mistletoe...

40
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,660
This.

41
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,340
A tooth? Where was this?

42
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,930
In the chimney.

43
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,850
No way a man fits up a
chimney. It's too narrow.

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,720
No way he fits up in one piece.

45
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,430
All right, so, if dad
went up the chimney...

46
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,770
We need to find out what
dragged him up there.

47
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,050
So, was I right?

48
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,460
Is it the serial-killing chimney sweep?

49
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,600
Yep.

50
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,170
It's, uh, it's actually Dick Van Dyke.

51
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,340
Who?

52
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,830
Mary Poppins.
Who's that?

53
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,100
Oh, come on.
Never mind.

54
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,150
It turns out that
Walsh is the second guy...

55
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,260
In town grabbed out of
his house this month.

56
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,200
The other guy get dragged
up the chimney, too?

57
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,980
Don't know. Witnesses said
they heard a thump on the roof.

58
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,500
So, what the hell do you
think we're dealing with?

59
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,770
Actually, I have an idea.

60
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,590
It's, uh, it's gonna sound crazy.

61
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,120
What could you possibly
say that sounds crazy to me?

62
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,920
Evil Santa.

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,500
Yeah, that's crazy.

64
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
I mean, I’m just saying
that there's some...

65
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:37,010
Version of the anti-Claus
in every culture.

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,470
You got Belsnickel, Krampus, Black Peter.

67
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,440
Whatever you want to call it,
there’s all sorts of lore.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,970
Saying what?

69
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,920
Back in the day,
Santa’s brother went rogue...

70
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,450
And now he shows up
around Christmastime.

71
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,680
Instead of bringing presents,
he punishes the wicked.

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,210
By hauling their ass up chimneys?

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,560
For star, yeah.

74
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,440
So, this is your theory, huh?

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,670
Santa's shady brother?

76
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,680
Well, I’m just saying,
that’s what the lore says.

77
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,940
Santa doesn't have a brother.

78
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,920
There is no Santa.

79
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,880
Yeah, I know. You're the one who told
me that in the first place, remember?

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,790
Yeah, you know what?
I could be wrong. I...

81
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,230
Got to be wrong.

82
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,060
Maybe, maybe not.

83
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,180
What?

84
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,700
I did a little digging...

85
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,940
Turns out both victims visited the
same place before they got snatched.

86
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,930
Where?

87
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,160
It does kind of lend credence
to the theory, don’t it?

88
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,690
Yeah, but anti-Claus?

89
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,950
Couldn't be.
It's a Christmas miracle.

90
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,230
Hey, speaking of,
we should have one this year.

91
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,730
Have one what?
A Christmas.

92
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,860
No, thanks.

93
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,060
No, we’ll get a tree, a little Boston market.
Just like when we were little.

94
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,070
Dean, those weren't exactly
hallmark memories for me.

95
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,930
What are you talking about?
We had some great Christmases.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,520
Whose childhood are you talking about?

97
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,700
Oh, come on, Sam.

98
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,790
No, just...

99
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,710
No.

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,890
All right, grinch.

101
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,540
What is that?

102
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,920
A present for dad.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,490
Yeah, right.

104
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,080
Where'd you get the money... Steal it?

105
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,210
No.

106
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,160
Uncle Bobby gave it
to me to give to him.

107
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,730
Said it was real special.

108
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,240
What is it?

109
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,010
A pony.

110
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,140
Very funny.

111
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,640
Dad's gonna be here, right?

112
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,220
He'll be here.

113
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,720
It's Christmas.

114
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,070
He knows.

115
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,950
And he'll be here... Promise.

116
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,400
Where is he, anyway?

117
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,690
On business.

118
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,110
What kind of business?

119
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,870
You know that.

120
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,180
He sells stuff.

121
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,230
What kind of stuff?

122
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,630
Stuff.

123
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,690
Nobody ever tells me anything.

124
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,260
Then quit asking.

125
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,310
Is dad a spy?

126
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,050
He's James Bond.

127
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,560
Why do we move around so much?

128
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,340
'Cause everywhere we go,
they get sick of your face.

129
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,470
I'm old enough, Dean.

130
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,830
You can tell me the truth.

131
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,920
You don't want to know the truth.

132
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,230
Believe me.

133
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,460
Is that why we never talk about...

134
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,470
Mom?

135
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,520
Shut up!

136
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,660
Don't you ever talk about mom... Ever!

137
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,500
Wait. Where are you going?

138
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,370
Out.

139
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,136
You'd think with the 10
bucks it costs to get into...

140
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,690
This place, Santa could
scrounge up a little snow.

141
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,940
What?

142
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,850
Nothing. What are we looking for, again?

143
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,661
Lore says that the anti-Claus will...

144
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,930
Walk with a limp and smell like sweets.

145
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,200
Great. So we're looking
for a pimp Santa.

146
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,290
Why the sweets?

147
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,360
Think about it, Dean. If you smell like...

148
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:30,600
Candy, the kids will
come closer, you know?

149
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,410
That's creepy.

150
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,852
How does this thing know who's...

151
00:08:34,853 --> 00:08:36,430
Been naughty and who's been nice?

152
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,620
I don't know.

153
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,690
So, Ronny, come sit on Santa’s knee.

154
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,390
Ah, there you go.

155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,740
You been a good boy this year?

156
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,330
Good.

157
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,690
Santa's got a special gift for you.

158
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,990
Maybe we do.

159
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,780
Welcome to Santa’s court.

160
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,870
Can I escort your child to Santa?

161
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,370
N- No.

162
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,137
Uh, but, actually, my brother here it's...

163
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,590
Been a lifelong dream of his.

164
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,500
Uh, sorry.

165
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,050
No kids over... 12...

166
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,520
No, he’s just kidding.

167
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,030
We only came here to watch.

168
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,210
I- I didn't mean that we came here to...

169
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,960
Thanks a lot, Dean. Thanks for that.

170
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,110
Check it out.

171
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,810
Are you seeing this?

172
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,580
A lot of people walk with limps, right?

173
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,366
Tell me you didn't smell...

174
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:47,160
That. That was candy, man.

175
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,210
That was ripple... I think. Had to be.

176
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,020
Maybe. We willing to take that chance?

177
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,590
What time is it?

178
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,540
Same as the last time you asked.

179
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,590
Here.

180
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,270
Caffeinate.

181
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,070
Wonderful.

182
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,570
Hey, Sam...

183
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,570
Why are you the boy
that hates Christmas?

184
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,770
Dean...

185
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,517
I mean, I admit it

186
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:31,510
We had a few bumpy
holidays when we were kids.

187
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,300
Bumpy?
That was then.

188
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,500
We'll do it right this year.

189
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,064
Look, Dean, if you want to have...

190
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:38,650
Christmas, knock yourself out.

191
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,290
Just don't involve me.

192
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,490
Oh, yeah, that'd be great...

193
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:47,270
Me and myself making cranberry molds.

194
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,190
What's up with Saint Nicotine?

195
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,320
What?
Nothing.

196
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,110
It's just that, uh...

197
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,017
Well, you know, Mr. Gung Ho Christmas

198
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:22,670
Might have to blow away Santa.

199
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,205
What the hell are you doing here?

200
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,890
I'm really not interested, okay?

201
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,930
Mistle my toe...

202
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,560
Roast my chestnut...

203
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,520
Egg my nog...

204
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,020
Jingle my bells...

205
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:52,460
Silent night Holy... night...

206
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,959
Night all is well all is well all is...

207
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:06,590
Dry bright 'round and
'round the table...

208
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,260
Santa, you’re early!

209
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,950
So, that’s how your son
described the attack?

210
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,930
Santa took daddy up the chimney?

211
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,060
That's what he says, yes.

212
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,170
And where were you?

213
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,650
I was asleep.

214
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,980
And all of a sudden...

215
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,270
I was being dragged
out of bed, screaming.

216
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,460
Did you see the attacker?

217
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,810
It was dark, and he hit me.

218
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,030
He knocked me out.

219
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,880
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

220
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,085
Um, Mrs. Caldwell, where did you get...

221
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,120
That wreath above the fireplace?

222
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,460
Excuse me?

223
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,570
Just curious, you know.

224
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,900
Wreaths, huh?

225
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,730
Sure you didn't want to
ask her about her shoes?

226
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,790
I saw some nice handbags in the foyer.

227
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,330
The walshes'.

228
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,240
Yesterday.

229
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,960
I know... I was just testing you.

230
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,460
All right.

231
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,110
Well, keep looking, would you?

232
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,650
Thanks, Bobby.

233
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,650
Well, we’re not dealing
with the anti-Claus.

234
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,290
What did Bobby say?

235
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,250
Uh, that we're morons.

236
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,160
He also said that it was probably
Meadowsweet in those wreaths.

237
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,610
Amazing.

238
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,930
What the hell is Meadowsweet?

239
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,400
It's pretty rare, and it's probably
the most powerful plant in pagan lore.

240
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,340
Pagan lore?

241
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,050
See, they used Meadowsweet
for human sacrifices.

242
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,320
It was kind of like A...

243
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,720
Chum for their gods.

244
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,330
Gods were drawn to it, and they'd stop by
and snack on whatever was the nearest human.

245
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,020
Why would somebody be using
that for Christmas wreaths?

246
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,470
It's not as crazy as it sounds, Dean.

247
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,610
I mean, pretty much every
Christmas tradition is pagan.

248
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,610
Christmas is Jesus' birthday.

249
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,840
No, Jesus' birthday was
probably in the fall.

250
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,123
It was actually the winter
solstice festival that...

251
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:05,360
Was co-opted by the church
and renamed "Christmas".

252
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,706
But the Yule log, the tree,
even Santa’s red suit...

253
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,510
That's all remnants of pagan worship.

254
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,270
How do you know that?

255
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,700
What are you gonna tell me next?
Easter bunny's Jewish?

256
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,730
So, you think we're
dealing with a pagan god?

257
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,340
Yeah, probably hold nickar,
god of the winter solstice.

258
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,092
And all these Martha Stewart...

259
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:27,680
Wannabes, buying these fancy wreaths...

260
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,663
It's pretty much like
putting a neon sign...

261
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:31,530
On your front door saying, ”Come kill us".

262
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,660
Great.

263
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,559
When you sacrifice to
hold nickar, guess...

264
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,720
What he gives you in return.

265
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,360
Lap dances, hopefully.

266
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,680
Mild weather.

267
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,347
Like no snow in the middle of...

268
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,900
December in the middle of Michigan.

269
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,970
For instance.

270
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,100
Do we know how to kill it yet?

271
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,820
No, Bobby’s working on that right now.

272
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,500
We got to figure out where
they're selling those wreaths.

273
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,600
You think they're
selling them on purpose?

274
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,630
Feeding the victims to this thing?

275
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,630
Let's find out.

276
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,010
Help you boys?

277
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,920
Uh, hope so.

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,350
Uh, we were playing jenga with
the walshes the other night...

279
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,603
And he hasn't shut up since...

280
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:17,850
About this Christmas wreath.

281
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,900
I don't know. You tell him.

282
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,950
Sure.

283
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,980
It was yummy.

284
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,880
I sell a lot of wreaths, guys.

285
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,185
Right, right, but you see, this one...

286
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,470
Would have been really special.

287
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,046
It had, uh, it had, uh, green...

288
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,770
Leaves, um, white buds on it.

289
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,330
It might have been made
of, uh, Meadowsweet?

290
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,620
Well...

291
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,470
Aren't you a fussy one?

292
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,490
He is.

293
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,160
Anyway, I know the one
you're talking about.

294
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,530
I'm all out.

295
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,455
Seems like this
Meadowsweet stuff's rare...

296
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:55,100
And expensive.
Why make wreaths out of it?

297
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,950
Beats me. I didn't make them.

298
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,930
Who did?

299
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,310
Madge Carrigan...
 A local lady.

300
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,830
Said the wreaths were so
special, she gave them for free.

301
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,990
She didn't charge you?

302
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,070
Nope.

303
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,150
Did you sell them for free?

304
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,850
Hell, no. It's Christmas. People
pay a butt load for this crap.

305
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,230
That's the spirit.

306
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,946
How much do you think a...

307
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:15,540
Meadowsweet wreath would cost?

308
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,590
A couple hundred dollars, at least.

309
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,520
This lady's giving them away for free?

310
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,220
What do you think about that?

311
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,580
Well, sounds pretty suspicious.

312
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,521
Remember that wreath dad...

313
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,660
Brought home that one year?

314
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,808
Do you mean the one he stole...

315
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:34,320
From, like, a liquor store?

316
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,760
Yeah, it was a bunch of empty beer cans.

317
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,080
That thing was great.

318
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,818
I bet if I looked
around hard enough, I...

319
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,540
Could probably find one just like it.

320
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,970
All right...

321
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,690
Dude...

322
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,080
What's going on with you?

323
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,040
What?

324
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,395
I mean, since when are
you bing Crosby all of a...

325
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,690
Sudden? Why do you want
to do Christmas so bad?

326
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,550
Why are you so against it?

327
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,240
Were your childhood
memories that traumatic?

328
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,750
No, that has nothing to do with it.

329
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,980
Then what?

330
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,550
I mean, I-I just...
I don't get it.

331
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,810
You haven't talked
about Christmas in years.

332
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,100
This is my last year.

333
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,580
I know.

334
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,380
That's why I can’t.

335
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,000
What do you mean?

336
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,480
I mean I can't just sit around...

337
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,960
Drinking eggnog,
pretending everything's okay...

338
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,360
When I know next
Christmas you'll be dead.

339
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,850
I just can’t.

340
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,830
Thought you went out.

341
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,090
To get you dinner.

342
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,470
Don't forget your vegetables.

343
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,590
I know why you keep a
gun under your pillow.

344
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,250
No, you don’t.

345
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,040
Stay out of my stuff.

346
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,520
And I know why we lay
salt down everywhere we go.

347
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,110
No, you don’t. Shut up.

348
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,860
Where'd you get that? That’s dad's!

349
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,680
He's gonna kick your
ass for reading that.

350
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,260
Are monsters real?

351
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,700
What? You’re crazy.
Tell me.

352
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,228
I swear, if you ever tell dad I...

353
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,380
Told you any of this, I will end you.

354
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,040
Promise.

355
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,451
Well, the first thing
you have to know...

356
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:21,130
Is we have the coolest dad in the world.

357
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,780
He's a superhero.

358
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,240
He is?

359
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,160
Monsters are real.

360
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,470
Dad fights them.

361
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,030
He's fighting them right now.

362
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,803
But dad said the monsters...

363
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:35,710
Under my bed weren't real.

364
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,704
That's 'cause he had...

365
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:39,510
Already checked under there.

366
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,910
But, yeah, they're real.

367
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,990
Almost everything's real.

368
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,970
Is Santa real?

369
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,350
No.

370
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,005
If monsters are real, then they...

371
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:56,050
Could get us. They could get me.

372
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,860
Dad's not gonna let them get you.

373
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,540
But what if they get him?

374
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,460
They aren't gonna get dad.

375
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,600
Dad's, like, the best.

376
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,220
I read in dad's book that they got mom.

377
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,710
It's complicated, Sam.

378
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,120
If they got mom, they can get dad.

379
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,700
And if they get dad, they can get us.

380
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,040
It's not like that.

381
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,040
Okay, dad’s fine.

382
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,010
We're fine.

383
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,210
Trust me.

384
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,430
You okay?

385
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,000
Hey, dad's gonna be
here for Christmas...

386
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,410
Just like he always is.

387
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,930
I just want to go to sleep, okay?

388
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,890
Yeah, okay.

389
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,810
It'll all be better when you wake up.

390
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,840
You'll see.

391
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,470
Promise.

392
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,750
This is where Mrs. Wreath lives, huh?

393
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,730
Can't you just feel the evil pagan vibe?

394
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,440
Yes?

395
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,988
Please tell me you're
the Madge Carrigan...

396
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,310
Who makes the Meadowsweet wreaths.

397
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,970
Why, yes, I am.

398
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,130
Bingo.

399
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,376
Well, we were just
admiring your wreaths...

400
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,440
In Mr. Sylar's place the other day.

401
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,930
You were?

402
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,454
Well, isn’t that Meadowsweet just the...

403
00:23:57,455 --> 00:23:59,110
Finest-Smelling thing you ever smelled?

404
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,790
It sure is.

405
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,710
But the problem is, is
all your wreaths had...

406
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:04,700
Sold out before we got
the chance to buy one.

407
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,260
Oh, fudge!

408
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,480
You wouldn't have another one...

409
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:08,590
That we could buy from you?

410
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,491
No, I’m afraid those were the...

411
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,690
Only ones I had for this season.

412
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,410
Tell me something...

413
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,350
Why did you decide to make
them out of Meadowsweet?

414
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,320
Why, the smell, of course!

415
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,930
I don't think I've ever
smelled anything finer.

416
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,410
Yeah, um, you mentioned that.

417
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,330
What's going on, honey?

418
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,080
Well, just some nice boys
asking about my wreaths, dear.

419
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,420
Oh, the wreaths are fine.

420
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,830
Fine wreaths.

421
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,860
Oh, care for some peanut brittle?

422
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,040
We're okay.

423
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,320
I knew it!

424
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,860
Something was way off with those two.

425
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,830
What'd you find?

426
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,702
The Carrigans lived in
Seattle last year, where...

427
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:48,620
Two abductions took place
right around Christmas.

428
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,160
They moved here in January.

429
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,194
All that Christmas crap
in their house wasn't...

430
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:53,960
Boughs of holly.
It was vervain and mint.

431
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,160
Pagan stuff?

432
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,240
Serious pagan stuff.

433
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,993
So, what, Ozzie and Harriet
are keeping a pagan...

434
00:24:57,994 --> 00:24:59,870
God hidden underneath
their plastic-covered couch?

435
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
I don't know.

436
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,760
We got to check them out.

437
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,880
So, what about Bobby?

438
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,265
He's sure evergreen stakes...

439
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:06,720
Will kill this thing, right?

440
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,010
Yeah, he's sure.

441
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,490
Plastic.

442
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,790
Hey, Dean.

443
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,670
Sam!

444
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,137
Gosh, I wish you boys...

445
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,210
Hadn't come down here.

446
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,820
Dean?

447
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,140
You okay?

448
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,640
Yeah, I think so.

449
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,345
So, I guess we're dealing...

450
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:33,990
With Mr. And Mrs. God.

451
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,110
Nice to know.

452
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,509
Ooh, and here we thought...

453
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,896
You two lazybones were...

454
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:41,670
Gonna sleep straight
through all the fun stuff.

455
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,770
Miss all this?

456
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,920
Nah, we're partiers.

457
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,910
Isn't he a kick in the pants, honey?

458
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,760
You're hunters is what you are.

459
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,490
And you're pagan gods.

460
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,985
So, why don't we just call it...

461
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:52,590
Even and go our separate ways?

462
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,050
So you can bring more
hunters and kill us?

463
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,140
I don't think so!

464
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,379
You should have thought about...

465
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,720
That before snacking on humans.

466
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,350
Oh, now, don't get all wet.

467
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,501
Oh, why, we used to take over...

468
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:04,660
A hundred tributes a year.

469
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,610
And that's a fact.

470
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:11,530
Now what do we take? What, two? Three?

471
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,080
Hardy boys here make five.

472
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,440
Now, that’s not so bad, is it?

473
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,770
You say it like that, you
guys are the Cunningham.

474
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,850
You, mister, better
show us a little respect.

475
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,330
Or what?

476
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,420
You'll eat us?

477
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,470
Not so fast.

478
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,570
There's rituals to be followed first.

479
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,220
Oh, we're just sticklers for ritual.

480
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,518
And you know what kicks...

481
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,580
Off the whole shebang?

482
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,400
Let me guess... Meadowsweet.

483
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,710
Oh, shucks...
You're all out of wreaths.

484
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,997
I guess we'll just have to...

485
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:39,250
Cancel the sacrifice, huh?

486
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,040
Oh, don't be such a gloomy gus.

487
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,360
There.

488
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,080
Don't they just look darling?

489
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,970
Good enough to eat.

490
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,210
All righty-Roo.

491
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,150
Step number two.

492
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,990
Sammy.

493
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,700
D- Don't!

494
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,980
Leave him alone, you son of a bitch!

495
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,840
Hear how they talk to us?

496
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,250
To gods?

497
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,730
Listen, pal, back in the day, we...

498
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:13,140
Were worshiped by millions.

499
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,270
Times have changed!

500
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,380
Tell me about it.

501
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,261
All of a sudden, this Jesus character...

502
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:18,820
Is the hot new thing in town.

503
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,184
All of a sudden, our altars...

504
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,370
Are being burned down...

505
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,377
And we're being hunted...

506
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:23,570
Down like common monsters.

507
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,860
But did we say a peep?

508
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,630
Oh, no, no, no, we did not.

509
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,710
Two millennium.

510
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,970
We kept a low profile.

511
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,070
We got jobs, a mortgage.

512
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,920
We.. What was that word, dear?

513
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,950
We assimilated.

514
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,760
Yeah, we assimilated.

515
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,162
Why, we play bridge on...

516
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:41,620
Tuesdays and Fridays.

517
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,460
We're just like everybody else.

518
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,458
You're not blending in as...

519
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:45,460
Smooth as you think, lady.

520
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,650
This might pinch a bit, dear.

521
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,660
You bitch!

522
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,540
Oh, my goodness me!

523
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,060
Somebody owes a nickel to the swear jar.

524
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,513
Oh, do you know what I say...

525
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:58,050
When I feel like swearing?

526
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,930
Fudge.

527
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
I'll try and remember that!

528
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,190
You boys have no idea how lucky you are.

529
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,098
There was a time when
kids came from miles...

530
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,870
Around just to be sitting where you are.

531
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,280
What do you think
you're doing with those?

532
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,030
You fudging touch me again,
I’ll fudging kill you!

533
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,140
Very good.

534
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,160
No, don’t.

535
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,610
Oh, we've got a winner!

536
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,750
What else, dear?

537
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,250
Well, let’s see.

538
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,500
Uh, fingernail, blood...

539
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,550
Sweet Peter on a popsicle stick.

540
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,580
I forgot the tooth!

541
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,500
Oh, dear!

542
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,050
Merry Christmas, Sam.

543
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,740
Open wide...

544
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,300
And say, "ahh.

545
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,410
Somebody gonna get that?

546
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,030
You should get that.

547
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,760
Come on.

548
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,100
Merry Christmas!

549
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,470
I told you I smelled fruitcake.

550
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,660
You shouldn't have.

551
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,480
Oh, bite your tongue. It's my pleasure.

552
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,630
It looks scrumptious!

553
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,670
Neal and I are going caroling.
You care to join?

554
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,050
You know, we would...

555
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,250
It's my back.
Darn thing's giving me fits.

556
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,340
Oh, well, that's a shame.

557
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,770
Oh, well. Merry Christmas.

558
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,030
And to you, too, dear.

559
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,560
Hey, are we still on
for bridge tomorrow?

560
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,300
With bells on! Yes!

561
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,560
Okay, bye.
Bye-Bye.

562
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,270
Now, where were we?

563
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,028
What do we do no the evergreen...

564
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:22,230
Stake's in the basement!

565
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,250
Well, we need more evergreen, Dean!

566
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,480
I think I just found us some more.

567
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,510
Help me get this.

568
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Go!

569
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,500
Come on!

570
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,950
You little thing...

571
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,190
I loved that tree.

572
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,650
Madge!

573
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,180
Merry Christmas.

574
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,600
Sam, wake up.

575
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,830
Dad was here. Look what he brought.

576
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,080
Dad was here?

577
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,740
Look at this. We made a killing.

578
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,460
Why didn't he try to wake me up?

579
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,050
He tried to, like a thousand times.

580
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,770
He did?

581
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,620
Did I tell you he would
give us Christmas or what?

582
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,830
Go on, dive in.

583
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,390
What is it?

584
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,770
Sapphire Barbie?

585
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,310
Dad probably thinks you're a girl.

586
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,550
Shut up.

587
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,340
Open that one.

588
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,780
Dad never showed, did he?

589
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,620
Yeah, he did, I swear.

590
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,910
Dean...

591
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,790
Where'd you get all this stuff?

592
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,840
Nice house up the block.

593
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,730
I swear I didn't know
they were chick presents.

594
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,140
Look, I’m sure dad would
have been here if he could.

595
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,430
If he's alive.

596
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't say that.

597
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,820
Of course he's alive.

598
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,770
He's dad.

599
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,800
Here.

600
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,260
Take this.

601
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,380
No.

602
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,810
No, that’s for dad.

603
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,400
Dad lied to me.

604
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,430
I want you to have it.

605
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,950
You sure?

606
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,550
I'm sure.

607
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,960
Thank you, Sam. I-I love it.

608
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,320
You get the beer?

609
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,130
What's all this?

610
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,120
What do you think it is?

611
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,230
It's... It's Christmas.

612
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,910
What made you change your mind?

613
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,770
Here, uh...

614
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,530
Try the eggnog.

615
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,650
Let me know if it needs some more kick.

616
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,030
No, we’re good.

617
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,375
Good. Well, uh...

618
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:23,620
Have a seat. Let's do
Christmas stuff or whatever.

619
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,580
All right, first thing's first.

620
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,690
Merry Christmas, Sam...

621
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,420
Where'd you get these?

622
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,070
Someplace special.

623
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,590
The gas mart down the street.

624
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,430
Open them up.

625
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,680
Well, great minds think alike, Dean.

626
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,000
Really?

627
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,500
There you go.

628
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,640
Come on!

629
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,300
Skin mags!

630
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,330
And...

631
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,670
Shaving cream.

632
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,680
You like?

633
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,270
Look at this...
Fuel for me and fuel for my baby.

634
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,900
These are awesome. Thanks.

635
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,280
Good.

636
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,780
Merry Christmas, bro.

637
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,820
Here, Merry Christmas.

638
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,500
Hey, Dean.

639
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,490
Do you feel like watching the game?

640
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,710
Absolutely.

641
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,710
All right.
