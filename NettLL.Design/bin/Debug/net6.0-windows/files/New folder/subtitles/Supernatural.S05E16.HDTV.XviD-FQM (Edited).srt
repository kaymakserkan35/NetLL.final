1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,670
Come on, how many times 
do you two die anyway?

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,860
There is someone besides Michael

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,740
strong enough to take on Lucifer.

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,540
And who's that?

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,510
God.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,300
I'm gonna find god.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,260
What is it you want?

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,080
An amulet.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,110
It burns hot in god's presence.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,170
It'll help me find him.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,250
I got nothing like that.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,970
You don't.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,170
What is it?

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,390
Uncle Bobby gave it to me,
said it was real special.

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,800
Thank you, Sam. I love it.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,540
- May I borrow it?  
- No.

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,320
Dean. Give it to me.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,170
Don't lose it.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,840
Looking for this?

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,600
Mornin'.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,020
Shut up. Hands 
where I can see 'em.

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,180
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,780
Is that you, Roy?

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,410
It is, isn't it?

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,300
Which makes you, Walt.

26
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,540
Hiya, Walt.

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,250
Don't matter.

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,890
Well, is it just me, or do 
you two seem a tad upset?

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,990
You think you can flip 
the switch on the apocalypse

30
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,960
and just walk away, Sam?

31
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,070
Who told you that?

32
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,660
We ain't the only 
hunters after you.

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,510
See you in the next life.

34
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,230
Hear me out. I can explain, okay?

35
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,940
Please.

36
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,830
Stay the hell down.

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,180
Shoot him.

38
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,540
Killing Sam was right, but Dean...

39
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,070
He made us, and we just 
snuffed his brother you idiot.

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,040
You want to spend 
the rest of your life

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,640
knowing Dean Winchesters on your ass?

42
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,670
'cause I don't.

43
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,530
Shoot him.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,440
Go ahead, Roy. Do it.

45
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,960
But I'm gonna warn you...

46
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,610
when I come back...

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,940
I'm gonna be pissed.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,940
Come on!

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,290
Let's get this show on the road.

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,940
Come on, already.

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,940
   Season 5 Episode 16
"Dark Side Of The Moon"

52
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,790
Sammy?

53
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,880
Come on, let's go!

54
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,100
Weird dream.

55
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,910
Got your lighter?

56
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,090
Whoa. I haven't 
seen this in years.

57
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,080
Fire 'em up.

58
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,240
I remember this.

59
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,520
It's 4th of July, 1996.

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,650
Dad would never let 
us do anything like this.

61
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,410
Thanks, Dean. 
This is great.

62
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,430
Fire in the hole!

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,390
Sam?

64
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,030
Dean.

65
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,370
Cass?

66
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,150
Yeah, it's me.

67
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,740
You got to stop poking 
around in my dreams.

68
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,830
I need some "me" time.

69
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,420
Listen to me very closely.

70
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,070
This isn't a dream.

71
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,390
Then what is it?

72
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,940
Deep down, you already know.

73
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,650
I'm dead.

74
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,210
Condolences.

75
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,280
Where am I?

76
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,550
Heaven.

77
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,860
Heaven?

78
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,510
How did I get to heaven?

79
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,500
Please, listen.

80
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,820
This spell, this connection,
it's difficult to maintain.

81
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,340
Wait, I-if I'm in heaven...

82
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,810
then where's Sam?

83
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,250
What do you see?

84
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,380
What do you 
mean, what do I see?

85
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,440
Some people see a tunnel or a river.

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,820
What do you see?

87
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,320
Nothing. M-my dash. I'm 
in my car, I'm on a road.

88
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,290
All right... a road.

89
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,500
For you, it's a road.

90
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,900
Follow it, Dean. You'll find Sam.

91
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,010
Follow...

92
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,790
the road.

93
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,880
Thank you.

94
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,110
So, Sam...

95
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,020
I hear you're new to McKinley.

96
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,980
Um, yes, sir. Two weeks.

97
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,820
Stephanie over here just can't seem

98
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,240
to stop talking about you.

99
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,350
Dad, shut up!

100
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,050
Wow!

101
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,220
Just... wow.

102
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,260
Dean?

103
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,200
What are you doing in my dream?

104
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,210
So, what does your 
father do for a living?

105
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,100
Hmm. You don't say.

106
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,040
Heaven?

107
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,010
Yep.

108
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,550
Okay, how are we in heaven?

109
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,880
All that clean living, I guess.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,670
No, no. Um... okay.

111
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,240
You, I get. Sure.

112
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,840
But me?

113
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,760
Maybe you haven't 
noticed, but, um...

114
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,410
I've... done a few things.

115
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,900
You thought you were 
doing the right thing.

116
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,670
Last I checked, it wasn't 
the road to heaven

117
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,090
that was paved 
with good intentions.

118
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,510
Yeah, well, if this is 
the sky-mall... it sucks.

119
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,550
I mean, where's the triplets 
and the latex, you know?

120
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,090
Come on, a guy has needs.

121
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,710
You know, when you bite dust,

122
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,700
they say your life 
flashes before your eyes.

123
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
Your point?

124
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,850
This house... it's one 
of my memories.

125
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,020
When I woke up, I woke 
up in one of my memories.

126
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,040
The 4th of July that we 
burned down that field.

127
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,800
Well, maybe that's what heaven is,

128
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,120
a place where you 
relive your greatest hits.

129
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,650
Wait... so, playing footsie 
with brace-face in there,

130
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,380
t-that... that's a trophy 
moment for you?

131
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,000
Dean, I was 11 years old.

132
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,180
This was my first 
real Thanks-giving.

133
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,210
What are you talking about? 
We had Thanks-giving every year.

134
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,480
We had a bucket of extra-crispy,

135
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,310
and dad passed out on the couch.

136
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,290
I don't remember this.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,090
Hey!

138
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,440
- We should, uh... 
- Yeah, definitely.

139
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,360
Okay.

140
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,170
Uh, what the hell was that?

141
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,980
I don't know, but we are taking 
the escalator back downstairs.

142
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,270
Cass!

143
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,650
What are you doing?

144
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,750
What's it look like?

145
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,860
Like you've lost your mind.

146
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,600
Cass talked to me before

147
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,300
using this... this, phone 
home, radio thing, so I...

148
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,360
Cass!

149
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,480
I can hear you.

150
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,130
Cass. Hey.

151
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,890
So, uh, so, I found Sam, 
b-but something just happened.

152
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,750
There was this weird beam of light.

153
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,910
Don't go into the light.

154
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,090
Okay, thanks... Caroline.

155
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,940
What was it?

156
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,040
Not what, who.

157
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,320
Zachariah. He's searching for you.

158
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,460
A-and if he finds us?

159
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,910
You can't say, yes to Michael 
and Lucifer if you're dead,

160
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,000
so Zachariah needs to 
return you to your bodies.

161
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,200
Great, problem solved.

162
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,460
No, you don't understand. 
Y-you're behind the wall.

163
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,860
This is a rare opportunity.

164
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,180
For what?

165
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,240
You need to find an angel. 
His name is Joshua.

166
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,470
Hey, man. No offence, but

167
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,260
we are kind of ass-full of angels, okay?

168
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,290
- You find him. 
- I can't.

169
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,870
I can't return to heaven.

170
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,780
So, what's so important about Joshua?

171
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,470
The rumour is, he talks to God.

172
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,600
And, so?

173
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,230
You think maybe, just 
maybe, we should find out

174
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,130
what the hell God has been saying?

175
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,240
Geez. Touchy.

176
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,840
Please. I just need you 
to follow the road.

177
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,260
What road?

178
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,250
It's called the Axis Mundi.

179
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,840
It's a path that runs through heaven.

180
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,110
Different people see 
it as different things.

181
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,040
For you, it's two-lane asphalt.

182
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,980
The road will lead you to the garden.

183
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,510
You'll find Joshua there.

184
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,790
And Joshua... he can take us to God.

185
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,540
The garden.

186
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,770
Please, hurry.

187
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,650
So, w-what do you think?

188
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,990
I think we hit the yellow 
bricks, find this Joshua cat.

189
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,940
Really?

190
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,120
What, you don't?

191
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,530
No. I, uh, I'm just 
surprised you do.

192
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,190
I mean, last I checked, you 
wanted to break God's nose.

193
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,540
Now you think he can help?

194
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,730
He's the only one who can.

195
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,720
I mean, come on, Sam. 
We are royally boned.

196
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,990
So, prayer...

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,690
a last hope of a desperate man.

198
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,170
Wasn't there a street out here?

199
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,880
There was.

200
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,910
Dean?

201
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,520
What are you doing?

202
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,060
Looking for a road.

203
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,150
You... you think 
the road is in a closet?

204
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,490
We're in heaven, Sam. Okay?

205
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,700
Our memories are 
coming true, Cass is on TV.

206
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,240
Finding a road in a 
closet would be pretty much

207
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,260
the most normal thing 
to happen to us today.

208
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,170
What?

209
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,110
I used to have one of these...

210
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,150
when I was a kid.

211
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,340
That was the road?

212
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,990
I guess.

213
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,190
Pretty trippy, right?

214
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,320
Yeah.

215
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,320
More trippy...

216
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,380
um, apparently...

217
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,680
you "Wuv hugz."

218
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,420
Shut up.

219
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,490
Wait a minute. I 
know where we are.

220
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,810
Where?

221
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,330
We're home.

222
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,190
Dean.

223
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,490
Hey, Dean, you hungry?

224
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,150
You want the crusts cut off?

225
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,230
Yeah, I... I'd love that.

226
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,310
Mom?

227
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,310
I guess it's not your memory, Sam.

228
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,550
Sorry.

229
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,010
Dean, uh,

230
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
we should... go.

231
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,370
Keep looking for the road.

232
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,030
I know. Just... just 
give me a minute, okay?

233
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,490
- Dean  
- Sam, please. One minute.

234
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,850
Hello?

235
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,810
No, John.

236
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,670
We're not having 
this conversation again.

237
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,410
Time to think about what?

238
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,800
You've two boys at home.

239
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,610
I remember this.

240
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,560
Mom and dad were fighting,

241
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,250
and then he moved 
out for a couple days.

242
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,240
Dad always said they 
had the perfect marriage.

243
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,400
It wasn't perfect until after she died.

244
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,610
Fine, then don't.

245
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,090
There's nothing more to talk about.

246
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,890
What happens next?

247
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,380
It's okay, Mom.

248
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,800
Dad still loves you.

249
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,200
I love you, too.

250
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,800
I'll never leave you.

251
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,830
You... are my little angel.

252
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,220
How 'bout some pie?

253
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,320
Okay.

254
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,170
What?

255
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,000
I just never realized

256
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,330
how long you've been 
cleaning up dad's messes.

257
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,280
Whatever. Let's keep moving.

258
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,600
I've seen this somewhere before.

259
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,130
Where?

260
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,960
Where are we?

261
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,600
No way.

262
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,550
Bones! Hey, come here!

263
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,390
Come here!

264
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,270
Hey!

265
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,470
Bones?

266
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,710
Yeah. Bones was my dog.

267
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,620
Your... your dog?

268
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,760
Yeah.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,110
Is this Flagstaff?

270
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,480
Yeah.

271
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,760
Hey, boy!

272
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,710
- This is a good memory for you?  
- Yeah!

273
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,160
I mean, I was on my 
own for two weeks.

274
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,390
I lived off of, Funyuns and Mr. Pibb.

275
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,690
Wow.

276
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:16,970
What?

277
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,420
You don't remember, do you?

278
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,170
You ran away on my watch.

279
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,750
I looked everywhere for you.

280
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,990
I thought you were dead,

281
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,610
and when dad came home...

282
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,820
Dean, look... I'm sorry.

283
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,570
I-I never thought about it like that.

284
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,060
Forget it. Let's roll.

285
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Stay.

286
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,830
Bonesy, stay.

287
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,680
What memory is this?

288
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,440
No idea.

289
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,010
All right. Come on.

290
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,650
Dean!

291
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,150
Road, God.

292
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,670
Remember?

293
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,390
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

294
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,430
This...

295
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,270
this is the night you ditched us

296
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,330
for Stanford, isn't it?

297
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,140
This is your idea of heaven?

298
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,540
Wow!

299
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,360
This was, like, one of 
the worst nights of my life.

300
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,750
I can't control this stuff.

301
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,420
Seriously?

302
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,740
This is a happy memory for you?

303
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,530
I don't know. I mean, 
I was on my own.

304
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,800
I finally got away from dad.

305
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,550
Yeah, he wasn't the only 
one you got away from.

306
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,110
Dean, I'm sorry. I-I just...

307
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,430
Oh, I know... y-you 
didn't think of it like that.

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,060
- Dean  
- Come on!

309
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,020
Your heaven is somebody 
else's Thanks-giving, okay?

310
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,800
It's bailing on your family.

311
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,970
What do you want me to say?

312
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,790
Look, man...

313
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,400
I never got the crusts cut off my PB&J.

314
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,360
I...

315
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,300
I-I just don't look at 
family the way you do.

316
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,620
Yeah, but I'm your family.

317
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,370
- I know  
- We're supposed to be a team.

318
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,170
It's supposed to be you and 
me against the world, right?

319
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,340
Dean... it is.

320
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,090
Is it?

321
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,270
Go! Go! Go!

322
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,800
Wow!

323
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,400
Running from angels...

324
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,250
on foot...

325
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,340
in heaven.

326
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,270
With out of the 
box thinking like that,

327
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,030
I'm surprised you boys haven't 
stopped the Apocalypse already.

328
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,370
Guys, what's the problem?

329
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,080
I just want to send you 
back to earth. That's all.

330
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,260
I mean, that is,

331
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,280
after I tear you a 
cosmos of new ones.

332
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,890
You're on my turf now, boys.

333
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,490
and by the time 
I'm through with you,

334
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,440
you're gonna be 
begging to say, "yes."

335
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,110
Guys, come on.

336
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,260
You can run, but you can't run.

337
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,460
Shhh...

338
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,660
Hurry, this way!

339
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,890
Wait... who are you?

340
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,560
Buenos dias, bitches.

341
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,640
Ash?

342
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,180
Welcome to my blue heaven.

343
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,550
My God, the road house.

344
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,310
It even smells the same.

345
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,870
Bud, blood, and beer nuts...

346
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,610
it's the best smell in the world.

347
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,230
How 'bout a cold one?

348
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,350
Up here, no hangover.

349
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,510
So...

350
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,690
I mean, no offence...

351
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,020
how's a dirt-bag like me end 
up in a place like this?

352
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,030
I been saved, man.

353
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,630
I was my congregation's 
number-one snake handler.

354
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,730
A-and you said this was your heaven?

355
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,790
Yep. My own... personal.

356
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,350
And when the angels 
jumped us, we were...

357
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,030
In your heaven.

358
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,170
So there are two heavens?

359
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,680
No, more like 100 billion.

360
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,400
So, no worries.

361
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,050
It'll take them angel boys 
a minute to catch up.

362
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,190
What...

363
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,590
See, you got to stop thinking 
of heaven as one place.

364
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,570
It's more like a butt-load of 
places all crammed together.

365
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,840
Like Disneyland,

366
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,930
except without all the anti-Semitism.

367
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,030
Disneyland?

368
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,430
Yeah, see, you got Winchesterland,

369
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,820
Ashland...

370
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,320
a whole mess of everybody-else-lands.

371
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,720
Put 'em all together... heaven, right?

372
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,970
At the centre of it all 
is the magic kingdom...

373
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,660
The garden.

374
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,420
So everybody gets a 
little slice of paradise?

375
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,420
Pretty much.

376
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,260
Few people share, 
special cases, what not.

377
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,390
What do you mean, "Special"?

378
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,320
Oh, you know, like...

379
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,090
soul mates.

380
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,590
Anyways...

381
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,530
most people can't leave 
their own private Idahos.

382
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,340
But you ain't most people.

383
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,500
Nope. They ain't got my skills.

384
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,420
Hell, I have been all over.

385
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,700
Johnny Cash, Andre the giant...

386
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,360
Einstein.

387
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,910
Sam, that man can 
mix a White Russian.

388
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,990
Hell, the other day, I 
found Mallanaga Vatsyayana.

389
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,550
Who?

390
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,910
Wrote "The Kamasutra."

391
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,000
That boy's heaven... 
oh, sweaty, confusing.

392
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
All this from a guy who 
used to sleep on a pool table.

393
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,440
Yeah, now that I'm 
dead, I'm livin', man...

394
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,520
A whole lot more.

395
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,520
So, how'd you find us?

396
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,080
I rigged up my very own...

397
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,600
holy rollin' police scanner.

398
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,630
That's angels, blabbin' enochian, okay?

399
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
I'm fluent.

400
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,630
I heard that you were up.

401
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,560
Course I had to 
come find you... again.

402
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,210
Again?

403
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,900
This ain't the first 
time you been here.

404
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,940
I mean, you boys die more 
than anyone I have ever met.

405
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,540
Really?

406
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,470
Ah, yeah. You don't remember.

407
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,500
God! Angels... must have 
windexed your brains.

408
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,010
So, uh, I mean, have 
you found anybody else?

409
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,180
Ellen and Jo?

410
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,070
Ellen and Jo are dead?

411
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,040
Uh, yeah. Yeah, a 
few months now.

412
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,950
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,950
Mmm...

414
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,740
Uh, they went down fightin'?

415
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,180
Yeah... to the end.

416
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,720
Yeah, a lot of good it did.

417
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,210
How about our folks?

418
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,560
Been lookin' all over 
for John Winchester.

419
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,250
Mary too.

420
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,670
So far, nada.

421
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,230
I'm sorry.

422
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,560
But, hey, there is somebody

423
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,200
who I know for sure 
wants to jaw with you.

424
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,400
Hold up.

425
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,360
Pamela.

426
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,580
- Nice to see you boys again.
- Woo!

427
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,820
So, this is how you 
get around up here?

428
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,150
Mm. More or less.

429
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,110
It's just awesome to finally 
have an application...

430
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,720
a practical application 
for string theory.

431
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,100
So...

432
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,010
So...

433
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,310
That's for getting me killed.

434
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,570
Yeah.

435
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,910
That's... probably less than I deserve.

436
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,250
If it makes you feel any better,

437
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,370
we got Ash killed too.

438
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm cool with it.

439
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,480
He's cool with it.

440
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,030
So, I mean... are you good?

441
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
I'm good.

442
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,930
Really.

443
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,530
Remember my death scene...

444
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,430
gut-shot, coughing blood?

445
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,220
You told me I was 
going some place better.

446
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,880
- I was lying.  
- You were right.

447
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,150
My heaven... it is one long 
show at the meadowlands.

448
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,960
It's amazing. You should see it.

449
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,550
Yeah.

450
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,690
You don't believe me.

451
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,340
No, I do. I... 
it's just, you know...

452
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,690
spending eternity trapped 
in your own little universe

453
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,230
while the angels run 
the show... that's lonely.

454
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,530
You know, that's... 
that's not nirvana.

455
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,980
That's... The Matrix.

456
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,940
I don't know.

457
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,890
Attic's still better than the basement.

458
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,250
Yeah, but...

459
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,830
you know this place...

460
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,760
it feels real, but it's memorex.

461
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,890
Real is down there.

462
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,710
Yeah, well... close enough.

463
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,700
Look, Dean. I'm happy.

464
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,230
I'm at peace.

465
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,030
What, you trying 
to sell me a time-share?

466
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,420
I mean, what's with the pitch?

467
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,020
I know that Michael

468
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,830
wants to take you 
out for a test drive.

469
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,160
- Pamela 
- Just saying.

470
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,970
What happens if you 
play ball with him...

471
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,090
worst case?

472
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,160
A lot of people die.

473
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,110
And then they come 
here. That really so bad?

474
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,560
Look, maybe...

475
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,270
you don't have to fight it so hard.

476
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,510
That's all I'm trying to say.

477
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,210
Hey?

478
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,880
Found a short cut to the garden.

479
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,720
Oh, yeah!

480
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,760
All-access pass to the magic kingdom.

481
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,790
Good.

482
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,600
Not good?

483
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,370
That Zach fella's gonna 
be watching every

484
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,240
road to the garden.

485
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,040
So watch your ass.

486
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,940
And, Dean...

487
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,840
Yep!

488
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,540
Just how I imagined.

489
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,480
Gentlemen.

490
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,990
I don't mean to be a 
downer or anything, but, uh...

491
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,610
I'm sure I'll see you again soon.

492
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,520
Well, keep a sixer on ice for us.

493
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,890
Yeah.

494
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,540
What the...

495
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,010
Why are we back home?

496
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,940
I don't know.

497
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,130
So, what are we gonna do?

498
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,030
Keep looking for 
the road again, I guess.

499
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,080
Honey, why are you up?

500
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,890
Look, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

501
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,620
I love you... but you're not real.

502
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,260
And we don't have time.

503
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,720
Did you have a nightmare?

504
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,330
Tell me.

505
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,530
I got to go.

506
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,100
Then how about I tell 
you my nightmare, Dean?

507
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,900
The night I burned.

508
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,350
Sammy, let's get out of here.

509
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,750
Don't you walk away from me.

510
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,670
I never loved you.

511
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,090
You were my burden.

512
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,990
I was shackled to you.

513
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,460
Look what it got me.

514
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,010
Dean.

515
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,520
The worst was the smell.

516
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,390
The pain, well...

517
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,930
what can you say about 
your skin bubbling off?

518
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,070
But the smell was so...

519
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,300
you know, for a second,

520
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,560
I thought I left a pot 
roast burning in the oven.

521
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,630
But... it was my meat.

522
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,060
And then finally, I was dead.

523
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,750
The one silver lining...

524
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,820
is that at least I was 
away from you.

525
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,860
Everybody leaves you, 
Dean. You noticed?

526
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,670
Mommy...

527
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,070
Daddy,

528
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,920
even Sam.

529
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,270
You ever ask yourself why?

530
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,950
Maybe it's not them.

531
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,690
Maybe... it's you.

532
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,060
Easy now kitten.

533
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,500
You did this.

534
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,230
And I'm just getting started.

535
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
I mean, guys, did you really think

536
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,550
You could just sneak past 
me into mission control?

537
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,600
You son of a bitch.

538
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,810
You know, I'd say the 
same thing about you, Sam,

539
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,080
but I have actually grown 
quite fond of your mother.

540
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,210
Or, at least the 
blessed memory of her.

541
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,320
I think we're gonna be logging 
a lot of quality time together.

542
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,300
I've discovered she's quite the...

543
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,860
Milf.

544
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,230
You can gloat all 
you want, you dick.

545
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,190
You're still bald.

546
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,730
In heaven, I have six 
wings and four faces,

547
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,940
one of which is a lion.

548
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,870
You see this because you're...

549
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,640
limited.

550
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,890
Let's brass-tack this, shall we?

551
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,690
What, are you're gonna 
ball-gag us until we say "Yes"?

552
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,250
Huh? Yeah, I've heard that tune.

553
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,380
I'm gonna do a lot more than that.

554
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,290
I've cleared my 
schedule. Get him up.

555
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
Let me tell you something.

556
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,270
I was on the fast track once.

557
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,100
Employee of the month, 
every month... forever.

558
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,840
I'd walk these halls, and 
people would avert their eyes!

559
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,370
I had respect!

560
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,950
And then they assigned me you.

561
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,690
Now look at me.

562
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,490
I can't close the deal

563
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,110
on a couple of pathetic, 
flannel-wearing maggots?

564
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,770
Everybody's laughing at me.

565
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,030
And they're right to do it.

566
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,600
So... say yes, don't say yes.

567
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,670
I'm still gonna take 
it out of your asses.

568
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,460
It's personal now, boys.

569
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,140
And the last person in 
the history of creation

570
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,170
you want as your enemy is me.

571
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,980
And I'll tell you why,
Lucifer may be strong,

572
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,040
but I'm...

573
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,850
petty.

574
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,520
I'm gonna be the 
angel on your shoulder

575
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,720
for the rest of eternity.

576
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,010
Excuse me, sir?

577
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,750
I'm in a meeting.

578
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,150
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,470
I need to speak to those two.

580
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,420
Excuse me?

581
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,780
It's a bad time, I know.

582
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,310
But I'm afraid I have to insist.

583
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,600
You don't get to insist Jack squat.

584
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,810
No, you're right.

585
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,480
But the boss does.

586
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,580
His orders.

587
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,820
You're lying.

588
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,850
Wouldn't lie about this.

589
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,890
Look... fire me, if you want.

590
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,430
Sooner or later, he's 
gonna come back home.

591
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,430
And you know how he is 
with that whole "wrath" thing.

592
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:46,440
This is... heaven's garden?

593
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,590
It's nice... ish. I guess.

594
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,090
You see what you want to here.

595
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,220
For some it's God's throne room.

596
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,900
For others it's Eden.

597
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,900
You two, I believe

598
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,120
it's the Cleveland Botanical gardens.

599
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,680
You came here on a field trip.

600
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,290
You're Joshua.

601
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,660
I'm Joshua.

602
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,570
So you talk to God?

603
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,740
Mostly, he talks to me.

604
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,340
Well, umm...

605
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,810
we need to speak to him.

606
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,670
It's important.

607
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,130
- Where is he?  
- On earth.

608
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,940
- Doing what?  
- I don't know.

609
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,480
Do you know where on earth?

610
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,240
No, sorry. We don't 
exactly speak face-to-face.

611
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,140
I'm sorry, I don't get it...

612
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,880
God's not talking to nobody, so...

613
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,620
So why is he talking to me?

614
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,750
I sometimes think it's 
because I can sympathize...

615
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,780
gardener to gardener.

616
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,660
And between us, I 
think he gets lonely.

617
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,650
Well, my heart's breaking for him.

618
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,770
Well, can you... at least get 
him a message for us?

619
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,970
Actually, he has a message for you.

620
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,740
"Back off."

621
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,710
What?

622
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,660
He knows already. Everything 
you want to tell him.

623
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,990
- But...
- He knows what the angels are doing.

624
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:07,560


625
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,340
He knows that the 
Apocalypse has begun.

626
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,600
He just doesn't think it's his problem.

627
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,490
Not his problem?

628
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,190
God saved you already.

629
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,980
He put you on that plane. 
He brought back Castiel.

630
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,270
He granted you 
salvation in heaven.

631
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,780
And after everything 
you've done, too.

632
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,850
It's more than his 
intervened in a long time.

633
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,400
He's finished.

634
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,060
Magic amulet or not,

635
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,760
you won't be able to find him.

636
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,520
But he can stop it. 
He could stop all of it.

637
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,580
I suppose he could, but he won't.

638
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,670
Why not?

639
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,870
Why does he allow 
evil in the first place?

640
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,340
You could drive yourself 
nuts asking questions like that.

641
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,670
So he's just gonna sit back 
and watch the world burn?

642
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,830
I know how important 
this was to you, Dean.

643
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,340
I'm sorry.

644
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,730
Well, forget it.

645
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,350
Just another dead-beat dad

646
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,860
with a bunch of excuses, right?

647
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,550
I'm used to that.

648
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,220
I'll muddle through.

649
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,760
Except you don't know 
if you can this time.

650
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,690
You can't kill the devil.

651
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,180
And you're losing faith...

652
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,140
and yourself, your 
brother, and now this.

653
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,350
God was your last hope.

654
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,960
I just...

655
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,810
I wish I could tell 
you something different.

656
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,980
How do we know 
you're telling the truth?

657
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,130
You think that I would lie?

658
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,250
It's just...

659
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,570
you're not exactly the 
first angel we've met.

660
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,370
I'm rooting for you boys.

661
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,660
I wish I could do 
more to help you. I do.

662
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,640
But... I just trim the hedges.

663
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,080
So, what now?

664
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,670
You go home again.

665
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,660
I'm afraid this time 
won't be like the last.

666
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,990
This time...

667
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,070
God wants you...

668
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,710
to remember.

669
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,350
You all right?

670
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,220
Define "all right."

671
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,440
Maybe...

672
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,530
maybe Joshua was lying.

673
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,750
I don't think he was, Cass.

674
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,200
I'm sorry.

675
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,370
You son of a bitch.

676
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,250
I believed in...

677
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,290
I don't need this anymore.

678
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,720
It's worthless.

679
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,590
Cass. Wait.

680
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,620
We'll find another way.

681
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,450
We can still stop all this, Dean.

682
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,620
How?

683
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,350
I don't know.

684
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,950
But we'll find it.

685
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,490
You and me.

686
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,950
We'll find it.
