No. I did, Sarge. Right when

Ex-Marine thinks
he has Gulf War syndrome.

28

There's no such thing.
So he's been told.

It hasn't stopped
the unexplained fatigue,
rashes and joint pain.

And just so you know,
he's the nephew of a
benefactor I owe a favor,

so you're gonna take this case
whether you like it or not.

Why wouldn't I want
to take the case?

Okay. Well, you're about to.
He's on his way here.

Get your ass up
and get your team together.
You have work to do.

That's amazing.
No, it's not.

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,990
It's not?
I can play the harmonica

make a penny come out of
a child's ear, or any other
orifice for that matter,

42

circumstances can bring two
women to simultaneous ecstasy.

being their agreement

But what I absolutely can not
do is dream about someone
I've never seen before.

46
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,140
Well, just because you don't
understand it doesn't mean
it can't happen.

47
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,700
True. It can't happen
because it can't happen!

48
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,240
Well, maybe you didn't dream
about this guy specifically.

49
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,310
Right. Just some other guy
who looks exactly like him.

50
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,750
No. You imagined
some generic Marine,

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,320
then you placed his face
in the dream after
you saw the picture.

52
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,860
Sort of a coincidence mixed
with a little déja vu.

53
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,460
HOUSE: There's no record
of him ever coming
into the clinic,

54
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,400
so I must've seen him
before somewhere else.

55
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,600
Fine. You've known him
since Cub Scouts.

56
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,870
The more interesting question
isn't what you dreamed,
but why.

57
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,540
I'm guessing you're longing
for either a renewed
relationship with your dad,

58
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,210
or a new relationship
with one of
the Village People.

59
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,250
He was in the Navy,
not the Marines.

60
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,680
I thought your dad
was in the Marines.

61
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,980
The guy in
the Village People.

62
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,680
Actually he's only in the Navy
when they sing <i>In the Navy.</i>

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,920
The rest of the time
he's just in generic fatigue.

64
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,520
What?

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,090
You brought it up!

66
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,300
You didn't flush.
I didn't pee.

67
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,270
Male, 34, just got out
of the Marines
after two years in Iraq.

68
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,740
Admitted complaining
of chronic fatigue,

69
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,310
joint pains,
intermittent rashes
and sore throats.

70
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,150
Thinks he has
Gulf War syndrome.

71
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,550
Why is he here
instead of the VA?

72
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,680
Because he has a rich uncle
Cuddy's trying to
avoid fellating,

73
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,020
who doesn't buy
the VA's diagnosis
of nothingswrongatosis.

74
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,430
The VA's right.

75
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,160
FOREMAN:
There's no such thing
as Gulf War syndrome,

76
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,490
especially in veterans
who've never served
in the Gulf War.

77
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,030
Different war, same place.

78
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,570
CHASE: Whatever was there
in 1990 is still there.

79
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,470
What's there can send you home
in a pine box

80
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,100
but it can't make you
sick three months
after you've gotten home.

81
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,770
What, so thousands of soldiers
are lying about
their symptoms?

82
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,940
You send 700,000 people
on a vacation to Hawaii,

83
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,140
some are gonna come back sick.

84
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,510
Doesn't mean it was
caused by snorkeling.
He's right.

85
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,680
The studies all show
the same pattern of
symptoms in veterans

86
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,120
who were sent to the Gulf
and those who weren't.

87
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,180
That's it?

88
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,660
You believe her but not me?

89
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,560
Stick to your guns, Chase.

90
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,690
Just 'cause there isn't
a single unifying symptom

91
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,390
doesn't mean there isn't
something going on.

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,930
It could just affect
everyone differently.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,160
You think this guy has
Gulf War syndrome?

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,530
Of course not.

95
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,940
He's depressed
and he's looking for
a disability check,

96
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,200
most likely because he's
just realized that knowing
how to barter for sex

97
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,140
in six languages
and open a beer bottle
with your eye socket

98
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,840
are not the most
marketable skills.

99
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,010
Why did you take
this case?

100
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,050
'Cause a good scientist
continually questions

101
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,180
his own theories
and assumptions.

102
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,150
Cuddy's making him.
And now I'm making you.

103
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,190
Do a full physical
and recheck his blood
for HIV, hep C,

104
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,060
malaria, schistosomiasis,
and T strain A. Baumannii,

105
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,220
just to make sure
the VA's dotted their I's.

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,700
And find out
every hospital and clinic
he's ever visited,

107
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,970
every city he's ever lived in
and whether he's
ever been on TV.

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,330
TV?

109
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,530
Problem could be neurological.

110
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,040
Everyone knows
TV rots your brain.

111
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,010
Well, it's usually the worst
on my palms and
the bottom of my feet.

112
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,140
I get these
black dots all over.

113
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,040
I don't see anything.
It comes and goes.

114
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,950
You're sure it's not
just scrapes and bruises.

115
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,420
I know the difference between
a rash and a bruise.

116
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,220
Sometimes it's harder than
you realize to distinguish
between the two.

117
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,030
You obviously exercise.

118
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,660
My problems aren't caused
by my workouts.

119
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,200
But you do work out.

120
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,130
And by the look of you,
pretty strenuously.

121
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,230
That's not usually
the case with patients

122
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,740
whose principal complaint
is chronic fatigue
and joint pain.

123
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,540
I was in the Marines for
12 years. I'm used to
doing PT every day.

124
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,340
Just because I can
push through the pain
doesn't mean it's not there.

125
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,180
CHASE: We're not saying
we don't believe you.

126
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,720
The hell you aren't.

127
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,380
We just need
to be specific about
what exactly the problems are.

128
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,760
I sleep 10 hours a night
but I feel tired all the time.

129
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,820
I constantly get coughs,
rashes, sore throats.

130
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,130
My knees and hips
feel like someone poured
sand in my joints.

131
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
Get these weird tingling
sensations in my legs.

132
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,630
Sometimes they're cold.
Other times, feels
like my blood is boiling.

133
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,070
Specific enough?

134
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,670
Look, I don't care
what you guys call it.

135
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,650
Gulf War syndrome, Iraq fever,
or just crappy sickness X.

136
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,710
I just want someone to
figure out what it is
so they can cure it.

137
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,790
Except for the supposed
pain in his joints,

138
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,560
none of the other symptoms
he's complaining about
are currently evident.

139
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,960
And besides low potassium,
probably caused by him

140
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,660
over-hydrating
after working out.

141
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,030
His blood work's all normal.

142
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,800
Low potassium could also
probably be caused by
the experimental vaccines

143
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,330
and anti-chemical
warfare pills he was given
before he deployed to Iraq.

144
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,170
Not to mention the fact
that whole country
is littered

145
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,870
with hundreds of tons of
radioactive shrapnel from
depleted uranium munitions.

146
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,280
You go to medical school
in France? There's no trace of
uranium in his urine.

147
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,480
And he was given the vaccines
and meds two years ago

148
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,990
without any allergic
or adverse reaction.

149
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,150
Has he ever done
any modeling?

150
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,920
We forgot to ask.

151
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,960
We should send
his urine to
the University of Leicester.

152
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,220
There's a professor there
who's developed

153
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,320
a more advanced
screening technique
for uranium.

154
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,460
If the levels are too low for
us to detect, they're way too
low to cause any damage.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,770
Where are you going?

156
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,700
This way.

157
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,570
You find out about
any television or
other media exposure?

158
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
Do you really care
or are you just trying to
waste hospital resources

159
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,240
to get back at Cuddy
for making you take the case?

160
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,980
Of course, I care.

161
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,210
What a horrible thing to say.

162
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,880
Do a Lexis-Nexis search
and get a copy
of his credit report.

163
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,980
Before or after we tell him to
eat a banana and discharge him
with a psych referral?

164
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,150
I say before.

165
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,090
And I say in between
give him a polysomnogram.

166
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,560
Sleep apnea could cause
chronic fatigue and paranoia.

167
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,430
And find out where he went
to summer camp.

168
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,200
You okay?

169
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,940
Yeah. Just a little too
much coffee this morning.

170
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,940
Were we walking you to
the bathroom?

171
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,170
I wish.

172
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,540
Wilson was just in there.
These guys know
what I'm talking about.

173
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,720
CAMERON: That's his third
REM cycle and his breathing's
completely normal.

174
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,890
There's obviously
nothing wrong with
his sleep pattern.

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,760
CHASE: If it's not the
uranium, it's got to be
some other sort of toxin.

176
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,230
Or nothing at all.

177
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,700
You really think there's
something wrong, or you just
want Foreman to be wrong?

178
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,000
Both.

179
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,560
Well, it's not
his sleep pattern.

180
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,630
If you really think
it's a toxin, you can do
a liver biopsy in the morning.

181
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,010
We can't leave.

182
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,840
If we don't monitor
the whole test, House won't
accept the results.

183
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,970
He'll just make us
do it over.

184
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,380
It doesn't take two doctors
to monitor

185
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,350
what's clearly gonna be
a normal polysomnogram.

186
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,750
Oh, so you want me to stay?

187
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,310
You're the one that thought
there was something wrong.

188
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,190
I never said
it was a sleep disorder.

189
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,950
You wanna flip for it?

190
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,320
(SCOFFS)

191
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,720
Just go.

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,620
Oh, come on. Don't be a baby.

193
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,740
Fine. I'll stay.

194
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,880
You know what we could do?

195
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,610
Here?
Why not?

196
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,710
We're surrounded by
empty rooms with beds in them.

197
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,260
Yeah.
And video cameras, too.

198
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,350
So we turn them off.
Yeah, that's all I need is

199
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,020
House or Foreman
walking in on us.

200
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,690
We have the keys.

201
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,930
No. What if he wakes up?

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,330
All right.

203
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,600
Suit yourself.

204
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,920
(SIGHING)

205
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,290
Damn it.

206
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,840
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

207
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,150
<i>I think there's</i>
<i>a problem in here!</i>

208
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,610
What's wrong?

209
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,250
What do you mean,
"What's wrong?"
You don't smell that?

210
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,520
Nothing smells, John.

211
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,060
Oh, are you kidding me?
It's disgusting.

212
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,990
How long have
you thought... Wait.

213
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,060
Open your mouth.

214
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,730
The smell's not in the room.
It's in your mouth.

215
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,830
What's going on?

216
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,230
Good question.

217
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,640
(PILLS RATTLING)

219
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,270
What?

220
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,950
You were wrong about
the nothingswrongatosis.

221
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,720
You can fake fatigue
and joint pain,

222
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,550
but you can't fake
bacterial vaginosis
in your mouth.

223
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,610
<i>HOUSE.: Where's his mouth been?</i>

224
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,160
Says he hasn't performed
oral sex on anyone
in over a year.

225
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,460
Selfish bastard.

226
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,560
Because he hasn't been with
anyone since his last
girlfriend dumped him

227
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,470
after he deployed to Iraq
the second time.

228
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,800
Selfish bitch.

229
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,240
We've ruled out HIV, diabetes
and any other endocrine
abnormality.

230
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,570
Could be autoimmune.
Sjögren's decreases
salivary flow,

231
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,310
creates a hospitable
home for bacteria.

232
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,070
No. His eyes and tear ducts
are fine.

233
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,480
Who was his last girlfriend?

234
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,710
Yeah, we'll get right on that.

235
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,050
Chronic fatigue, joint pain
and opportunistic infection
spells cancer.

236
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,520
Probably lymphoma.

237
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,720
<i>FOREMAN.:</i>
<i>We should biopsy his tonsilar</i>
<i>and submandibular lymph nodes.</i>

238
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,260
Right about cancer,
wrong about lymphoma.

239
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,630
<i>Unless you're simply hiding</i>
<i>the fact that his lymph</i>
<i>nodes are swollen.</i>

240
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,800
Get Wilson to biopsy
his salivary glands.
He's got parotid cancer.

241
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,240
And see if you can
get to the truth about
who he's been dating.

242
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,800
<i>No way, a Marine goes a year</i>
<i>without getting some blood</i>
<i>on his bayonet.</i>

243
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,780
It's not an STD.
You just said...

244
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,940
Just do it.

245
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,190
The antibiotics should
at least relieve
the infection,

246
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,520
which will reduce the odor
and taste in your mouth.

247
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,180
Not soon enough.

248
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,660
All right.
You're gonna feel
a little burn.

249
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,460
You know I never even dipped?

250
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,960
Chewing tobacco.
Practically everyone
in my unit did it.

251
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,500
But me. I was so paranoid
about cancer.

252
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,100
Well, if it's parotid cancer,
it's very treatable
if diagnosed early.

253
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,940
My mom had cancer,
which is why I know that
diagnosing cancer early

254
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,820
means before
there's any serious symptoms.

255
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,330
Certainly tastes like
a pretty serious symptom,
you know?

256
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,730
We'll know more
after the test.

257
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,000
If he was just trying to
mess with Cuddy
for wasting his time,

258
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,040
this would have stopped as
soon as the patient started
exhibiting actual symptoms.

259
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,630
So the question is,
why is he wasting our time?

260
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,270
Or is he wasting our time?

261
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,400
You think he's got a medical
reason for asking for
the guy's credit report?

262
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,710
I don't.

263
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,010
Where were you two
when the guy woke up?

264
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,850
We just stepped out
for a second.

265
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,650
To do what?

266
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,490
To get a coffee.
We'd been up
most of the night.

267
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,860
He's just pushing to make sure
we have a complete history.

268
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,590
Obviously we're missing
something or
we'd have the answer.

269
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,660
You didn't have any coffee
when you came back.

270
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,330
All right already.
We confess.
You caught us.

271
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,340
We snuck into one of
the sleep lab rooms
to have sex.

272
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,970
We shouldn't have done it
while we were working
and we're sorry.

273
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,770
Now can we move on?

274
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,210
House would do Wilson
before you'd do Chase.

275
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,950
No. You would do
House and Wilson
before I'd do Chase.

276
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,730
Now can we
get back to work.

277
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,230
She did me once.

278
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,660
She was stoned!

279
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,570
Biopsy's inconclusive.

280
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,770
I'm gonna do a sialogram
while we wait for results from
the additional blood work.

281
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,910
No hurry.

282
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,680
Probably nothing we can do
at this point anyway.

283
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,310
As long as
the cancer hasn't spread...

284
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,950
He's spitting stink.
You should focus
on the living.

285
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,890
I need a prescription.

286
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,980
I just wrote you
a prescription.

287
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,530
For Vicodin.
I need alfuzosin.

288
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,350
No, you don't.

289
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,230
You figured out
where you met your Marine?

290
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,390
What?

291
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,970
Oh, that. Haven't really
thought about it.

292
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,630
I can't pee.

293
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,200
You can't remember him,
can you?

294
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,770
I can't pee.

295
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,510
So stop taking the Vicodin.

296
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,670
I want to pee
and not be in pain.

297
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,440
Why don't you go to sleep?

298
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,810
I don't pee when I'm asleep.

299
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,950
Maybe you'll dream about him
again. Maybe he'll give you
an address.

300
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,510
I haven't peed in three days.

301
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,520
I read that REM sleep is
the brain's way of
working out problems.

302
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,490
Very useful.
Did you hear
what I just said?

303
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,720
Yeah. You lied because
you want to avoid talking
about your obsession.

304
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,430
I'm not obsessing.
Why don't you just ask him?

305
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,130
I haven't peed in three days!
You'd be dead.

306
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,190
I'm not counting
intermittent drips.

307
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,430
You'd be in agony.

308
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,840
I passed agony
yesterday around 4:00.

309
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,860
His mother, brother,
uncle and best friend

310
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,450
all confirm he hasn't had
a date in over a year.

311
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,360
Which means it's not an STD.

312
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,660
If you come up with something
medically relevant, page me.

313
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,310
What did you want me
to tell him? The truth?

314
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,010
No. You didn't have
to be so convincing.

315
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,280
Don't worry.
I'll make it up to you.

316
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,180
This is getting
out of control.

317
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,380
Don't pout.

318
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,880
Our patient woke up with
an infection while we were
getting our rocks off.

319
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,530
Do you want to stop?

320
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,830
No.

321
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,490
But I don't want to
get caught, either.

322
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,030
You think I do?

323
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,500
You certainly didn't
go out of your way to
keep the volume down

324
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,730
when we were
in the sleep lab.

325
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,640
I couldn't help that.

326
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,170
Why would I
want to get caught?

327
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,550
Maybe you want to give House
a reason to be jealous.

328
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,040
I'm over House.

329
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,090
All this is, is uncomplicated
sex. Don't try to make it
more than that.

330
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,650
We're not doing it
at work anymore.

331
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,520
Fine.

332
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,200
Wanna go grab some lunch?

333
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,140
I think the pill
is the way to go.

334
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,150
We haven't had
a condom break yet.
Thank God.

335
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,170
But it's bound to happen,
especially the way
we've been doing it.

336
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,850
On a bed of nails?
No.

337
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,920
He's not kinky.
He's just insatiable.

338
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,220
I can barely make it
to any of my morning classes.

339
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,920
You smoke?
No way.

340
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,430
Stop it!

341
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,300
Sorry.

342
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,610
Any history of hypertension,
blood clots, strokes?

343
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,670
Nope. Besides my OCD,
I'm fit as a fiddle.

344
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,580
You have OCD?
Can't you tell?

345
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,090
Any other compulsions
besides drinking massive
amounts of water?

346
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,680
No, that's it.
Thank God.

347
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,950
My therapist says
it could be a lot worse.

348
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,820
You get up in the middle
of the night to drink?

349
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,060
Yeah. Every couple of hours.

350
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,620
Then your therapist
is an idiot.

351
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,930
Unconscious people
don't have OCD.

352
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,370
They can, whoever,
have diabetes insipidus.

353
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,410
That's impossible.
I eat candy all the time.

354
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,100
Different kind of diabetes.
This kind is caused
by banged up pituitary.

355
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,010
You're obviously more of
a lover than a fighter.

356
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,040
I'm guessing either a car
accident or you cracked your
skull on the balance beam.

357
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,010
How'd you know?

358
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,520
Easy. Nice ass. No boobs.
And you've got palms
like a longshoreman.

359
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,650
Wait here.
You need a CAT scan.

360
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,850
Oh, my God...
Don't worry.

361
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,800
Just means you'll be taking
two hormone supplements
instead of one.

362
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,730
<i>(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

363
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,740
Okay, this time
you're gonna feel
a little pressure.

364
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,070
We're injecting
the contrast material.

365
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,110
Could you turn up the music?

366
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,410
Sure.

(VOLUME INCREASING)

368
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,520
Looks pretty good so far.

369
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,850
Still can't hear it that well.

370
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,860

371
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,690
Can you hear it now?

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,690
John?

373
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,030
John!

374
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,940
John, can you hear me?

375
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,140
(DOOR OPENING)

376
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,670
Still no relief?

377
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,340
I got relief.

378
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,210
I just got no pee.

379
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,980
If the pills didn't work,
you may need a catheter.

380
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,420
You didn't come here
to talk to me about my pee.

381
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,120
What's going on?

382
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,590
He's got cancer all right.

383
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,060
But it's not in
his salivary glands.
It's in his brain.

384
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,790
And it's bad.
At least six tumors.
Maybe more.

385
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,270
He lost his hearing.
His sight's probably next.

386
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,070
Death is probably next.

387
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,870
HOUSE: No way he could've
grown all these in a week.

388
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,970
They can't be older.
The VA couldn't have
missed all these.

389
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,520
Maybe they didn't miss them.
Just mixed them up.

390
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,650
Switched his films with
another patient's by mistake.

391
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,090
Maybe.

392
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,190
It'd mean some poor sap's
getting his melon sliced
at the VA for no reason.

393
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,720
And this poor sergeant's
gonna be dead
by the end of the week.

394
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,630
Where've you two been?
CAMERON: Lunch.

395
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,260
Why? What happened?

396
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,670
Wilson's found some
fast-growing, elusive
or magic brain tumors.

397
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,140
What did you find?

398
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,440
Nothing.
He's telling the truth.

399
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,900
About what?
CHASE: About everything.

400
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,640
Where he's lived,
who he's dated.

401
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,050
Besides forgetting to mention
his dad's shin splints,

402
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,380
his granddad's nosebleeds,
and to return
a few rented DVDs,

403
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,360
everything he's told us
has checked out.

404
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,820
You have them
researching your dream?

405
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,590
No. I have them
researching my patient.

406
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,020
You had a dream
about a patient?

407
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,970
This poor guy's brain is
riddled with tumors and you're
checking his credit report?

408
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,470
Come on. I need you guys.

409
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,910
Where are you going?
To do my job.

410
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,470
He's not your patient.

411
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,640
He is now.
Go home and go to sleep.

412
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,880
Maybe you'll dream a cure
to late-stage brain cancer.

413
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,260
How is he?

414
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,230
He's dead.

415
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,790
Oh, God.
At least he will be
in a few days.

416
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,500
Question is why.

417
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,730
The only explanation is that
the VA hospital screwed up.

418
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,830
There was definitely
no mix up.
I had them recheck.

419
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,440
Yes. Why would
a government agency lie
to cover up a mistake

420
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,070
that might have caused
the death of a guy

421
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,210
they'd been trying to kill
for the last two years anyway?

422
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,910
They didn't lie.

423
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,410
Did you just take
two Vicodin?

424
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,550
No. Just an antidepressant.

425
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,820
I was told to
take two every time
you walked into the room.

426
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,800
The VA's scan of his brain.
No tumors.

427
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,410
Yes. This is proof positive
that someone didn't have
tumors in their brain.

428
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,810
You see that bright spot
below his left orbit?

429
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,370
That is a titanium pin
your patient had inserted
20 years ago.

430
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,640
Unless you think the VA
happened to mix up
his scans with someone

431
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,850
who had the exact same pin,
they didn't screw up.

432
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,790
You paged us?

433
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,820
Why didn't you send
his urine to Leicester
like I told you?

434
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,300
Because you told me not to.

435
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,860
Why did you choose that moment
to listen to me?

436
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,930
You think depleted uranium
might have something to
do with his tumors?

437
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,300
Radiation's the only thing
that will make tumors
grow that fast.

438
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,100
High doses of radiation!

439
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,200
Even if he ate
depleted uranium bullets
for breakfast,

440
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,840
he still would've been exposed
to less radiation

441
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,510
than we've given him
in the last two days.

442
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,640
Do it anyway.
And you, call his uncle back.

443
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,450
Find out if he ever brought
his nephew to any hospital
parties or fundraisers.

444
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,990
No. Not until
you give me a reason.

445
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,250
Because I'm your boss?

446
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,620
A rational reason.

447
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,790
Or at least admit
that you don't have one.

448
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,130
I've got a full bladder
and I'm not afraid to use it.

449
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,760
But you are
apparently afraid

450
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,960
of discovering
something you can't
rationally explain...

451
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,300
Shut up!

452
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,240
Do what you're told.

453
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,530
Cuddy and Wilson may not have
to listen to me, but you do.

454
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,870
What the hell
was that all about?

455
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,210
I don't care.

456
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,090
Which is why I didn't feel
the need to ask him
eight personal questions.

457
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,680
I'm over him.

458
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,350
Just making an observation.

459
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,830
WILSON: All right.
Ready whenever you are.

460
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,030
I'm ready.

461
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,700
Wait a minute. Zoom in.

462
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,840
I don't see it.
You sure you got
the right coordinates?

463
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,510
Yeah. She's in
the right place.

464
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,290
Go 10 millimeters
above the AC-PC line
on the Z axis.

465
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,750
TECHNICIAN:
Ten mil above AC-PC on Z.

466
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,580
It's not there anymore.

467
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,320
Are you sure you got
the gantry angle right?

468
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,260
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's not there.

469
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,300
It disappeared.

470
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,270
Six tumors don't
just disappear.

471
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,200
Unless they were
never there to begin with.

472
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,870
The VA didn't screw up.

473
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,410
Maybe someone else did.

474
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,100
Maybe it was
Dr. Self-Righteous.

475
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,840
I saw the tumors.
There was no mix up.

476
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,310
Maybe there's something
wrong with the
portable imager in the OR.

477
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,110
Something that would cause it
to show brain tissue
in perfect detail

478
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,620
but completely miss
neoplastic tissue?

479
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,610
Then they were
never tumors to begin with.

480
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,880
I told you I saw...

481
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,550
Oh, you saw something
that looked like tumors.
We all did. We were all wrong.

482
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,650
Or maybe he doesn't
have cancer.

483
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,360
Maybe he has a brain
infection that's causing
multiple abscesses.

484
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,760
That miraculously healed?

485
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,460
No. They were healed
by the antibiotics

486
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,400
we're giving him for
the vaginosis in his mouth.

487
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,840
If it's an infection,
why didn't it show up
in his blood work?

488
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,900
I don't know yet.

489
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,840
Dr. Wilson,
we have a problem.

490
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,250
What did you do?

491
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,720
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

492
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,770
John...
What did you guys do?

493
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,320
John! Calm down!
We didn't even operate.

494
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,650
Could this be
a regional effect?

495
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,850
I can't move my legs!
ANESTHESIOLOGIST:
It's not the anesthesia.

496
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,620
HOUSE: John! John!

497
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,250
We're gonna figure out
what's wrong with you.

498
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:53,490
But first we need to know
one thing, have you ever

sore throats, rashes,

500
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,370
putrid discharge in the mouth,
multiple abscesses
in the brain,

501
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,040
hearing loss,
and last but not least,
lower limb paralysis.

502
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,050
He's certainly given us
plenty of clues.

503
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,480
It's got to be
some sort of infection.

504
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:15,790
That's miraculously improving
in his brain but getting worse
in his ears and legs?

505
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,160
Could be an infection
and cancer.

506
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,690
A neoplastic syndrome
could depress
his immune system

507
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,320
and cause the other symptoms.

508
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,590
You're basing this theory
on the negative biopsy,

509
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,360
the lymph nodes
that aren't swollen,

510
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,800
or the tumors that were
never there to begin with?

511
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,670
And what are you gonna base
your theory on?

512
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,760
His favorite restaurants?

513
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,600
I was right.

514
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,840
He's excreting depleted
uranium in his urine.

515
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,850
We should start him on
an IV infusion of isotonic
sodium bicarbonate...

516
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,470
It's not depleted uranium.

517
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,710
You're the one...
Who asked for the test

518
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,880
when we were thinking cancer.
We no longer are.

519
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,290
Depleted uranium doesn't just
cause cells to mutate.

520
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,620
It can cause
cell death as well.

521
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,390
Not spinal cord cells.

522
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,860
At least not before the dose
is high enough to kill
all his other cells first.

523
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,590
So you're saying the
radioactive uranium in
his urine is irrelevant.

524
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,640
The sun's radioactive.
The earth is radioactive.

This hospital is filled
with radiation.

526
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,740
The issue is not where it is,
but how much there is,

527
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,040
and what damage
that amount can cause
in someone's spinal cord.

528
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,740
As I've already
stated quite clearly.

check his hearing

533

want us to do nothing?

No. I basically

the uranium out of his system.

00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,020
What's going on?
What did he say?

667
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,530
(HUMMING)

668
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,100
Well, looks like
solving the case
solved your other problem.

669
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,040
There is no medicine
like happiness.
Except maybe laughter.

670
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,270
Or rubber tubes
shoved up your urethra.

671
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,410
You cathed yourself?

672
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,650
It's actually not that bad
after the first, I don't know,
9 or 10 inches.

673
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,550
The cath relieved the spasm.
I'm good as new.

674
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,060
Of course. Just a minor spasm
in a muscle you've been using
multiple times a day

675
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,790
without any problems
for the past 45 years.

676
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,990
Not a major side effect caused
by the overuse of a particular
narcotic painkiller.

677
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,900
Yeah.
That was my thought, too.

678
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,370
So, no reason to think about
cutting back on your use
of that particular pill.

679
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,910
Thank God!

680
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,880
Actually, it was
the triple dose
of the good stuff

681
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,810
that allowed me to
finally get some sleep
and solve the case.

682
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,080
Pills made all my dreams
come true.

683
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,920
You really got the answer
in your sleep?

684
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,680
I got one in my sleep.
The other one
I got in the shower.

685
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,190
I've been thinking about you.

686
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,900
You lied.

687
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,700
I didn't lie.

688
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,710
I simply chose not to share
completely irrelevant facts.

689
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,940
Like the fact that you lied.

690
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,740
No wonder I couldn't
place his face.

691
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,210
You were practically
swallowing it
on the dance floor.

692
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,580
I was not.

693
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,210
Talk about the cool uncle.

694
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,690
He donates the money
and the nephew
gets the write-off.

695
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,250
And of course, by write-off,
I mean he gets
to put your ankles...

696
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,390
This is exactly why
I didn't mention our one date
over two years ago.

697
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,620
Because of my T-shirt.

698
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,100
Because you are
an obnoxious ass.

699
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,370
Because you would have
spent the whole time...

700
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,430
That's very smart.

701
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,700
'Cause this way I spent
the whole time completely
focused on the patient.

702
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,170
How did you even
remember him?

703
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,140
We were only at that party
for like 10 minutes!

704
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,910
Is this a new health plan?

705
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,540
Service the Dean of Medicine,
you get free health care
for a year?

706
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,150
Why are you smiling?

707
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,780
You remembered him
because he made out with me.

708
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,820
I'm good with faces.

709
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,760
So this plan,
is it open to anyone?
Is there a co-pay?

710
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,300
You're lousy with faces.

711
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,390
Don't make this about me.
This is your humiliation.

712
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,130
So how much for
private room coverage?

713
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,000
Get over me.

714
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,900
Give me a break.
You hired me...

715
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,600
'Cause you're a good doctor
who couldn't get himself
hired at a blood bank,

716
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,270
so I got you cheap.

717
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,870
You gave me everything
I asked for because one night
I gave you everything...

718
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,180
Stop staring at my ass
when you think
I'm not looking,

719
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,980
showing up at restaurants
where I happen
to be on a date,

720
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,790
and fantasizing about me
in the shower.

721
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,290
That ship sailed
long ago, House.

722
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,330
Get over it.

723
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,700
If you're still referring
to your ass,

724
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,830
I think that supertanker
sailed would be
the more precise metaphor.

725
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,200
Sorry.

726
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,070
Just looking for
an extra-large trashcan.

727
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,610
Since when does
he clean anything up?
