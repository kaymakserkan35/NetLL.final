1
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,800
what's going on?
Oh, my God.

2
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,900
Get a doctor.

3
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
Run!

4
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,100
What happened?
Talk to me.

5
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,100
Dogs.

6
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,600
Stay with us, baby!

7
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,600
Dogs -- Black dogs.

8
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,800
Robert?

9
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,900
Robert,
don't you die on me!

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,100

13
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
so much
for our low profile.

14
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
You got a warrant
in st. Louis,

15
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,900
and now you're officially
in the feds' database.

16
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,200
Du, I'm like dillinger
or something.

17
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,800
Dean, it's not funny.

18
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,700
It makes the job harder.
We got to be more careful now.

19
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,800
Well,
what do they got on <i>you?</i>

20
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,900
I'm sure they just haven't
posted it yet.

21
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
No accessory, nothin
shut up.

22
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,200
[ chuckles ]
You're jealous.

23
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
No, I'm not!
Uh-huh.

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,400
All right, what do you got
on the case there,

25
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,200
you innocent,
harmless young man, you?

26
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
"Architect Sean boyden
plummeted to his death

27
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
"from the roof
of his home --

28
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,900
a condominium he designed."

29
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,800
Build a High-rise
and jump off -- that's classy.

30
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,600
When did he call
animal control?
Two days earlier.

31
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,600
Did he actually say
"Black dog"?
Yeah.

32
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,100
"Vicious, wild, Black dog."

33
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,100
The authorities couldn't find
it, and no one else saw it.

34
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,900
In fact, the authorities
are a little confused

35
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,600
as to how a wild dog
could get past the doorman,

36
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,900
take the elevator up,

37
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
and start roaming the halls
of the cushiest joint in town.

38
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,400
After that, no more calls.
He doesn't show up for work.

39
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,300
Two days later,
he takes a swan dive.

40
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,500
You think we're dealing
with an actual Black dog?

41
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,800
Well, maybe.

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,100
What's the lore on it?
It's all pretty vague.

43
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,300
There are spectral Black dogs
all over the world,

44
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,600
but some say they're animal
spirits, others say death omens.

45
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,700
But anyways, whatever they are,
they're big, nasty...

46
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Yeah, bet they could hump
the crap out of your leg.

47
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,100
Look at that one.
Huh? [ chuckles ]

48
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,100
What? They could.

49
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,400
So, you and Sean boyden
were business partners

50
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,700
for almost 10 years, right?

51
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,800
That's right.

52
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Now, one more time,
this is for...

53
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,400
A tribute for mr. Boyden --
<i>architectural digest.</i>

54
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,200
Funny to you?

55
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,600
No, it --
it's just a tribute.

56
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,100
Yeah.

57
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
See, Sean always got
the tributes.

58
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,900
He kills himself, leaves me
and his family behind,

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,100
but he gets another tribute.

60
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,700
Right.

61
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,100
Any idea why he'd do
such a thing?

62
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,700
I have no clue.
He lived a charmed life.

63
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,300
How so?

64
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,500
He was a flat-out genius.

65
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,200
I mean, I'm capable,
but, next to him, uh...

66
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,100
It wasn't always that way
either.
No?

67
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
You want to know the truth?

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
There was a time where he
uldn't even design a pup tent.

69
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Hell, 10 years ago,
he was working as a bartender

70
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,100
at ts place called lloyd's,
a complete dive.

71
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
So, what changed?
You got me.

72
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,300
But overnight he gets
this huge commission,

73
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,000
and he starts designing --

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
he starts designing
the most ingenious buildings

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,300
anyone has ever seen.

76
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,900
It was like the level
of van gogh and Mozart.

77
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,300
It...
What?

78
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,200
It's funny --
true geniuses,

79
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,800
they seem to die young,
don't they?

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,900
To have that kind of talent,

81
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,200
why...
Why just throw it away?

82
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
So?

83
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,300
The secretary's me is carly.
She's 23.

84
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,800
She kayaks...

85
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
And they're real.

86
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,900
You didn't happen to ask her

87
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
if she's seen any Black dogs,
did you?

88
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Every complaint called in
this week

89
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,300
about anything big, Black,
or doglike.

90
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,000
There's 19 calls in all,

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,400
and, uh, i don't know
what this is.

92
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,700
You mean,
carly's MySpace address?

93
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,200
Yeah, MySpace --
what the hell is that?

94
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,100
Seriously, is that like
some sort of porn site?

95
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
I swear, if this is
another freakin' pomeranian

96
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
barking
in the neighbor's yard...

97
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Afternoon, ma'am.

98
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,800
Uh, animal control.

99
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,500
Oh, someone already came
yesterday.

100
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
Oh, we're just following up.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,900
We're looking
for dr. Sylvia perlman.

102
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
The doctor, well, she --

103
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,500
i don't know exactly
when she'll be back.
She left two days ago.

104
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,300
Okay.
And you are?

105
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,500
I'm miss perlman's maid.

106
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,900
So, where did the doctor go?

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,100
I'm not sure.

108
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,500
She just packed and went.
She didn't say where.

109
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
That stray dog,
did you find it finally?

110
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
Uh, not yet.

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,700
You didn't ever happen to see
the dog yourself, did you?

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,500
Well, no.
I never even heard it.

113
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,200
I was almost starting to think
the doctor was imagining things,

114
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,800
but she's not like that,
so...

115
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,900
You know, i read she was the
chief surgeon at the hospital.

116
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,000
So she's got to be,
what, 42, 43?

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,300
That's pretty young
for that job.

118
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,000
Youngest in the history
of the place.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She got the position
10 years ago.

120
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,000
An overnight success,
10 years ago.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,300
Yeah, we know a guy like that.

122
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,900
Oh, look at this.

123
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,400
Lloyd's bar.

124
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Miss perlman?

125
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,000
I've been calling for hours!

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,900
You need to vacate the room,
or you got to pay for the night!

127
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,900
Okay, no problem.

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,300
Hey.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah?

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
That's weird.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,100
What?
Think someone planted these?

132
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,500
In the middle
of all these weeds?

133
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,300
These are, uh,
what do you call them?

134
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,500
Yarrow flowers?
Yeah.

135
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,600
Used for certain rituals,
aren't they?

136
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,100
Yeah, actually,
summoning rituals.

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,900
So, two people become sudden
successes about 10 years ago,

138
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
right around the time they were
hanging out here at lloyd's.

139
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,100
Where there just happens to be
a crossroads.

140
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,500
You think?
Let's find out.

141
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Seem about the dead center
to you?

142
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,700
Yahtzee.

143
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,000
I'd be willing to bet
that's graveyard dirt.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,700
And a Black cat bone.

145
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,500
That's serious spellwork.

146
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,400
I mean, that's deep South
hoodoo stuff.

147
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,100
Used to summon a demon.

148
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,800
Not just summon one.

149
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,900
Crossroads
are where pacts are made.

150
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,700
These people are actually making
deals with the damned thing.

151
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,500
[ sarcastically ] You know,
'cause that always ends good.

152
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,800
They're seeing dogs,
all right...

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,200
But not Black dogs.

154
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,500
They're seeing hellhounds --
demonic pit bulls.

155
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,600
Whoever this demon is,
it's back and it's collecting.

156
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
And that doctor Lady,
wherever she's running,

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,600
she ain't running
fast enough.

158
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Holy...

159
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Holy?

160
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
I want to play guitar.

161
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,900
I want to be
the best in the world.

162
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,200
If that's what you want.

163
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,900
So...how do we --
do we shake on it?

164
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Sam: So, it's just like the
Robert Johnson legend, right?

165
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,900
I mean, "selling your soul at
the crossroads" kind of deal?

166
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,700
Except that wasn't a legend.
You know his music.

167
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,200
You don't know
Robert Johnson songs?

168
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,300
Sam, there's occult references
all over his lyrics.

169
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,200
I mean, "cross road blues,"
"me and the devil blues,"

170
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,100
"hellhound on my trail"?

171
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,300
Story goes that he died
choking on his own blood.

172
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,100
He was hallucinating and
muttering about big, evil dogs.

173
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,300
And now it's happening
all over again.
Yeah.

174
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,500
We got to find out if anyone
else struck any bargains.

175
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Right, so, we got to clean up
these people's mess for them?

176
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
They're not exactly
squeaky-clean.

177
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Nobody put a gun
to their head

178
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,300
and forced them to play
"let's make a deal."

179
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
So, what, we should
just leave them to die?

180
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,700
Somebody goes over niagara
in a barrel,

181
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,800
you gonna jump in
to try to save them?

182
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,300
Dean...

183
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,100
All right...fine.

184
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,700
Rituals like this,

185
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,400
you got to put your own photo
into the mix, right?

186
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
So this guy
probably summoned the thing.

187
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Let's see if anyone inside
knows him...

188
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,500
If he's still alive.

189
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
What's this guy's name,
again?

190
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
George darrow.

191
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,900
Apparent quite the regular
at lloyd's.

192
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,800
This house probably ain't up
next on "mtv cribs," is it?

193
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,700
[ chuckling ] Yeah.

194
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,200
So, whatever kind of deal
he made...

195
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,300
Wasn't for cash.
Ah, who knows?

196
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,800
Maybe his place is full of babes
in princess Leia bikinis.

197
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,300
I'm just saying, this guy's got
one epic bill come due.

198
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,600
Hope at least he asked
for something fun.

199
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,700
Look at that.

200
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,900
What is that, pepper?

201
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Who the hell are you?

202
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,600
George darrow?

203
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm not buying anything.

204
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,600
Whoa, looks likeou went
for the wrong shaker, there.

205
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
Usually, when you want to keep
something evil out,

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
you go for the salt.

207
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

208
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,700
Talking about this.

209
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,300
Tell me...

210
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,200
You seen that hellhound yet?

211
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,500
Look, we want to help.

212
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,100
Please, just 5 minutes.

213
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,300
So, what is that stuff
out front?

214
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,800
Goofer dust.

215
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,800
What, you boys think you know
something about something,

216
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,100
but not goofer dust?

217
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,600
Well, we know a little
about a lot of things,

218
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,500
just enough
to make us dangerous.

219
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,500
What is it?

220
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,300
Hoodoo.

221
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
My grandma taught me.

222
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,200
Keeps out demons.

223
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,000
Demons, we know.

224
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,200
Well, then, keep it.

225
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,500
Maybe it'll do you
some good.

226
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,600
4 minutes left.

227
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,200
Mr. Darrow...
We know you're in trouble.

228
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,100
Yeah, that you got yourself
into.

229
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,700
But it's not hopeless,
all right?

230
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,600
There's got to be something
we can do.

231
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,800
Listen, i get that you boys
want to help,

232
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,300
but sometimes a person
makes their bed

233
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,900
and they just got to lie down
in it.

234
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,700
I'm the one called that demon
in the first place.

235
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,300
What'd you do it for?

236
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,800
I was weak.

237
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I mean,
who don't want to be great?

238
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,700
Who don't want their life
to mean something?

239
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,300
I just... [sighs]

240
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,500
I just never thought
about the price.

241
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,700
Was it worth it?

242
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,600
Hell, no.

243
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,900
Course, i asked for talent.

244
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,100
Should have gone for fame.

245
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,900
I'm still broke...and lonely.

246
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,100
Just now i got this pile of
paintings don't nobody want.

247
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,000
That wasn't the worst.

248
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,900
Go on.

249
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,800
Demon didn't leave.

250
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I never counted on that.

251
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,000
After our deal was done,

252
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,400
the damn thing stayed at lloyd's
for a week,

253
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,900
just chatting,
making more deals.

254
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
I tried to warn folks,

255
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,600
but who gonna listen
to an old drunk?

256
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
How many others are there?

257
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,300
Uh, this architect,
a doctor Lady.

258
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,100
I kept up with them.
They been in the papers.

259
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,700
[ sighs ]
At least they got famous.

260
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Who else, George?
Come on, think.

261
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,300
Oh, one more.

262
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,000
Uh, nice guy, too.

263
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Hudson -- evani think.

264
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,400
I don't know what he asked for.

265
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,700
Don't matter now.
We done for.

266
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,700
No.
No, there's got to be a way.

267
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,900
You don't get it.

268
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
I don't want a way.

269
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,300
Look, you don't --

270
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,300
look, i called that thing!

271
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,800
I brought it on myself!

272
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,900
I brought it on them.

273
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm going to hell,
one way or another.

274
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,300
All i want is to finish
my last painting.

275
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,900
Day or two, I'm done.

276
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,900
I'm just trying to hold him off
till then,

277
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,300
buy a little time.

278
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,200
Okay, boys, time you went.

279
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,500
Go help somebody
that wants help.

280
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
We can't just --
get out!

281
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
I got work to do.

282
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,200
You don't really
want to die.

283
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,200
I don't?

284
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,800
I'm tired.

285
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,100
Evan?

286
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,900
Are you spying
on the neighbors?

287
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,400
No, i, uh, i thought i heard
something in the yard,

288
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,600
but it's nothing.

289
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
You all ready to go?

290
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,500
You know,
if i didn't know better,

291
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,200
I'd say that you want me
out of the house.

292
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,800
Of course not.

293
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,100
It's just, you've --

294
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,800
you've barely seen your sister
since she had the baby.

295
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,100
Well, what are you going to do
all weekend?

296
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,500
Um, not much.

297
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,600
I got some Bills to pay.

298
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
Come here.

299
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll miss you.

300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,300
You better.

301
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
You know i love you, right?

302
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,600
Forever.

303
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,600
Of course.
Evan, are you okay?

304
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,800
Yeah.

305
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,900
Yeah, I'm fine.

306
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,200
Now, get going.

307
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,500
Okay, I'll call you
when i get there.

308
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,000
Hey, sweetie?

309
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,300
I love you, too.

310
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Yes?

311
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,200
Evan Hudson?
Yeah.

312
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,100
You ever been to a bar
called lloyd's?

313
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,900
Would have been
about 10 years ago.

314
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
Come on, we're not demons.

315
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,400
Any other bright ideas?

316
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,000
Evan?

317
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,100
Please!
Don't hurt me.

318
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,600
We're not gonna hurt you,
all right?

319
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
We're here to help you.

320
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,600
We know all about
the genius deal you made.

321
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,900
What? How?

322
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,400
Doesn't matter.

323
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,900
All that matters is
we're trying to stop it.

324
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,100
How do i know you're not lying?

325
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,600
Well, you don't,

326
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,500
but you're kind of running low
on options, there, Buddy boy.

327
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,800
C-can you stop it?

328
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,700
Don't know.
We'll try.

329
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,900
I don't want to die.

330
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,600
Of course you don't.
Not now.

331
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Dean, stop.

332
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,900
What'd you ask for,
anyway, ev, huh?

333
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,800
Never need Viagra,
bowl a perfect game, what?

334
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,000
My wife.

335
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,900
Right, getting the girl.
That's worth a trip to hell for.

336
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Dean, stop.

337
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,400
No. He's right.
I made the deal.

338
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,700
Nobody twisted my arm.

339
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,600
That, uh, woman,

340
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,400
or whatever she was,
at the bar,

341
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
she said i could have
anything i wanted.

342
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,200
I thought she was nuts,
at first, but...

343
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,000
I don't know.
I was -- i was desperate.

344
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,300
Desperate?

345
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,100
Julie was dying.

346
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,300
You did it to save her?

347
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
She had cancer.
They had stopped treatment.

348
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
They were moving her
into hospice.

349
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,400
They kept saying,
"matter of days."

350
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,600
So, yeah, i made the deal...
And I'd do it again.

351
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,400
I'd have died for her
on the spot.

352
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,600
Did you ever think about her
in all this?

353
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
I did this for her.

354
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
You sure about that?

355
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,300
I think you did it
for yourself...

356
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,300
So you wouldn't have to live
without her.

357
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,600
But, guess what, she's gonna
have to live without <i>you</i> now.

358
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
What if she knew
how much it cost?

359
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
What if she knew
it cost your soul?

360
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,300
How do you think she'd feel?

361
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,800
Okay, that's enough.

362
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,100
Evan, sit tight, all right?
We're gonna figure this out.

363
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,500
You all right?
Why wouldn't i be?

364
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Hey, i got an idea.

365
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,100
You throw George's hoodoo
at that hellhound,

366
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,900
keep it away from Evan
as long as you can.

367
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
I'm gonna go to the crossroads
and summon the demon.

368
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,100
Summon -- are you nuts?

369
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,300
Maybe a little.

370
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,600
But i can trap it.

371
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I can exorcise it,

372
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
and i can buy us time to figure
out something more permanent.

373
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,600
Yeah, but how much time?
I don't know. Awhile.

374
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not easy for those suckers

375
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,900
to claw their way back from hell
and into the sunshine.

376
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,700
No. No way.

377
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,600
Not allowed to say no, Sammy,
unless you got a better idea.

378
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,000
Dean, you can forget it,
all right?

379
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
I'm not letting you summon
that demon

380
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,800
because i don't like where
your head is at right now.

381
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,100
????

382
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,600
You've been on edge ever since
we found that crossroads, Dean,

383
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
and i think i know why.

384
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
We don't have time
for this.

385
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,300
Dad.

386
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,600
You think maybe dad made
one of these deals, huh?

387
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
Hell, I've been thinking it.

388
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I'm sure you've been
thinking it, too.

389
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,900
It fits, doesn't it?

390
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,500
I'm alive, dad's dead.
Yellow-eyed demon was involved.

391
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
What if he did?

392
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,900
What if he struck a deal?

393
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,600
My life for his soul.

394
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
Evan: Hey, guys, i think
i hear it! It's outside!

395
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Just keep him alive, okay?

396
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,800
Dean?

397
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Go!

398
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,700
So, what brings a guy like you
to a place like this?

399
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,000
You called me?

400
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,200
I'm just glad it worked.

401
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,800
First time?

402
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,700
You could say that.

403
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,400
Oh, come on, now.

404
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Don't sell yourself short.

405
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,100
I know all about you,
Dean Winchester.

406
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,200
So you know who i am.

407
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,000
I get the newsletter.

408
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,100
Well,
don't keep me in suspense.

409
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,000
What have you heard?

410
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,600
Well,
i heard you were handsome.

411
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,200
You're just edible.

412
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,400
What can i do for you, Dean?

413
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,100
Maybe we should do this
in my car.

414
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,800
Nice and private.

415
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,000
Sounds good to me.

416
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,100
What is that stuff?

417
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,400
Goofer dust.

418
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,500
Are you serious?

419
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,300
Yeah. Afraid so.

420
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,300
Look, believe me,
don't believe me --
whatever you want.

421
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,500
Just whatever you do, stay
inside this circle, all right?

422
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,300
So, i was hoping
we could strike a deal.

423
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,500
That's what i do.

424
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,800
I want Evan Hudson released
from his contract.

425
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,500
So sorry, darling.
That's not negotiable.

426
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
I'll make it
worth your while.

427
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh, really?

428
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,300
What are you offering?

429
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,500
Me.

430
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,800
Well, well, well.

431
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,700
You'd sacrifice your life
for someone else's.

432
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,300
Like father, like son.

433
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,300
That's the last of it.

434
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,300
You did know
about your dad's deal, right?

435
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,900
His life for yours.

436
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,800
Oh, i didn't make the deal
myself,

437
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,400
but, boy, i wish i had.

438
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,700
After you.

439
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,900
Such a gentleman.

440
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,500
A devil's trap?

441
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
You've got to be kidding me.

442
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,200
[ growling ]
What?

443
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,400
You hear that?

444
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,900
No. Where?

445
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,200
Right outside the door.

446
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
Just don't move, all right?

447
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,000
Stay where you are.

448
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,200
You stupid, stupid...

449
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,400
I should rip you
limb from limb.

450
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,800
Take your best shot.

451
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,000
No, i don't think so.

452
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,900
I'm not gonna put you
out of your misery.

453
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
Yeah? Why not?

454
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
'Cause your misery
is the whole point.

455
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,400
It's too much fun to watch.

456
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Knowing how your daddy died
for you,

457
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,100
how he sold his soul.

458
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,600
I mean, that's got to hurt.

459
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
He's all you ever think about.

460
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,600
You wake up,
and your first thought is

461
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
"i can't do this anymore."

462
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,400
You're all lit up with pain.

463
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,200
I mean,
you loved him so much.

464
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
And it's all your fault.

465
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,800
You blew it, Dean.

466
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,600
I could have given you
what you need.

467
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,000
What do i need?

468
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,400
Your father.

469
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I could have brought him back.

470
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,900
Your loss.

471
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,700
See ya, Dean.

472
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,300
I wish you a nice, long life.

473
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,200
Hold on.

474
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,600
Do you still hear it?
No.

475
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,700
Is it over?

476
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,700
It's here!

477
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,900
You're lucky I've got
a soft spot

478
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,500
for lost puppies
and long faces.

479
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,100
I just can't leave you
like this.

480
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,000
Besides, you didn't call me here
to bargain for Evan.

481
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,900
Not really.

482
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,300
Can you bring him back,
my dad?

483
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,000
Of course i can,
just as he was.

484
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,100
Your dad would live
a long, natural life,

485
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,000
like he was meant to.

486
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,100
That's a promise.

487
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,200
What about me?

488
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,900
I could give you 10 years,

489
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,800
10 long, good years with him.

490
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,400
That's a lifetime.

491
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,900
The family could be together
again --

492
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,300
John, Dean, Sammy.

493
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,400
The Winchester boys
all reunited.

494
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,300
Look, your dad
is supposed to be alive.

495
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,400
You're supposed to be dead.

496
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
So, we'll just set things
straight,

497
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,700
put things
back in their natural order,

498
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,400
and you get 10 extra years
on top.

499
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,100
That's a bonus.

500
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,300
You think you could...

501
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,500
Throw in a set
of steak knives?

502
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,500
You know, this smartass
self-defense mechanism
of yours...

503
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,200
Dean...

504
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,600
Now you're really trapped.

505
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,100
That's got to hurt.

506
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
Let me out now.

507
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,000
Sure.

508
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,400
We just got to make
a little deal here first.

509
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,300
You call off your hellhound
and let Evan go.

510
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Then I'll let you go.

511
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,000
I can't break
a binding contract.

512
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,400
And by "can't,"
you mean "don't want to"?

513
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,900
Last chance.

514
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Evan and his wife get to live
to a ripe old age.

515
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,900
Going...going...

516
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,700
Let's talk about this.
Okay, gone.

517
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,900
Evan: Can't you see it?
No.stay inside the circle!

518
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,600
Come on, Dean.

519
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
What are you doing?

520
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,100
Oh, you're just gonna go
on a little trip.

521
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,900
Way down South.

522
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,400
Look, forget Evan.
Think of your dad.

523
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,800
<i> Egna terrae, cantate deo,</i>
<i>psallite domino.</i>

524
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,900
<i> Ui fertur super caelum caeli</i>
<i>ad orientem,</i>

525
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,400

<i>vocem virtutis.</i>

526
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
<i> Ribuite virtutem deo.</i>

527
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,100
<i> Ui fertur super caelum caeli</i>
<i>ad orientem,</i>

528
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,400
<i>ecce dabit vocem suam,</i>
<i>vocem virtutis.</i>

529
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,600
Circle's broken! Come on!

530
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,600
<i> Egna terrae, cantate deo,</i>
<i>psallite domino.</i>

531
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,700
<i> Ui fertur super caelum caeli</i>
<i>ad orientem,</i>

532
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,700
<i>ecce dabit.</i>

533
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
<i> Ade, satana,</i>

534
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,000
<i>inventor et magister</i>
<i>omnis fallaciae,</i>

535
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,700
<i>hostis humanae salutis.</i>

536
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,700
<i> Umiliare sub potenti</i>
<i>manu dei.</i>

537
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,900
Release!

538
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
What the hell was that for?

539
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,300
Sealing the deal.

540
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,900
I usually like to be warned

541
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
before I'm violated
with demon tongue.

542
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,800
Evan Hudson is free.

543
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
He and his wife
will live long lives.

544
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,100
How do i know
you're not lying?

545
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,400
My word is my Bond.

546
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh, really?
It is when i make a deal.

547
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,200
It's the rules.

548
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,700
You got what you wanted.

549
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,300
Now let me go.

550
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,200
You're gonna double-cross me?

551
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,600
Funny how
I'm the trustworthy one.

552
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,200
You know, you renege,
send me to hell,

553
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,100
sooner or later
I'm gonna climb out,

554
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,300
and skinning Evan Hudson will be
the first thing that i do.

555
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,100
I got to tell you,

556
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,000
knew what?

557
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,800
Where your dad is.

558
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,800
You should have made
that deal.

559
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,900
See, people talk about hell,
but it's just a word.

560
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,700
Doesn't even come close
to describing the real --

561
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
shut your mouth, bitch.

562
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,100
If you could see
your poor daddy,

563
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,800
hear the sounds he makes
'cause he can't even scream.

564
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,000
How about i send you
back there?

565
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,600
What?

566
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,400
How did i get here?

567
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,500
Demons lie all the time,
right?

568
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,700
Maybe she was lying.

569
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,300
Come on.
Is that really what you think?

570
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,600
How could he do it?

571
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
He did it for you.

572
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,400
Exactly.

573
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,900
How am i supposed to live
with that?

574
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,700
You know,
the thought of him,

575
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,600
wherever he is right now...

576
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,800
I mean,
he spent his whole life

577
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,300
chasing that yellow-eyed
son of a bitch.

578
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,500
He should have gone out
fighting.

579
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,500
That was supposed to be
his legacy, you know?

580
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,900
Not bargaining
with the damn thing.

581
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,700
Not this.

582
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,000
How many people
do you think dad saved total?

583
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,700
That's not the point, Sam.

584
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,300
Evan Hudson is safe
because of what dad taught us.

585
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
That's his legacy, Dean.

586
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,600
Now, we're still here, man,
so we got to keep going.

587
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,300
For him.

588
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,100
Dean?
Yeah?

589
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,200
When you were trapping that
demon, you weren't...

590
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,100
I mean, it was all a trick,
right?

591
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,500
You never considered actually
making that deal, right?

592
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,300
I swear it's not in me.
It's not in me, i swear.

593
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,800
We're all gonna die.

594
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,700
We got no choice.
Stop!

595
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,400
Now, Dean, they say you can't
protect your loved ones forever.

596
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
Hands where i can see 'em!

597
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,500
Dean: A demonic virus?
Sam: Yeah, more like
demonic germ warfare.

598
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,400
I feel like Chuck heston
in "the omega man."

599
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,300
They're infected,
not me!

600
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,900
You've known me all your life!

601
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,100
Let's just go.

602
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,300
We can't, 'cause
those things are everywhere.

603
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,700
Man: She bled on him.

604
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,000
He's got the virus.

605
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,600
Sam:
I need a nationwide search.

606
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
What am i looking for?

607
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
Psychics, like me --
as many as possible.

608
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,400
The yellow-eyed man...
Comes to me in my dreams

609
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,500
and tells me to do things,
awful things.

610
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,700
I had this one dream

611
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,600
where i saw this guy get stabbed
in a parking lot.

612
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,700
He has plans for me.

613
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
What kind of plans?

614
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,700
Last night i saw you die.

615
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,700
Right before dad died,
he told me something.

616
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,000
He told me something
about you.

617
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,200
Dean, what did he tell you?

618
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:54,500
