1
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,818
<i>Drew: like when you put
on "a little" eye shadow.</i>

2
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:11,286
<i>And, you know, all this stuff,</i>

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,286
<i>It's just very unprofessional.</i>

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,886
<i>Don't touch the troll!</i>

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,353
<i>Is that what your mom
used to say to your dates?</i>

6
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:25,787
<i>Put the trolls down,</i>

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,919
<i>Or i'll put a staple
right between your eyes.</i>

8
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:30,653
<i>Now, i know it's hard.</i>

9
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:33,453
<i>It's hard to look up when you're down.</i>

10
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:36,286
<i>It's hard to look up and see the light.</i>

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,553
<i>But i'm here to tell you folks...</i>

12
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:41,220
<i>The lord is with you.</i>

13
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,120
<i>You don't have to suffer.</i>

14
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,120
<i>You don't have to be lost.</i>

15
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:59,286
<i>The lord is talking to you right now.</i>

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,487
<i>He's saying, "you are my
child, and you have a purpose."</i>

17
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,587
<i>You think god forgot
about you? I tell you, no!</i>

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,186
<i>All you got to do is listen.</i>

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,754
<i>Can't you just hear
those angels singing?</i>

20
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:12,320
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,553
<i>It's time.</i>

22
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:19,453
<i>It's time to receive
the message he's sending.</i>

23
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:23,086
<i>It's time to listen to the word of god!</i>

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,854
<i>Can you hear the glory?</i>

25
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,820
<i>I said, can't you just hear it?</i>

26
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,553
<i>I say, can't you just hear the lord?</i>

27
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:09,736
Good morning. You're not the usual guy.

28
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:14,836
No, uh... just filling in.

29
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,237
So, how you feeling today, gloria?

30
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,836
I've never felt better.

31
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,304
So, no disturbances lately?

32
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:26,037
You mean, am i stark-Raving
cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

33
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,636
I didn't say that.

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,870
It's all right. I know
what people must think.

35
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:33,270
<i>What do you think?</i>

36
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:35,770
I think what i saw was real.

37
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,636
I'd like to know what you saw.

38
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:57,103
It was all over the news.

39
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,903
I stabbed a man in the heart.

40
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,736
Why would you do that?

41
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,536
Because it was god's will.

42
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,903
Did god talk to you?

43
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:09,636
I get the sense god's a
little busy for house calls.

44
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,903
No, he -- He
sent someone.

45
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:14,304
Someone?

46
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,337
An angel.

47
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:22,603
It came to me in this
beautiful white light.

48
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:27,736
And it filled me with this...feeling.

49
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,603
It's -- It's
hard to describe.

50
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,237
And this angel...

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,103
Spoke god's word.

52
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:37,937
And the word was to kill someone?

53
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,370
I know it sounds strange.

54
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,603
But what i did was very important.

55
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,937
I helped him smite an evil man.

56
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,870
I was chosen...

57
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:51,404
For redemption.

58
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:54,370
This man you stabbed -- Did
the angel give you his name?

59
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:55,703
No.

60
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,469
He just told me to wait for the sign,

61
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:00,237
And the very next day,

62
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,503
I saw it right beside the man's doorway,

63
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:03,703
And i knew.

64
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:04,803
Why him?

65
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:07,370
I just know what
the angel told me --

66
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:11,103
That this man was guilty
to his deepest foundations.

67
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,037
And that was good enough for me.

68
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,237
Hey.

69
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:45,703
Sam: hey!

70
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,436
Hey, man, you got to try this.

71
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:51,770
I mean, there really is
magic in the magic fingers.

72
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:54,636
Dean, you're enjoying that way too much.

73
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,803
It's kind of making me uncomfortable.

74
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:59,469
You got me on lockdown here.
I'm bored out of my skull.

75
00:04:59,503 --> 00:05:03,870
Hey, you were the bank robber
on the 11:00 news, not me.

76
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,469
We can't risk you just walking
into a government facility.

77
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:07,503
Mmm.

78
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,270
Aw, damn it.

79
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:17,137
That was my last quarter.

80
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,803
Hey!

81
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:20,703
You got any quarters?

82
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,003
No.

83
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:26,003
So, did you get in to
see that crazy hooker?

84
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,937
Yeah. Gloria sitnik.

85
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,770
And i'm not so sure she's crazy.

86
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:31,503
But she seriously believes

87
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:33,337
That she was... touched by an angel?

88
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,970
Yeah.

89
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,503
Blinding light, feelings of
spiritual ecstasy, the works.

90
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:40,270
I mean, she's living in a locked ward,

91
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:42,304
And she's totally at peace.

92
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:44,370
Oh, yeah, you're right
-- Sounds completely sane.

93
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:46,203
What about the dude she stabbed?

94
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,703
Uh, carl gulley.

95
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:49,503
Said she killed him 'cause he was evil.

96
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:50,970
Was he? I don't know.

97
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:53,003
I couldn't find any dirt on him.

98
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:54,636
He didn't have a criminal record,

99
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,037
He worked at the campus
library, had lots of friends,

100
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,736
Was a churchgoer.

101
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,870
Hmm. So gloria's just
your standard-Issue wacko?

102
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,436
I mean, she wouldn't be
the first nutjob in history

103
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,170
To kill in the name of
religion, know what i mean?

104
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:09,937
No, but she's the second in town

105
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,070
To murder because an angel told them to.

106
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:13,603
Little bit odd, don't you think?

107
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:15,370
Odd -- Yeah.
Supernatural -- Maybe.

108
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:17,103
But angels -- I
don't think so.

109
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:18,603
Why not?

110
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:21,503
'Cause there's no such thing, sam.

111
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:24,937
Dean, there's 10 times
as much lore about angels

112
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,404
As there is about anything
else we've ever hunted.

113
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:29,304
There's a ton of lore on unicorns, too.

114
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:32,003
I hear that they ride
on silver moonbeams

115
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,237
And they shoot rainbows
out of their ass.

116
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,237
Wait, there's no such thing as unicorns?

117
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,170
That's cute.

118
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:40,736
I'm just saying, man,
there's some legends

119
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,970
That you just file under "bull crap."

120
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,703
And you got angels on
the "bull crap" list?

121
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:47,770
Yep.

122
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:48,870
Why?

123
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:51,370
Because i've never seen one.

124
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:52,636
So what?

125
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,137
So i believe in what i can see.

126
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,003
Dean, you and i have seen things

127
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:58,970
Most people couldn't even dream about.

128
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:00,569
Exactly.

129
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,970
With our own eyes --
That's hard proof, okay?

130
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:04,436
But in all this time,

131
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,903
I have never seen anything
that looks like an angel.

132
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:09,870
Don't you think we would
have crossed paths with them

133
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:12,170
Or at least know someone
that crossed paths with them?

134
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:14,937
No. This is a demon or a spirit.

135
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,404
They find people a few
fries short of a happy meal,

136
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,337
And they trick them into
killing these randoms.

137
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,270
Maybe.

138
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,304
Can we just -- I'm
going stir-Crazy, man.

139
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:29,137
Let's go by gloria's apartment, huh?

140
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,536
I was just there. Nothing.

141
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:33,270
No sulfur, no e.M.F.

142
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:36,404
You didn't see any fluffy,
white wing feathers?

143
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,270
But gloria did say the
angel gave her a sign

144
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,603
Right beside carl gulley's doorway.

145
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:45,703
Could be something at his
house. It's worth checking out.

146
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,203
Hey, sam.

147
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:16,736
Think i found it.

148
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:22,320
It's a sign from up above.

149
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,386
I think i learned a valuable lesson.

150
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,820
Always take down your
christmas decorations

151
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:35,153
After new year's,

152
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:38,119
Or you might get filleted
by a hooker from god.

153
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:42,453
I'm laughing on the inside.

154
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,119
You know, gloria said

155
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,453
The guy was guilty to
his deepest foundations.

156
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:12,054
You think she literally
meant the foundation?

157
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,687
Hmm.

158
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:59,054
You got something?

159
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:02,820
What is it?

160
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:09,054
It's a fingernail.

161
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:33,753
So much for the innocent
churchgoing librarian.

162
00:10:33,787 --> 00:10:35,687
Whatever spoke to gloria about this

163
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,420
Knew what it was talking
about -- I'll give you that.

164
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:28,520
Yes?

165
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:31,386
Hi. My name is zach.

166
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,920
Can i help you?

167
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,186
Ugh!

168
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,723
Did you bring quarters?

169
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,228
Dude, i'm not enabling your sick habit.

170
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,690
You're like one of those lab rats

171
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,723
That pushes the pleasure button
instead of the food button

172
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:18,536
Until it dies.

173
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,953
What are you talking about?
I eat. And i got news.

174
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,986
Me too. All right, you go first.

175
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,187
Three students have disappeared
off the campus this year.

176
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,853
All of them were last
seen at the library.

177
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:30,320
Where carl gulley worked. Sick bastard.

178
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:31,953
So gloria's
angel -- Angel?

179
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,953
Okay, whatever this thing is.

180
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:36,786
Whatever it is, it struck again. What?

181
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,653
I was listening to the police radio.

182
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:40,853
There was this guy, zach
smith, some local drunk.

183
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,986
He went up to a stranger's
front door last night,

184
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,554
Stabbed him in the heart.

185
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:46,986
I'm guessing he went to
the police and confessed?

186
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,120
Yep. Roma downey made him do it.

187
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,220
Now, i, uh...

188
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:54,786
Got the victim's address.

189
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,203
Find anything?

190
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,403
Frank liked his catalog shopping.

191
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,336
That's about all i got. You?

192
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,203
Not much here.

193
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:39,170
Except he's got this one locked
file on his computer that...

194
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:40,703
Hold on.

195
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,036
Not anymore.

196
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,236
God. What?

197
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,036
He's got all these e-Mails,

198
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:00,170
Dozens, to this lady named jennifer.

199
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,370
This lady who's 13 years old.

200
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:09,303
Oh, i don't want to hear this.

201
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:11,737
Looks like they met in a chat room.

202
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,003
These e-Mails are
pretty personal, dean.

203
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:17,470
Look at that.

204
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,236
Setting up a time and
place to meet. Great.

205
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,936
They were supposed to meet today.

206
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:26,503
Huh.

207
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:29,103
Well, i guess if you're
gonna stab someone,

208
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,103
Good timing.

209
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:33,570
I don't know, man. This is weird.

210
00:15:33,603 --> 00:15:36,804
I mean, sure, some spirits
are out for vengeance,

211
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:39,370
But this one's almost
like a do-Gooder, like a --

212
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,203
Avenging angel?

213
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:44,303
Well, how else do you explain it, dean?

214
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:46,303
Three guys not connected to each other

215
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,969
All stabbed through the heart?

216
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,537
At least two were world-Class pervs,

217
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,804
And i bet if you dug deep
enough on the other guy --

218
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:54,236
Hey. What?

219
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,136
You said carl gulley
was a churchgoer, right?

220
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,236
Yeah.

221
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,603
What was the name of his church?

222
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:03,737
Uh... our lady of the angels?

223
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,837
Of course that would be the name.

224
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,969
Looks like frank went
to the same church.

225
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,170
Man: so, you're interested
in joining the parish?

226
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:23,003
We just don't feel right unless
we hit church every sunday.

227
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:24,570
Where'd you say you lived before?

228
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:25,904
Premont, texas.

229
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:29,236
Really? At's a nice
town. St. Teresa's parish.

230
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,804
You must know the priest there.

231
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:33,969
Sure, yeah. No, it's fr. O'malley.

232
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:36,437
I know a fr. Shaughnessy.

233
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,437
Shaughnessy, exactly. What did i say?

234
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,570
You know, we're just happy
to be here now, father.

235
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:41,837
And we're happy to have you.

236
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,737
We could use some
young blood around here.

237
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,136
I got to ask -- No offense,
but the neighborhood...

238
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,603
It's gone to seed a little.
There's no denying that.

239
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:52,003
But that's why what the church
does here is so important.

240
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,003
Like i always say, you
can expect a miracle,

241
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:56,036
But in the meantime,
you work your butt off.

242
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:57,804
Yeah, we heard about the murders.

243
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:59,737
The victims were parishioners of mine.

244
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,336
I've known them for years.

245
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,003
And the killers said that
an angel made them do that?

246
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,170
Yes. Misguided souls.

247
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:07,936
To think that god's messenger

248
00:17:07,969 --> 00:17:11,003
Would appear and incite people
to murder -- It's tragic.

249
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:13,470
So, you don't believe in
those angel yarns, huh?

250
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,203
Oh, no, i absolutely believe.

251
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:17,103
It kind of goes with
the job description.

252
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,537
Father, that's michael, right?

253
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,603
That's right.

254
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:25,670
The archangel michael,
with the flaming sword --

255
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:28,069
The fighter of demons,

256
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:31,069
Holy force against evil.

257
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:33,136
So, they're not really
the hallmark-Card version

258
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,203
That everybody thinks?

259
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:37,069
They're fierce, right? Vigilant.

260
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:39,804
I like to think of them as
more loving than wrathful,

261
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:41,570
But, yes,

262
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:45,336
A lot of scripture paints
angels as god's warriors.

263
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,904
"An angel of the lord appeared to them,

264
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,770
"The glory of the lord
shone down upon them,

265
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,770
And they were terrified."

266
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,570
Luke 2:9.

267
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,570
Well, thank you for
speaking with us, father.

268
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:10,670
It's my pleasure. Hope to see you again.

269
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,804
Father, what's all that for?

270
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:17,336
Oh, that's for fr. Gregory.
He was a priest here.

271
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,570
Was?

272
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:20,370
Passed away right on these steps.

273
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,236
He's interred in the church crypt.

274
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,003
When did this happen?

275
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,403
Two months ago. He was
shot for his car keys.

276
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:28,570
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:32,036
Yeah, me too. He was a good friend.

278
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,603
I didn't even have time to
administer his last rites.

279
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:38,036
But like i said, it's
a tough neighborhood.

280
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:42,170
And ever since he died, i've
been praying my heart out.

281
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:43,170
For what?

282
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:44,537
For deliverance...

283
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,870
From the violence and
the bloodshed around here.

284
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,270
We could use a little divine
intervention, i suppose.

285
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:54,870
Well, padre, thanks.

286
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:56,503
We'll see you again.

287
00:19:08,804 --> 00:19:11,069
Well, it's all starting to make sense.

288
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:13,470
Devoted priest dies
a violent death --

289
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:16,036
That's vengeful-Spirit
material right there.

290
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:18,470
He knew all the stiffs 'cause
they went to church here.

291
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,437
I'm willing to bet,
because he was their priest,

292
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,437
He knew things about them
that nobody else knew.

293
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,069
Then again, fr. Reynolds
started praying for god's help

294
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:27,670
About two months ago, right?

295
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:30,236
Right about the time all this started?

296
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,103
Oh, come on, man. What's
your deal? What do you mean?

297
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:35,069
Look, i'll admit, i'm
a bit of a skeptic,

298
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:37,003
But since when are
you all mr. "700 club?"

299
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:39,303
Seriously, from the get-Go,

300
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:41,637
You've been willing to
buy this angel crap, man.

301
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,703
What's next? Are you gonna
start praying every day?

302
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:46,303
I do.

303
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,837
What?

304
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,136
I do pray every day.

305
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,103
I have for a long time.

306
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,303
The things you learn about a guy.

307
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:01,470
Huh.

308
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:06,036
Come on. Let's go check
out fr. Gregory's grave.

309
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,527
Sam, come on, get the lead out.

310
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:54,693
Sammy?

311
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,426
Sammy! Hey.

312
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,660
Okay?

313
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,426
Yeah.

314
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:05,860
Yeah.

315
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,177
Come on.

316
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,877
You saw it, didn't you? Didn't you?

317
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,743
Yeah. Yeah.

318
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,943
Dean, i saw an angel.

319
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,843
You
--

320
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,610
All right, come on.

321
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:32,476
I don't want a drink.

322
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,977
So, what makes you think
you saw a, uh, angel?

323
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,743
Just...

324
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:45,110
It appeared before
me, and i just --

325
00:21:45,143 --> 00:21:48,110
This feeling washed over me, you know?

326
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:51,476
Like -- Like
peace, like grace.

327
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,843
Okay, ecstasy boy, maybe we'll get you

328
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:56,643
Some glow sticks and a
nice dr. Seuss hat, huh?

329
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:58,676
Dean, i'm serious.

330
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,810
It spoke to me. It knew who i was.

331
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:03,344
It's just a spirit, sam.

332
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:05,509
And it's not the first one

333
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,177
To be able to read people's minds.

334
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,376
Okay, let
me guess --

335
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:11,409
You were personally chosen
to smite some sinner?

336
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:13,476
You just got to wait
for me divine bat signal.

337
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:16,344
Is that it? Yeah, actually.

338
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,443
Great.

339
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:21,077
I don't suppose you asked
what this alleged bad guy did.

340
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,210
Actually, i did, dean,
and the angel told me.

341
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,509
He hasn't done anything... yet.

342
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:29,977
But he will.

343
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,676
Oh, this is -- I
don't believe this.

344
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,910
Dean, the angel hasn't been wrong yet.

345
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:38,110
Someone's gonna do something
awful, and i can stop it.

346
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:40,476
You're supposed to be bad, too, sam.

347
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:41,977
Maybe i should stop you right now.

348
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,943
You know what, dean? I don't understand.

349
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:46,043
Why can't you even
consider the possibility?

350
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,409
What, that this is an angel? Yes.

351
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:51,509
Maybe we're hunting an angel
here, and we should stop.

352
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:54,277
Maybe this is god's will.

353
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,843
Okay. All right.

354
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,977
You know what? I get
it. You've got faith.

355
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,610
That's -- Hey,
good for you.

356
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:02,409
I'm sure it makes things easier.

357
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,177
I'll tell you who else
had faith like that -- Mom.

358
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,943
She used to tell me
when she tucked me in

359
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,177
That angels were watching over us.

360
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,710
In fact, that was the last
thing she ever said to me.

361
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:16,509
You never told me that.

362
00:23:16,543 --> 00:23:18,344
What's to tell?

363
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:20,010
She was wrong.

364
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:22,977
There was nothing protecting her.

365
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,344
There's no higher power. There's no god.

366
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:29,476
There's just chaos and violence

367
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:34,376
And random, unpredictable
evil that comes out of nowhere

368
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:36,776
And rips you to shreds.

369
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,344
You want me to believe in this stuff?

370
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,277
I'm gonna need to see some hard proof.

371
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,476
You got any?

372
00:23:44,943 --> 00:23:46,344
Well, i do.

373
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:49,210
Proof that we're dealing with a spirit.

374
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:59,043
That looks
like --

375
00:23:59,077 --> 00:24:00,576
It's wormwood...

376
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,376
A plant associated with the dead,

377
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,509
Specifically the ones
that are not at rest.

378
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,877
I don't see it growing anywhere else,

379
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,543
Except over the
murdered priest's marker.

380
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:12,244
It's him, sam.

381
00:24:12,277 --> 00:24:14,177
Maybe.

382
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,010
Maybe?

383
00:24:17,043 --> 00:24:18,877
Dean, i don't know what to think.

384
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,576
Okay.

385
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:24,810
Want some more proof?
I'll give you more proof.

386
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:26,244
How?

387
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:28,476
We'll summon gregory's spirit.

388
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,110
What?

389
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:32,943
Here? In the church?

390
00:24:32,977 --> 00:24:34,610
Yeah.

391
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:37,776
Yeah, we just need a few odds and ends

392
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,177
And that séance ritual in dad's journal.

393
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,310
A séance, great. I
hope whoopi's available.

394
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:45,509
That's funny, actually. Seriously.

395
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,710
If fr. Gregory's spirit is around,

396
00:24:48,743 --> 00:24:50,610
The séance will bring him right to us.

397
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:53,509
If it's him, then we'll put him to rest.

398
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:55,743
But if it's an angel, it won't show.

399
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:57,509
Nothing will happen.

400
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:59,010
Exactly.

401
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:00,910
It's one of the perks of the job, sam.

402
00:25:00,943 --> 00:25:02,643
We don't have to operate on faith.

403
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:04,977
We can know for sure.

404
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,110
Don't you want to know for sure?

405
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,543
Dude...

406
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:16,743
All right, i'll admit,

407
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:19,376
We've gone pretty ghetto
with the spell work before,

408
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:20,643
But this takes the cake.

409
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:23,543
I mean, a spongebob place
mat instead of an altar cloth?

410
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:25,843
We'll just put it
spongebob-Side-Down.

411
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,277
Dean, that's it.

412
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,344
What?

413
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,843
That's the sign.

414
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:36,610
Where?

415
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:37,843
Right behind that guy.

416
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:39,610
That's him, dean.

417
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:42,010
And we have to stop him.

418
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,626
Wait a minute.

419
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:51,027
What are you doing?

420
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,127
You're not gonna kill somebody
because a ghost told you to.

421
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,494
I'm not gonna kill
him. I'm gonna stop him.

422
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:59,693
Define "stop," huh? I
mean, what are you gonna do?

423
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,460
Dean, please.

424
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,327
He's gonna hurt someone. You know it.

425
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:08,726
All right, come on.

426
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,027
Dean.

427
00:26:17,394 --> 00:26:18,726
Unlock my door.

428
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,893
You're not killing anyone, sam.

429
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:22,860
I got this guy. You go do the séance.

430
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:24,793
Dean.

431
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,893
What are you doing?

432
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,926
What is this?

433
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,860
Father, please. I can explain.

434
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,893
Uh...

435
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:11,360
Actually, maybe i can't. Um...

436
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,127
This is a... a séance.

437
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,693
A séance?

438
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:21,127
Young man, you are in a house of god.

439
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,626
It's based on early christian
rites, if that helps.

440
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:25,659
Enough. You're coming with me.

441
00:28:25,693 --> 00:28:28,593
Father, please, just wait a second.

442
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:33,227
Oh, my god.

443
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:37,327
Is that...

444
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,093
Is that an angel?

445
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:41,559
No, it's not.

446
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:45,960
It's just fr. Gregory.

447
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:54,060
Thomas!

448
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:57,427
I've come in answer to your prayers.

449
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:19,659
Sam....i thought i
sent you on your path.

450
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:21,494
You should hurry.

451
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,993
Father, i'm sorry.

452
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:28,760
But you're not an angel.

453
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:30,693
Of course i am.

454
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,793
No.

455
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:34,160
You're a man.

456
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:37,860
You're a spirit.

457
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,659
And you need to rest.

458
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:42,093
I was a man...

459
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:43,626
But now i'm an angel.

460
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,926
I was on the steps at the church.

461
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,193
I felt that bullet
pierce right through me.

462
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:55,060
But there was no pain.

463
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,327
And, suddenly, i could see...

464
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,993
Everything.

465
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:04,360
Fr. Reynolds, i saw you...

466
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:07,293
Praying and crying here.

467
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:10,360
I came to help you.

468
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,394
Help me how?

469
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:41,494
Damn it!

470
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:44,559
Those
murders --

471
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,293
That was because of you?

472
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:49,193
I received the word of god.

473
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:52,193
He spoke to me, told
me to smite the wicked.

474
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,427
I'm carrying out his will.

475
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,427
You're driving innocent people to kill.

476
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,860
Those innocent people are
being offered redemption.

477
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:04,626
Some people need redemption.

478
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,693
Don't they, sam?

479
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:09,826
How can you call this redemption?

480
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:14,260
You can't understand it now.

481
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:16,726
But the rules of man
and the rules of god

482
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,160
Are two very different things.

483
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:22,160
Those people --
They're locked up.

484
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:23,726
No, they're happy.

485
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,127
They've found peace,
beaten their demons.

486
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,494
And i've given them the keys to heaven.

487
00:31:29,526 --> 00:31:31,494
No, no. This is vengeance.

488
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:32,926
It's wrong.

489
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,993
Thomas, this goes against
everything you believed.

490
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,093
You're lost, misguided.

491
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:41,593
Father... no, i'm not misguided.

492
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:43,926
You are not an angel, thomas.

493
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,127
Men cannot be angels.

494
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:51,394
But...

495
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:54,293
But i-I don't understand.

496
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,293
You prayed for me to come.

497
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,760
I prayed for god's help, not this.

498
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:06,193
What you're doing is not god's will.

499
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:08,360
"Thou shalt not kill."

500
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,394
That's the word of god.

501
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:20,960
How come we stopped?

502
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,593
Um, weren't we gonna go to the movies?

503
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,760
We should go, or we're gonna be late.

504
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:37,394
I'm sorry.

505
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:39,427
It's just, i've never done this before.

506
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,860
Look, i said i was sorry.

507
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:45,659
Please...

508
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
Stop it!

509
00:33:07,926 --> 00:33:09,860
Are you okay? Are you okay?

510
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:12,893
Thank god! Thank god!

511
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:15,526
Damn it.

512
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,793
Are you sure you're okay?

513
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:20,693
You have a cellphone? Call 911.

514
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:39,526
Let us help you.

515
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,760
No.

516
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:44,593
It's time to rest,
thomas, to be at peace.

517
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:48,060
Please. Let me give you last rites.

518
00:33:56,526 --> 00:33:58,260
O holy hosts above,

519
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:01,093
I call upon thee as a servant of christ

520
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:03,593
To sanctify our actions this day

521
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,860
In fulfillment of the will of god.

522
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:14,526
Fr. Reynolds?

523
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,060
Rest.

524
00:34:26,793 --> 00:34:29,793
I call upon the archangel raphael,

525
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:34,027
Master of the air, to make open the way.

526
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,060
Let the fire of the
holy spirit now descend,

527
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:42,726
That this being might be
awakened to the world beyond.

528
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:10,726
Holy...

529
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:50,310
<i>How was your day?</i>

530
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:00,043
You were right.

531
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,576
It wasn't an angel. It was gregory.

532
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:29,443
I don't know, dean, i just...

533
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:37,643
I wanted to believe...

534
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:40,177
So badly.

535
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,443
It's so damn
hard to do this --

536
00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:46,877
What
we do --

537
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,376
All alone, you know?

538
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,776
There's so much evil
out in the world, dean,

539
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,310
I feel like i could drown in it.

540
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:57,210
And when i think about my destiny,

541
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:59,043
When i think about how i could end up...

542
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:02,509
Yeah, well, don't worry
about that, all right?

543
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:05,509
I'm watching out for you.

544
00:38:05,543 --> 00:38:07,743
Yeah, i know you are.

545
00:38:10,177 --> 00:38:12,610
But you're just one person, dean.

546
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:16,576
And i needed to think

547
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,443
That there was something
else watching, too, you know?

548
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:24,110
Some...higher power,

549
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:27,244
Some greater good.

550
00:38:28,877 --> 00:38:32,010
And that maybe...

551
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,977
Maybe what?

552
00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:40,143
Maybe i could be saved.

553
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,310
But, you know, that
just clouded my judgment.

554
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:53,310
And you're right.

555
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:55,843
I mean, we got to go with what we know,

556
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:58,210
With what's right there in
front of our own two eyes.

557
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:00,776
Well, it's funny you say that.

558
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:04,476
Why?

559
00:39:07,576 --> 00:39:10,244
Gregory's spirit gave you
some pretty good information.

560
00:39:10,277 --> 00:39:13,476
That guy in the car was bad news.

561
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:15,376
I barely got there in time.

562
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,509
What happened?

563
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:19,810
He's dead.

564
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:24,043
Did you...

565
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:25,344
No.

566
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:31,010
But i'll tell you one thing.

567
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:33,010
The way he died,

568
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:35,610
If i hadn't have seen
it with my own two eyes,

569
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,509
I never would have believed it.

570
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,910
I mean...

571
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:41,910
I don't know what to call it.

572
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:46,743
What?

573
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:52,010
Dean, what did you see?

574
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:55,843
Maybe

575
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:02,543
God's will.
