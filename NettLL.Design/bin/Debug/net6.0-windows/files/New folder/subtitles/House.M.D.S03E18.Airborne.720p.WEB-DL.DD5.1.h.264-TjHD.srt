(KNOCK ON DOOR)

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,280
Fran? I'm Robin.

3
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,680
Please come in.

4
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,150
Cute home.
Two bedroom, one bath?

5
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,250
Yeah.

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,460
A guy I know collects those.
Says they're worth
a fortune on the internet.

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,630
Yeah.

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,740
You've never used
our agency before, have you?

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,540
Is it that obvious?

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
As you can see,
we offer a full range
of services.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,920
"Round the World"?
Our deluxe package.

12
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,930
Offers all the services
of A, B, and C.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,100
How much?
$1,000.

14
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,430
And satisfaction
is guaranteed. Twice.

15
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,230
I'll get the money.
I'll get ready.

16
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,780
Harrington?

17
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,380
(CAT MEWING)

18
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,660
Harrington, what are you
doing up there?

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,000
All right, now don't
take this personally
but you're gonna have to go...

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,160
Fran.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,070
Is this okay?

22
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,280
Fran.

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,810
Fran, you all right?

24
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,490
Oh, God.

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,960
Fran?

26
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,030
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at 500 North Sycamore.

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,030
I don't know,
my friend collapsed.

28
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,900
And what were you doing
when you fainted?

29
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,160
We were just...
Looking for her cat.

30
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,040
And have you
banged your head recently?

31
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,130
No.

32
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,110
Is this a motion sickness
patch?

33
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,680
I must have
forgotten to take it off.
I just got back from a trip.

34
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,990
Scopolamine can cause
dizziness and blurred vision.

35
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,830
You probably hit your head
when you fell,
and that caused the blackout.

36
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,630
I thought those patches were
supposed to prevent you
from getting sick.

37
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,220
Every drug has a side effect.

38
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,890
But it might be a good idea
to keep your eye on her

39
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,270
for the next few hours
to make sure she's okay.

40
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,500
Actually...

41
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,040
She has to get back to work.

42
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,970
Is it important?

43
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,570
We just don't like people
to be alone
after they leave here.

44
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,650
I'm fine. Really.

45
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,180
I'm...
Fran?

46
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,880
Fran?

47
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,860
I got a seizure. Code cart.

48
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,050
What's wrong with her?

49
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,560
I have no idea.

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,320
Where's House?

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,000
GIRL: I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!

52
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,440
Antique vintner's cane.
Cost me $900.

53
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,030
It had a corkscrew in it.

54
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,100
That would explain
the vintner's reference.

55
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,470
It could be used as a weapon
against the pilot.

56
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,340
Only if he's stuck
in a bottle of zinfandel.

57
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,280
You'll get it back
when we land.

58
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,610
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!

59
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,410
Give her 20 milligrams
of antihistamine.
Could save her life.

60
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,050
'Cause if she doesn't shut up
I'll kill her.

61
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,590
Delivering goodwill
to yet another continent.

62
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,920
You only forced me to
deliver a speech,
not goodwill.

63
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,790
You gave
a three-minute speech.

64
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,390
You know how much
WHO accreditation
means to the hospital?

65
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,260
Well, it may have been short,
but it had girth.

66
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,330
And the room service thing
was just spiteful.

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
I was hungry.
$300 for a bottle of wine.

68
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,270
I was thirsty.

69
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,610
$120 on video services.

70
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,940
I was lonely.

71
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,710
That's 500 in expenses
I can't justify.

72
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,650
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

73
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,910
Right.

74
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,120
Here you are, sir.
You're welcome.

75
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,550
Welcome aboard, Mr. House.

76
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,350
You're right here in 2-A.

77
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,560
Ms. Cuddy you're
in the next cabin
and to the left, 9-C.

78
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,660
No, I booked two
first-class tickets.

79
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,760
This must be a mistake.
No mistake.

80
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,070
I just arranged for
a $500 fare reduction.

81
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,770
Expense problem solved.

82
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,510
Where did you travel?
Duluth.

83
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,980
To visit my sister.
Really?

84
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,580
Is this her artwork?

85
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,490
"Fire butt"?

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,230
I was a little drunk.

87
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,230
Where were you a little drunk?

88
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,800
I turned 58 last March.

89
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,310
Same age my mother was
when she died.

90
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,740
Next week I packed a bag,
I went to JFK,

91
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,150
looked at the big board,
took the first plane
that went to a warm place.

92
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,080
Caracas.
Oh, my God.

93
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,480
Did you drink the water?
Eat salads?

94
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,420
Any raw foods.
Yup.

95
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,080
And?

96
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:45,790
I also did mescal shooters
and snorted cocaine from
a homosexual man's stomach.

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,570
Did you have sex?
No.

98
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,640
Not with him.
I had sex with El Gordo.

99
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,600
He was a large man.

100
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,840
Oh, my God.

101
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,280
I never do things like that.

102
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,060
I should have gone
to visit my sister.
It was stupid.

103
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,960
That's why I'm sick, isn't it?

104
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,060
It's possible.

105
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,930
(GROANING)

106
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,640
Here you are.
Rib eye, medium rare.

107
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,870
Thank you.

108
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,680
Some more Pinot Grigio?

109
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,680
No. I think I will
switch to the Syrah.

110
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,620
(GROANING)

111
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,090
Sir, are you all right?

112
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,430
He's drunk.

113
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,940
See?

114
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,550
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

115
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,980
Does anyone speak Korean?

116
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,150
Is anyone a doctor?

117
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,920
Yes.

118
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,660
I'll go get her.

119
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,030
(SNORING)

120
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,940
What do you want?

121
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,680
Do you really think
I was gonna leave you stuck
back here for 18 hours?

122
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,780
Go on, enjoy.

123
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,830
With the Vicodin and the wine
I could sleep anywhere.

124
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,660
Thank you.

125
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,340
We should put her back
on the scopolamine patch.

126
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,900
She can't wear
motion sickness patches
for the rest of her life.

127
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,670
No, but if it does relive
her symptoms
it'll narrow down our search.

128
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,240
Anything else
you two guys wanna agree on?

129
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,680
You have a problem
with us agreeing?

130
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,810
No, I have a problem
with the other thing
you're doing,

131
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,680
which makes me question
your motive for agreeing.

132
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,520
I'll put her
back on the patch.
What else?

133
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,250
It's gotta be something
neurological.

134
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,190
We should do a CT,
look for a brain tumor.

135
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,060
Could also be an allergy
or something environmental.

136
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,120
We should check her home.

137
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,670
Bit more likely she got
sick in Caracas
than in New Jersey.

138
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,130
Right, I forgot.
There are no toxins in the US.

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,400
I think I'm starting to
feel sorry for House.

140
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,770
Get a tox screen, chem-20,
STD panel, blood cultures.

141
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,310
Then you run a CT
and you check her house.

142
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,140
Please.

143
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,250
Not funny.

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,690
Wasn't supposed
to be funny ha-ha.

145
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,950
Fever, headache,
severe abdominal pain,

146
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,290
and a rash
all over his lower back.

147
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,350
It's serious.
Maybe contagious.

148
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,160
We just attended a symposium
on pandemics

149
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,930
and you run right into one
on the flight home.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,030
Talk about a small world.

151
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,130
If it's meningococcus,

152
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,200
half the passengers on this
plane could get infected and
die before we reach New York.

153
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,900
Is someone sick?
No.

154
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,940
Someone has a hangover.

155
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,810
He had a snootload
of Bloody Marys before dinner.

156
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,880
Watch the movie.

157
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,480
That booze did not
give him the rash.
It is textbook meningococcus.

158
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,360
It's also textbook
allergic reaction to pollen,

159
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,890
peanuts, and the semen-stained
polyester blanket
he's lying on.

160
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,090
Mr. Peng's throwing up again.

161
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,600
We have to turn around.

162
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,630
What? Why do we have to...

163
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
We don't. You misunderstood.

164
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,170
Dr. Cuddy just meant
that he might
feel less nauseous

165
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,970
if he was facing
in a different direction.

166
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,010
She didn't mean to panic
a planeload of people.

167
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,070
We're about to head
over the North Pole.

168
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,050
We don't turn back now,
the next ER's 15 hours away.

169
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,210
He'll be fine.
I'm a doctor, too.

170
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,380
You haven't examined him.

171
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,690
Korean male, mid 30s,
5'9", 160, bald,

172
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,850
scar on the right side
of his jaw, medic alert
bracelet on his left wrist

173
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,400
indicating that
he's allergic to,
at least, penicillin.

174
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,660
Without any way to do an LP
or rule out meningococcus,

175
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,460
our only choice
is to assume the worst.

176
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,730
Good point.

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,860
On the other hand, I am
a board-certified specialist
in infectious disease.

178
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,630
She assigns parking spaces.

179
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,250
Please let me know
if he gets any worse.

180
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,190
Think we should feed the cat?

181
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,330
Bowl's full.

182
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,970
If he wants it, he can get it.
Cadmium yellow?

183
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,730
Heavy metal poisoning
would explain the
ataxia and the seizures.

184
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,000
Not unless
she was painting
with her tongue.

185
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,640
Was Foreman right?

186
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,910
Did you agree with me
because of our relationship?

187
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,240
"Relationship"?
You know what I mean.

188
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,310
You mean because of
our lack of a relationship.

189
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,710
I mean, because
we're having sex.

190
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,590
Yes. Foreman's right.

191
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,830
I thought you were
completely wrong
about the medicine,

192
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,160
but agreed with you anyway

193
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,490
because I figured then
you'd do me
in some old lady's home.

194
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,930
Then well played.

195
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,130
Come on, we're supposed to be
looking for toxins.

196
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,170
We agreed
it was a brain tumor. What?

197
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,440
He's watching.

198
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,180
Haven't you had
anybody watch before?

199
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,270
Is that guy really sick?
No.

200
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,640
He's all better.
I don't believe you.

201
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,340
Look that way.
Why?

202
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,940
Because you're gonna throw up
and I don't want it on me.

203
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,950
I'll get some towels.

204
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,560
Give her a banana.
Monkey see, monkey barf.
You smell vomit...

205
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,770
Okay. Wasn't expecting that.

206
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,920
I need help.

207
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,510
Who doesn't?

208
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,850
I need someone to talk to.

209
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,590
Can you say, "Crikey, mate"?

210
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,760
Crikey, mate.
Perfect.

211
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,460
Now no matter what I say,
you agree with me, okay?

212
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,970
Okay.
Nicely done.

213
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,000
And you disagree
with everything I say.

214
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,170
Sorry. Not understanding.

215
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,710
That's close enough.

216
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,840
And you get morally outraged
at everything I say.

217
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,040
That's a permanent marker,
you know.

218
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
Wow.

219
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,450
You guys are good.

220
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,180
We are looking for
the simplest way
to explain these symptoms.

221
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,320
Organophosphate poisoning.
Some international flights
spray pesticides.

222
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,430
Could be.

223
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,130
Sorry, English not so nice.

224
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,900
Is this a joke?

225
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,460
Just passed the halfway mark.

226
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,100
Can't turn around. Nice call.

227
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,330
No worries.

228
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,930
We think it's
pesticide poisoning.

229
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,440
We don't spray these flights.

230
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,640
Dramamine overdose.

231
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,870
CUDDY: Wouldn't
explain the fever.

232
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,070
Jet lag.
Wouldn't explain
the abdominal pain.

233
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,410
Deep vein thrombosis.
Wouldn't explain the nausea.

234
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,110
Food poisoning.
What was on the menu?

235
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,450
Steak and sea bass
in First Class. Fettuccine
and seafood kebabs in Economy.

236
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,720
Since when does food poisoning
cause a rash?

237
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,820
Sea bass, seafood kebabs?
He had the sea bass.

238
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,060
Please tell me
she had the kebabs.

239
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,960
I think so.

240
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,330
Ciguatera poisoning.

241
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,960
It's an instant-onset toxin.

242
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,630
Symptoms include...
E. All of the above.

243
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,230
It's only found in
certain kinds of tropical
game fish such as...

244
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,980
Sea bass?

245
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,570
Make sure you get
a resume from him.

246
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,680
<i>Hello?</i>
Excuse me.

247
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,690
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I have a brief announcement</i>
<i>concerning your meals.</i>

248
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,390
<i>If you ate the sea bass</i>
<i>or the seafood kebabs,</i>

249
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,160
<i>you have ingested</i>
<i>a dangerous toxin.</i>

250
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,500
<i>However, if you proceed</i>
<i>to the restrooms</i>
<i>both on your left and right</i>

251
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,030
<i>at the rear of the plane</i>
<i>and vomit as soon as possible,</i>

252
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,590
<i>the toxic effect</i>
<i>should be minimal.</i>
What?

253
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,510
<i>Thank you, and have</i>
<i>a pleasant flight.</i>

254
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,840
Meningococcus makes
just as much sense.

255
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,110
I know.

256
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,960
What did you find?

257
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,000
Nothing in her house.
Big waste of time.

258
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,160
Medically.

259
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,930
CT was a complete waste.

260
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,400
She was negative for tumors,
her blood was negative
for drugs,

261
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,130
heavy metals,
tropical diseases,
food poisoning, and STDs.

262
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,440
Also no sign of
lead poisoning or sepsis.

263
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,940
Apparently Venezuelan
tattoo parlors
have standards after all.

264
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,640
Good to know.

265
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,500
We sure she's even sick?

266
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,350
Two more seizures
in the last two hours.

267
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,410
Which is slower than she was
having them before
you put the patch back on.

268
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,330
I'm an idiot. She's exposed
herself to so much crap
I just assumed it was a zebra.

269
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,530
It's breast cancer.

270
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,530
Since when is breast cancer
treatable by
motion sickness meds?

271
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,000
It's not. But the inflammation
caused by the paraneoplastic
syndrome

272
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,630
caused by the cancer
can be reduced
by anticholinergics.

273
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,910
Hey, here you go.

274
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,250
Is he gonna die?

275
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,480
We're doing all we can.
We don't know what's
wrong with him yet.

276
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,820
Am I gonna die?

277
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,020
No.

278
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,060
Here, chew on these.

279
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,940
Good news is all the pilots
are red meat men.

280
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,700
Although I was kind of
looking forward to
landing this puppy myself.

281
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,430
Peng's getting worse.

282
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,770
That makes sense.

283
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,310
First Class ate before Coach.

284
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,440
He digested more of his food
before he threw up.

285
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,110
Or you're wrong and we're
gonna start seeing
neurological symptoms soon.

286
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,620
Seizures, paralysis, ataxia.

287
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,450
We're not gonna see ataxia.

288
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,790
You're so sure you're right.
No.

289
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,200
It's just hard to show
clumsiness when you're lying
moaning in a fetal position.

290
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Hey, stand up.

291
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,670
Does nobody
speak Korean on this flight?

292
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,870
I assumed you did.

293
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,970
I know how to ask him
if his sister's over 18,

294
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,170
I just don't think
that's gonna help.

295
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,810
Hey, stand up. Stand up.

296
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,620
Don't play the cripple card
with me.

297
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,740
Oh, hi. I'm leaving.

298
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,100
Work.

299
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,270
Okay.

300
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,410
Important client.
Sure.

301
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,250
Listen.

302
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,200
Are you close?

303
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,430
Why?

304
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,360
She needs a mammogram.

305
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,870
Oh, God.

306
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,540
I know I'm throwing
a lot at you. She just
has no family in town.

307
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,210
And I really think
she could use a friend
right now.

308
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,090
Okay. Put your hand here.

309
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,730
You don't have to stay.

310
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,270
No, it's no problem.

311
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,430
But why?

312
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,410
You don't even know me.

313
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,270
You gotta be scared.

314
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,710
I almost hope
it's breast cancer.
No.

315
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,250
Then it wouldn't be my fault.

316
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,480
Whatever it is,
it's not your fault.

317
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,620
That's not true.
You can control things.

318
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,750
Not everything.

319
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,420
But you don't have to
take stupid risks.
I was being an idiot.

320
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,990
You were having fun.

321
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,140
You have regrets?

322
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,200
Yeah.

323
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,470
<i>CAMERON.: Robin?</i>

324
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,610
Hold still.

325
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,850
Good.

326
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,120
Okay, we're gonna get
just one more.
I'm sorry, I know it hurts.

327
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,690
It's not that.

328
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,200
It's my eye. My right eye.

329
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,140
I can't see.

330
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,880
It's definitely ataxia.
And it's definitely a rash.

331
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,580
You gonna look at it for five
more minutes before concluding
it's also definitely a leg?

332
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,710
Thin leg.

333
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,280
It's been in a cast.
So?

334
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,650
So it could be
radiation poisoning.

335
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,880
From a broken leg?

336
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,290
From the x-rays
they took of it.

337
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,760
He could break
every bone in his body

338
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,130
and still not have
enough x-rays to cause
radiation sickness.

339
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,630
Unless those x-rays
were performed in Wankoff,
North Korea,

340
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,290
by a third-grade dropout
with a 50-year-old imager.

341
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,170
Which accounts
for the absence of fur.

342
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,400
Radiation poisoning accounts
for all his symptoms.

343
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,170
I have hair.
I haven't had an x-ray since
I got my teeth whitened.

344
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,800
You're pregnant.

345
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,940
I'm what?

346
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,040
Explains the nausea,
abdominal pains, fever,

347
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,520
and why you're stuffing
your 36Cs into a 34B bra.

348
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,780
CUDDY: And her rash?

349
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,850
PUPPPs. Common pregnancy rash.

350
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,950
I can't be pregnant.

351
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,250
You a virgin?

352
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,350
No, but...

353
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,020
You're pregnant. Mazel tov.

354
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,230
Let's get him into the chair.

355
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,430
Two different diagnoses.

356
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,300
I thought you didn't
believe in coincidences.

357
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,060
I believe in statistics.

358
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,300
Two hundred passengers
on the plane,
10 should be gay,

359
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,000
two should be with child,
and one should be
incredibly annoying

360
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,010
with an extra ass chromosome.
House.

361
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,310
Get him some iodized salt
to protect his thyroid.
I'm going back...

362
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,510
House.

363
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
You're wrong.

364
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,140
I said we should have
turned back. You should
have listened to me.

365
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,970
Now we're eight miles
over the Arctic...

366
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,880
I'm trying to listen
to you now, so shut up.

367
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,080
Heart's fine.

368
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,950
Breasts are firm.

369
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,220
Is it contagious?

370
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,190
A lot of the passengers
are scared.

371
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,520
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.

372
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,390
Is there something
to worry about?
Yeah.

373
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:54,020
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.
And get me a flashlight.

374
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,070
Cover your left eye with this.

375
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,820
Photophobia.

376
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,980
Symptom of meningitis.
We need antibiotics.

377
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,420
I'll call down
to the pharmacy.

378
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,720
You're creeping me out.

379
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,030
Then get me a lab.

380
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,070
Pseudomonas smell yeasty,
staph smells musty,

381
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,230
and some liver disease
smell of ammonia.

382
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,940
House. I'm not in heat.

383
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,130
Citrus-y on the nose
with a blush of
toasted coconut.

384
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,760
I need to get a better look
at your rash.

385
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,160
Use your imagination.

386
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,130
Fine, should I go with
Lifeguard Cuddy
or Mother Superior Cuddy?

387
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,260
Three more passengers
are sick.

388
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,360
If we don't get drugs,
we're gonna have
a lot of dead passengers.

389
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,310
Blindness in her right eye
indicates it's not
breast cancer.

390
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,510
It's likely neurological.

391
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,380
I just met her today.

392
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,290
You should go.

393
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,890
She needs someone here.

394
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,730
That's not your job.

395
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,220
Please let me know
that she's okay.

396
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,830
It's just sex.

397
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,230
There's no such thing.

398
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,740
Other eye.

399
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,470
Are you saying women
can't separate the physical
from the emotional?

400
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,670
No one does it well,
women do it worse.

401
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,970
You just want us to stop
because you think
it's affecting...

402
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,570
Me. Yeah.

403
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,310
Polyspikes are over 01 and 02.

404
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,940
That's her left eye.

405
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,180
Burst suppression
on every lead.

406
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,650
Fran?

407
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,930
She's comatose.

408
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,170
HOUSE: Nothing. Nothing.

409
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,860
Nothing.

410
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,670
Come on, nobody has no meds!

411
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,040
Excuse me.
Open your mouth.

412
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,550
Where's the acyclovir?

413
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,020
I'm not on any meds.

414
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,320
Well, you better get some.
You've got herpes.

415
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,630
What do you know?
He's got some.
This must be your lucky day.

416
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,500
This is for real.
People are sick.

417
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,640
Some of us will be
deplaning in body bags
unless you cough up.

418
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,910
MAN: Here. Over here.
Thank you. Thank you.

419
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,370
Thank you.

420
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,480
God bless you.

421
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,690
Her brain is shutting down
because of
intracranial pressure.

422
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,950
Or her nerves are dying.

423
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,460
Because of
the increased pressure.

424
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,580
She has a bleed in her brain.

425
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,850
You said the CT showed...

426
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,920
No tumors. But if she has
an AVM leading to
a cerebral hemorrhage,

427
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,190
we could've missed it.
She needs a burr hole
to relieve...

428
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,400
You wanna drill into her brain
because of an invisible bleed
the CT couldn't see?

429
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,940
We should do an LP
to confirm the presence
of red blood cells.

430
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,440
And her brain herniates
and then she dies.

431
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,500
Right. Better to kill her
in the OR.

432
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,810
Chase, what do you think?

433
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,370
Here's a cliffhanger.

434
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,450
I think it would help to know
what she has before we
start digging into her brain.

435
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,390
Might be better to
play it safe to start.
Do an LP.

436
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,130
Sex better be damn good.

437
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,960
Lot of apples,
not many candy bars.

438
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,440
Any antibiotics?

439
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,970
Three caps of Augmentin.

440
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,270
For six patients.

441
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,610
Give them to Peng.

442
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,150
He's allergic to penicillin.

443
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,310
The First Aid kit
has two epi pens.

444
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,910
If he has a severe reaction,
10 epi pens won't save him.

445
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,220
You take the pills.
He's worse.

446
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,720
He's a guy who doesn't
speak English.

447
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,090
Give him the meds.

448
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,820
If it's not meningitis,
we're risking his life and
flushing meds down the toilet.

449
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,330
Then do an LP on him.
If it's clear, you win.

450
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,130
If it's cloudy he gets
the Augmentin.
And we risk a reaction.

451
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,730
Sounds like a plan.
All except for the part where
we don't have an LP needle.

452
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,210
And the shaking of the plane
means I'll probably pierce
his spinal cord

453
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,270
and cripple him for life.
But, I mean,
it totally sounds like a plan.

454
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,290
You're right. Let him die.
Give me the meds.

455
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,060
Got it.
Damn.

456
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,740
What is it?

457
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,900
Shut up. Don't get hysterical.

458
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,210
Just tell me
what the hell it is.

459
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,410
House. We should have
turned back.

460
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,720
We should have turned back.

461
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,410
House.

462
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,560
Hold this.

463
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

464
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,060
<i>we have a passenger with</i>
<i>a confirmed case</i>
<i>of bacterial meningitis.</i>

465
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,510
<i>Unless we land</i>
<i>as soon as possible, the</i>
<i>passenger will not survive.</i>

466
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,880
<i>It's very likely that</i>
<i>some of you have been</i>
<i>infected as well.</i>

467
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,940
<i>As soon as you start feeling</i>
<i>symptoms, we need to isolate</i>
<i>you in First Class cabin.</i>

468
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,920
<i>Fever, rash, nausea,</i>

469
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,590
<i>and in the late stages</i>
<i>tremor in the left hand.</i>

470
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,820
I've got that.
Oh, God.

471
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,830
What do we do?
WOMAN: It's really bad.

472
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,430
Break out the bubbly.

473
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,610
Yo, listen up.

474
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,310
<i>The bad news is, you have</i>
<i>an illness. The good news is</i>
<i>it's not meningitis.</i>

475
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,690
<i>It's not fatal,</i>
<i>it's just embarrassing.</i>

476
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,280
<i>It's conversion disorder,</i>
<i>more commonly known</i>
<i>as mass hysteria.</i>

477
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,130
<i>It happens often in</i>
<i>high-anxiety situations,</i>
<i>especially to women.</i>

478
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,430
<i>I know it sounds sexist,</i>
<i>but science says you're weak</i>
<i>and soft. What can I do?</i>

479
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,490
CUDDY: House, you're wrong.

480
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,900
Look at my hand.

481
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,900
Yeah. Look at her hand.

482
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,380
Shaking left hand.
What is that a symptom of?

483
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,180
Not meningitis. It's basically
a symptom of nothing.

484
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,680
I put the idea
into their heads
and watched it happen.

485
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,780
Same thing Peng cruelly did
with the puking and the rash.

486
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,150
The rash is in my head?

487
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,280
Your mind controls your body.

488
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,920
If it thinks you're sick,
it makes you sick.

489
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,560
It just started.

490
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,890
<i>If you'll all just calm down,</i>
<i>your symptoms</i>
<i>will soon go away.</i>

491
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,490
<i>And to facilitate</i>
<i>this process,</i>

492
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,800
<i>your flight crew will move</i>
<i>through the cabin with</i>
<i>a complimentary bar service.</i>

493
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,240
<i>Thank you and, as always,</i>
<i>have a pleasant flight.</i>

494
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,580
Still feel like puking?
No.

495
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,400
How did you know?

496
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,590
LP was negative.

497
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,170
I came up with
an alternate theory
and I tested it.

498
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,030
Couldn't have done it
without you. Rage is
a symptom of mass hysteria.

499
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,540
Just one more thing
to clean up. Peng set off
the mass hysteria.

500
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,150
What set off Peng?

501
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,050
He really is dying.
Yeah.

502
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,490
I haven't the
faintest idea why.

503
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,400
What's extension pasturing?

504
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,960
It's when you're molested
by a priest's cousin.

505
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,010
Do we really need these three?

506
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,710
Worried they'll make you
look bad?

507
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,370
Could be symptomatic
of head trauma,
cerebral infarction,

508
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,680
or intracranial hemorrhage.
Thoughts?

509
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,350
How long until we land?

510
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,550
Too long to wait.

511
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,020
His head's as smooth
as a baby's bottom, no bumps.

512
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,420
So I think we can
rule out head trauma.

513
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,790
But you gotta choose between
what's left, a clog or a leak?

514
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,560
You're talking of toilet?

515
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,330
House, is this
actually helpful?

516
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,870
Not so far.

517
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,800
What about syphilis?

518
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,570
Well, first of all, he
apparently speaks a language
no one else speaks,

519
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,010
which makes talking up
the ladies a little rough.

520
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,240
We're flying out of Singapore.

521
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,980
If he has a credit card
and a condom,
he can get anything he wants.

522
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,280
What?

523
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,890
Condoms.

524
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,660
He has focal limb paralysis.

525
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,000
His legs got paralyzed
by a condom?

526
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,620
No, by cocaine.

527
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,200
It was inside the condom.

528
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,970
It's now spreading
through his digestive tract.

529
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,010
You think he's a mule.

530
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,700
I think he's a jackass.

531
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,900
We're gonna have to operate.
Cool!

532
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,060
They're gonna kill her.
We were wrong.

533
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,070
Which means Foreman was right.

534
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,900
Maybe Foreman's
right about us, too. Maybe
we should just stop all this.

535
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,340
I mean, if it's
affecting our jobs.

536
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,350
It's not affecting our jobs.

537
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:50,710
We had sex in a patient's
bedroom. A bedroom
we were examining for toxins.

538
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,680
Yeah, our judgment's right
on the mark.

539
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,810
All right. No more sex
in patient's homes, no more
sex with cats watching.

540
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,410
Anywhere else you wanna
cross off the list?

541
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,690
The bowl.
What?

542
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,520
Has she eaten
since she's been here?

543
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,290
She's been sick
since she's been here.

544
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,230
What if it's a symptom?
Well, why would you think...

545
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,000
The bowl was full.

546
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,750
You're gonna need to
hold him down.
He's not gonna like this.

547
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,540
Do you really think
he's a mule?

548
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,990
Fits the symptoms.

549
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,230
You sure he's not contagious?

550
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,420
Pretty much.

551
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,430
You can't be pretty much sure.
Means you're not sure.

552
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,190
Oh, aren't you clever?

553
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,860
Come on.

554
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,030
I know you're pretty much
unconscious,

555
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,670
but as has been pointed out
to me, pretty much
doesn't mean squat.

556
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,100
Okay, hold him tight.

557
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,150
The faster we do this,
the less likely he is
to die of shock.

558
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,820
Tighter.

559
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,230
Sorry.
Do that again.

560
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,530
Ease off and then press down.

561
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,760
Pressure on his joints
relieves his pain.

562
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,960
Okay.
Wrong again.

563
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,640
Where's his wallet?

564
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,030
Scuba certification card.

565
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,770
Big deal. I have one of these.
Yeah.

566
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,570
But do you also have a receipt
from Tekong's Scuba Rental
dated yesterday?

567
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,050
Tell the Captain to
drop as low as he can,
under 5,000 feet.

568
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,420
We're at 38,000...
Peng's got the bends.

569
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,580
He went diving yesterday.

570
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,520
Like an idiot,
he surfaced too quickly,
and like a bigger idiot,

571
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,820
he boarded a flight which is
pressurized to 8,000 feet
above sea level.

572
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,520
Low pressure is killing him.

573
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,460
Tell the pilot to dive until
we can club baby seals
out of the window.

574
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,000
And get him some oxygen.

575
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,350
Fifty years ago, it was
one estate. The two homes
shared an electrical system.

576
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,580
Unfortunately,
the exterminator
didn't know that,

577
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,420
so when they fumigated
next door,

578
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,250
the poison gas flowed
through the old pipe
and into your house.

579
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,390
The scopolamine patch
was masking the effects
of the poison.

580
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,800
You'll have to stay here
for a few more days, but
after that you should be fine.

581
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,300
I'm sorry about your cat.

582
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,470
And your hair.

583
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,570
For 12 years, Harrington
never left the property.

584
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,540
I thought I was being punished
for going away,

585
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,120
but really I was being
punished for coming home.

586
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,410
Thank you.
I saved your life. You owe me.

587
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,510
I wasn't sick.

588
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,820
But you didn't know that.
You owe me.

589
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,320
I know it now.

590
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,060
Your mind convinced your body
to get a rash, photophobia,
vomit.

591
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,150
How do you know it wouldn't
have shut down your cold,
cold heart next?

592
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,430
I don't owe you.

593
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,270
You're mean.

594
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,340
That's how I compensate
for being weak and soft.

595
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,510
I just wanted to
say thank you.

596
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,140
You're extremely welcome.

597
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,950
And I'm in New York
every Monday.

598
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,790
Are you handicap accessible?

599
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,730
Hi, Robin?

600
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,700
This is Dr. Wilson.

601
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,570
Fran's doctor. James.

602
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:04,250
It was a toxin.
We caught it in time,
and she's gonna be fine.

603
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,050
Yeah, it is.

604
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:16,090
Listen, I was just wondering
if you were coming back in
again to visit.

605
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,860
Nice catch.

606
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:20,960
Thanks.

607
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,400
Think even House
would be impressed.

608
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,160
I don't know about that.

609
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,330
Any idea how
you wanna celebrate?

610
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,800
What?

611
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,240
I want more.

612
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,810
I thought
you were getting a little
worn out by...

613
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,710
No, that's not what I meant.

614
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,110
I know.

615
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:43,350
I was just hoping you'd
take the hint and pretend
you never said that.

616
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,350
I want this to be
more than it is.

617
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,120
I thought we were clear.

618
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,290
In the beginning,
but you can't tell me...

619
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,660
Yes, I can. And I don't.

620
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,830
It was fun. That's it.

621
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,810
And now it's over.
