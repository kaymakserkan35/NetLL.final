Bob, what's wrong?

00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,220
What happened? Talk to me.

did I wake you up?

Excuse me for actually
caring what I look like.

28
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:03,624
I think the word you're
looking for is obsessing.

29
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:05,478
Been at it for almost an hour.

30
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:07,686
If you wanted in,
all you had to do is say so.

31
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:10,024
I don't want in.
I want sleep.

you got up anyway.
It's almost 9:00.

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,934
You. Staying here.

00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,291
What, you think
we should try counseling first?

39
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,921
Why do you want to
sleep on a couch anyway?
You got money.

At least until
the divorce is finalized.

Bob:
It was three days ago.

44
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,782
My throat got really dry
and then my tongue felt like
it was blowing up like a balloon.

45
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,923
I assume somebody checked
for food allergies?

46
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,543
Well, the first two doctors, both did.

47
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:10,120
Next one said it was a panic attack.
The one after that
wanted to take his tonsils out.

48
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,946
The last one had no idea.
He just referred us to Dr. House.

49
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:16,872
It says the attack was
preceded by some sort of
strenuous physical activity.

50
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,580
Um...yeah.

51
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:19,994

52
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:27,453
Awesome.

53
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,487
A sex fiend
with a swollen tongue.

54
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:33,457
Just think of all the places
I can make Foreman search.

55
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,638
He's not a sex fiend.
He's a happily married man.

56
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,318
No such thing.

57
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,273
What're you doing?

58
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:49,816

00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,533

which could cause choking.

I didn't see  any sign of trauma,
and they were remarkably open.

64
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:09,588

they admitted participating in
a threesome a few months ago.

Hundred bucks says
they're as miserable
as the next couple.

67
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,285
Girl.
His wife's college roommate.

68
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,613
If he's not happily married,
I don't know who could be.

69
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,132
They're looking for something.

70
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,022
If you're happy,
you got nothing to look for.

71
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,418
His wife arranged it
for an anniversary present.

72
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:30,097
And if you ask me,
if two people really
trust each other,

73
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:33,158
a threesome
once every seven years
might actually help a marriage.

74
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:39,017
Okay, I say we stop the DDX
and discuss that comment.

75
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,005
I'll take the bet.

76
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:46,858
Maybe the first doctor was right.
A food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.

77
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:50,668
Could be neurological.
Progressive Bulbar Paralysis
would explain the symptoms.

78
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:53,891
No. ALS would affect
his facial muscles
before his throat.

79
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,901
What if the problem's
not in his throat?

80
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:59,117
That'd be a little odd considering
that's where all his symptoms are.

81
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:00,844
- Says who?
- The patient.

82
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:04,800
Since most patients can't tell
their ulna from their anus,

83
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:09,361
I'm guessing this guy also
doesn't know the difference
between choking and suffocating.

84
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:11,686
His throat might be fine.
His lungs might be messed up.

85
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,069
Get more blood, a chest CT,
and a body plethysmograph.

86
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,393
Unless of course, you think
we should be asking the patient
where his anus is first.

87
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:25,308
It, uh, feels like I have to urinate,
and then when I try to go--

88
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,372
Pull up your pants.

89
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,403
- It's my prostate, isn't it?
- Nope. Not your prostate.

90
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:34,470
Herpes.

91
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:35,821
Herpes?

92
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:36,861
Herpes.

93
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,538
Your  turn.

94
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:43,070
If it makes you feel any better,
half the patients who come into this place
have some sort of crotch rot.

95
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:45,250
Uh, no, it doesn't.

96
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:48,826
Look, this is impossible.
I've been married for 20 years.

97
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,990
You had any sex
in those 20 years?

98
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:53,504
- Yes, of course--
- Then that's how you got it.

99
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,673
The only person
I've had sex with is my wife.

100
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,095
Bummer.

101
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:03,276
Take this once a day.
Tell your wife to do the same.

102
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,260
It's not gonna cure it, but it'll lessen
the frequency of the outbreaks.

103
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,379
But there must be some mistake.

104
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:09,710
You got any kids?

105
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,397
Yeah.

106
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,544
Any of them take guitar lessons?

107
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:13,771
No.

108
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:15,467
Tennis, art, acting?

109
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:17,941
My daughter does karate. Why?

110
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:20,732
Give this to her sensei.

111
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,805
Oh, wait.
Does your wife play tennis?

112
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,721
No.

113
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:27,852
That's what I figured.
It never hurts to make sure.

114
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:30,831
[Rip of paper]
For Miyagi.

115
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,710

I need you to pant. Kind of like a dog.

116
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:40,777
[Pants]

117
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:42,879
That's  good. Keep going.

118
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,858
Can I ask you
a personal question?

119
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,595
Uh, I guess.

120
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:59,433
The, um...the threesome.
And...the role playing.
Is that because things get boring?

121
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:01,977
No.

122
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:07,137
We just...enjoy our fantasies.

123
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,901
- You married?
- No.

124
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:17,411
You can go back to taking
the deep breaths now.

125
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,168
Marriages don't fail
because couples get bored.

126
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,546
They fail because...

127
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:29,027
while they're dating, people pretend
to be the person they think
their partner wants and then....

128
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:33,068
Well, there's only so long
you can keep that up.

129
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,044
Maybe they are that person
while they're dating,
but then they change.

130
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,959
People thinking their partner will change?
That's another reason marriages fail.

131
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,537
People don't change.

132
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:50,136
At least not in any way
that really matters.

133
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,695
I think you've had
enough caffeine.

134
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:02,029
You were right.
It's not his throat. It's his lungs.

135
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:04,231
Plethysmograph  revealed
decreased lung capacity.

136
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:06,190
And the CT showed lung scarring.

137
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:10,857
It's definitely
interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
What's not definite is the cause.

138
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:15,247
There's no arthritis, no sarcoidosis.
Uh, he's not on any prescription meds.

139
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:19,258
And he's a wedding photographer
so I doubt he got exposed to
coal dust or asbestos at work.

140
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,804
Cause could be idiopathic.

141
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,004
Can't be idiopathic.
Idiopathic means
without a known cause.

142
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:24,900
What I meant was that--

143
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:26,945
What you meant was
you don't know what the cause is.

144
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,012
Just say that, and
we can avoid this conversation.

145
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,132
No applause?

146
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:36,504
- What's his current condition?
- Stable.

147
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,555
- Then we can wait.
- Wait for what?

148
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:41,445
For whatever you can't figure out
to cause something else.

149
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,530
You know it's going to.

150
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:48,042
It's possible the IPF could
just continue to--
[Beepers go off]

151
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,282
There's something wrong
with his skin.

152
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:56,318
Okay, stop scratching.
I gotta look at it.

153
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:57,904
I can't!
This is driving me crazy.

154
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:58,989
Stop scratching so--

155
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,625
- Make it stop!
- Okay--

156
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,043
Make it stop!

157
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:04,652
Make it stop.

158
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,760
Now we got something to discuss.

159
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,140
What causes both lung scarring
and the itchy splotchy red blotchies?

160
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:21,716
It's obviously not
a reaction to medication.
We haven't given him any yet.

161
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:26,796
Right. But what besides
what it's obviously not can cause
both lung scarring and the splotchies?

162
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,796
Where are you going?

163
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:31,390
To complete the second half of
the caffeine delivery system.

164
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,530
Either talk louder
or get in here!

165
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,941
Same color coming out as going in.

166
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,443
You think that's
a marketing thing?

167
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,062
Lupus could cause
lung scarring and a rash.

168
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:50,804
Or it could still be
a food allergy.

169
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,330
We've already
ruled out allergies.

170
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:54,018
Did we?

171
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:55,331
Where's Cameron?

172
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:57,091
We're in the men's room.

173
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:00,092
We need an allergy expert in here!

174
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,375
This can wait two minutes.

175
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:06,569
You don't know that.

176
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:09,635
Chase thinks that food allergies
should still be on the table.

177
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,219
No, it wouldn't explain
the lung scarring.

178
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:15,553
Some homeopathic studies have found
a connection between food allergies
and autoimmune reactions,

179
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:16,981
which could cause lung inflammation.

180
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:21,620
Yeah. And some homeopathic studies
have also found that
ground-up spiders can cure cancer.

181
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:22,987
Can I go now?

182
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,099
No.

183
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:29,645
Lungs, skin. Skin, lungs.

184
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:31,470
Sklungs?

185
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,105
Lungs, skin.

186
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:38,205
Throat.

187
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,357
Heavy metal toxicity.

188
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:46,385
It explains the lungs, the itching,

189
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,344
the swelling in
his tongue and throat.

190
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:52,486
I thought you didn't believe
there was anything wrong
with this throat.

191
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,183
I never said
I didn't believe it.

192
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,389
I just said
I had good reason to doubt it.

193
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:57,482
And now?

194
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,414
And now I have good reason
to doubt those doubts.

195
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,246
Patient's a little old to be
chewing paint off the walls.

196
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,024
Nor does he drink well water or eat fish
every day or do anything else that
could've exposed him to heavy metals.

197
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:10,151
He and his wife worked a wedding
in Cabo San Lucas last month.

198
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,408
A lot of pottery in Mexico is
contaminated with lead-based paint.

199
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:15,078
Now aren't you glad
you joined us?

200
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:19,398
Search their house and screen
his blood and hair for lead.

201
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:22,468
And test for mercury and arsenic
while you're at it.

202
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:23,743
Chase.

203
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,506
Find out what the resort cooks with,
and if they have repainted recently
or did any plumbing repairs.

204
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,554
I don't speak Spanish.

205
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,822
Then it'll be challenging.

206
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:45,209
Good Lord.

207
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:47,353
What is that smell?

208
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,363
Stuffed pepper.

209
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,336
Stuffed with what?

210
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:53,881
Vomit?

211
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,464
Thought you were
going to a hotel.

212
00:13:05,614 --> 00:13:07,084
I found an apartment.

213
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,400
I can move in on Monday.
Is that fast enough for you?

214
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:10,609
What's today?

215
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,110
Where'd you get all that stuff?

216
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,960
Well, not from your kitchen.

217
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:21,097
Don't you ever eat anything besides
canned soup and peanut butter?

218
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:26,276
Don't you eat anything that
doesn't look like it's been rolled
onto your plate by a dung beetle?

219
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:30,449
Try it.

220
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:38,026
It's good, isn't it?

221
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:39,518
No.

222
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:42,088
Just better than it looks.

223
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:47,995
How much beans and rice do you think
you'd have to eat from a ceramic pot

224
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,237
painted with lead-based paint
to get enough lead into your system
to damage your lungs?

225
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:53,919
Are we talking a child or an adult?

226
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:55,037
Adult.

227
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:56,321
Then I'd say a lot.

228
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:59,887
You'd have to beans
every day for months.

229
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:03,954
Now, why do you have a season pass
to the New Yankee workshop?

230
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,916
It's a complete moron
working with power tools.

231
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,838
How much more
suspenseful can you get?

232
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:11,491
- I'm--I was watching something.
- No...

233
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,306
You were about
to watch something.

234
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,437
I'm watching something.
See the difference?

235
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,837
If the water was contaminated,
wouldn't I be sick too?

236
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:23,554
People can metabolize toxins
at different rates.

237
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,368
We'll test it to be sure.

238
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:29,610
- Have you done any
recent renovations?
- No.

239
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,624
Have any problem
with bugs or rodents?

240
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,683
Just the occasional ant.

241
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:37,364
Use bug spray?

242
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:39,747
No. I hate the smell.

243
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:43,895
Luckily both of us are pretty anal
about keeping things clean.

244
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,521
Yeah, I can tell.

245
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,465
You think ants are the problem?

246
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:01,938
Can you stop stuffing your mouth
with pancakes for one second?

247
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:05,098
These aren't pancakes.
These are macadamia nut pancakes.

248
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:07,195
Wilson made 'em
and they're amazing.

249
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:11,687
- She said she doesn't
use bug spray, but--
- Silver dollar slices of heaven.

250
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,213
- Some ants are poisonous. Maybe--
- Forget the 72 virgins.

251
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,262
If I blow myself up
in a crowded restaurant,

252
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,794
I'm gonna be asking
for a plate of these babies.

253
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:22,492
Is the ant big and red
or small and black?

254
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:23,621
Medium and brown.

255
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:26,406
Halle Berry brown
or Beyoncé brown?

256
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:27,905
Is there a difference?

257
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:30,969
Is there a difference?

258
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:36,417
Army ants could devour, dissolve,
eat a cow in a matter of hours.

259
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,886
Australian bull ants on the hand

260
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:44,144
are nasty little bastards, but they're
more of a nuisance than a threat.
No surprise there.

261
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,605
Beyoncé.

262
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,354
Well, then that's not it.

263
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,817
How much clay did
he eat at the resort?

264
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:53,446
It's a five-star, 400-a-night place.
They don't cook with ceramic pots.

265
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,150
Tox  screen?

266
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:56,446
No evidence of lead,
mercury, or arsenic.

267
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,537
Run 'em again.

268
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:00,729
Call the resort.
Find some disgruntled
employee to talk to.

269
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:02,858
- Go back to the home--
- It's not heavy metals.

270
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,111
- The symptoms say it is.
- The tests say it's not.

271
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:07,137
Well, who you gonna believe?
The symptoms or the tests?

272
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,979
Could also be a food allergy.

273
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:10,207
Cameron says it's not.

274
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,302
If your tests can be wrong,
why can't hers?

275
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:15,880
His diet hasn't changed
since he was a kid.
His favorite foodis Corn Flakes.

276
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:20,302
Which I assume he eats with milk,
one of the most common
adult onset food allergies.

277
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:23,364
Start treating him for lead poisoning.
It's the most likely heavy metal.

278
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,995
And yeah,
you can test him for allergies
for dairy, wheat, and legume.

279
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:39,537
I am not having an affair with
my daughter's karate instructor,
and I did not give my husband herpes.

280
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,494
Found out where House is.

281
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:49,193
If you're convinced it's allergies,
why're you giving him drugs
to treat lead poisoning?

282
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:51,111
We're not convinced
of anything, yet.

283
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:53,351
I think I need something else.
This cream isn't working.

284
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,197
We're doing everything we can.

285
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:57,723
Ow!

286
00:16:57,944 --> 00:16:58,530
Sorry.

287
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,836
No, no, it's not my back.
It's my feet.

288
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:03,475
I think I stepped in something
when I went to the bathroom.

289
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:05,950
Uh, it's on my socks.
It's burning!

290
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,341
I don't see anything.

291
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:11,583
Bob:
Please take my socks off.

292
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:12,999
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

293
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:17,259
Ow! Stop. Stop, stop!

294
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,729
What did you just
scratch him with?

295
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:22,408
If there was an allergic reaction,
it'd be on his back, not on his feet.

296
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:24,839
Oh, God, it's burning!
Please make it stop.

297
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,577
Gonna need some
gabapentin in here.

298
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:33,645
Excruciating pain
in the lower extremities.

299
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,926
Not a sign of a food allergy.

300
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,611
Means there's
a neurological problem.

301
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:41,669
More significantly,
it's yet another classic sign
of heavy metals.

302
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:47,961
And I just did yet another hair and blood test
for lead and everything else he could possibly
have been exposed to. They're all negative.

303
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:49,172
It's gotta be something else.

304
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:50,849
- Lupus could cause--
- No.

305
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:53,925
Lupus progresses slower.
There'd be joint pain.

306
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,836
So it's not a typical case.

307
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:58,686
- We should get an ANA--
- It's not lupus.

308
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,066
Symptoms don't match.

309
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,376
And the tests don't match
heavy metals.

310
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:06,556
[Beepers go off]

311
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:15,538
Maria:
It's happening again.
He's not breathing!

312
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:21,045
Tongue's swelling,
airways closing.
He's not getting any air.

313
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:23,174
- His lungs are clear.
- We're gonna have to intubate.

314
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,668
Try to relax, Bob, this is
gonna help you breathe.

315
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:26,909
Oh, my God!

316
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,733
He's gonna aspirate.
Need suction!

317
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:29,514
What's happening?

318
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:30,710
Suction.

319
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,771
There's too much vomit.
We're never going
to be able to intubate.

320
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,107
We need to trach him.

321
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,677
He's not breathing.

322
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,745
Foreman:
His urine has elevated
proteins and red blood cells.

323
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:04,939
It's lupus-induced kidney failure.
If we don't start treatment--

324
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:07,057
Heavy metal toxicity
could cause vomiting.

325
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:10,022
And so would lupus nephritis,
and it also causes tissue swelling.

326
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,143
He's choking on his tongue,
not his feet.

327
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:15,886
The corticosteroids we gave him
to control the inflammation
can cause facial swelling.

328
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:18,173
It's still not his throat,
but you're getting closer.

329
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,525
I'm doing an ANA and
a serum compliment.

330
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:24,436
If you're so sure,
why waste time with tests?
Just start treatment.

331
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,189
Oh, no, wait, we can't do that
because we already have and
it's not working. Ergo--

332
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:31,380
Corticosteroids aren't
the only treatment
for lupus nephritis.

333
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:34,989
We could also try
cyclophosphamide or
immunosuppressants.

334
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:41,304
Only if we confirm the diagnosis with
an ANA, serum compliment, anti-DNA,
IV pyelogram, and kidney biopsy.

335
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,156
So  now you suddenly
believe in tests?

336
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,316
- The symptoms--
- The symptoms all point
to heavy metal poisoning.

337
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:48,901
Yeah, we all get it.

338
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:52,335
Unless you've got proof and
can tell me which heavy metal it is,

339
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm starting treatment for lupus.

340
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:06,394
Systemic lupus erythematosus
causes the immune system
to become hyperactive.

341
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:08,027
Attack normal tissue.

342
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,699
It could be what caused
the lung inflammation

343
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:14,968
as well as the swelling in his throat
and now what appears to
be damage to his kidneys.

344
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,426
The treatment's
usually steroids.

345
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,224
But he's already on steroids.

346
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:22,692
If the tests confirm we're on the right track,
there are other medications we can try.

347
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:23,906
And if those don't work?

348
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:28,469
Well, lupus is a chronic condition,
but it's generally controllable.

349
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,648
What do you mean, generally?

350
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:35,032
In rare cases, it can cause
cardiovascular or renal failure.

351
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,755
Cardiovascular and...

352
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:41,573
renal. That's, uh, the heart
and the kidneys, right?

353
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,698
Yeah.

354
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:58,132
[Hoarsely]
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

355
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,375
Enjoying the salad?

356
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:14,985
There's no lettuce.

357
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:16,707
I'm aware that
there's no lettuce!

358
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,727
Do you know when
I obtained this knowledge?

359
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,672
Actually, I'm in the middle of--

360
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:20,842
When I made it.

361
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:22,410
For myself.

362
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:25,086
Well, how was I supposed to know?

363
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:30,067
Well...I was hoping--
This might tip you off.

364
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:32,179
That's kind of selfish.
Don't you think?

365
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:34,412
I offered to make you some.
You said no.

366
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:36,653
Ah, that was before
I tasted the pancakes.

367
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,682
It's a compliment,
you should be flattered.

368
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:40,844
Here.

369
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,992
It's Mrs. Lambert's
herpes test results.

370
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,248
Mrs. who?

371
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,870
You've told more than one patient
his wife is sleeping with
his daughter's karate teacher?

372
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,737
You wanna stir the pot,
you have to clean up the mess.

373
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,467
What would you do
if you got herpes?

374
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:57,382
She's coming in at 5:00,
don't make me come looking for you.

375
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,891
Actually, I know what you'd do.
But I mean a normal guy--

376
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:05,656
And don't be calling in sick, or saying
that your team needs you for
some kind of emergency consult.

377
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:11,177
If he suspected that maybe his wife
had also been playing pickle games,
he could just keep it on the down low.

378
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,999
At least wait
till she got infected.

379
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,310
You'd give your own wife herpes
just to shift the blame onto--

380
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,273
Oh, he'd give his own mother herpes
if it got him out of clinic duty.

381
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,146
Of course, maybe it was the wife.

382
00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:23,350
Maybe she was the one who--

383
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,582
Where's Mrs. Nympho?

384
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,084
She's waiting outside. Why?

385
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:33,147
Go search her.

386
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:34,929
What, you mean
her medical records?

387
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:38,270
If I meant that,
good chance I'd have said that.

388
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,055
You think she's poisoning him?

389
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:46,005
His symptoms should be getting
better the longer he's here.
Instead they're getting worse.

390
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:49,949
So either she's poisoning him or--
It's not heavy metals.

391
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:52,529
We've done over ten different
heavy metal tox screens--

392
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:55,095
Because there's no reason
to test for the other 30.

393
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:58,495
They don't get into the air or food.
They only get in you
if someone puts them in you.

394
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,246
And the only way we're going to find out
what she's been sprinkling on
his corn flakes is to search her.

395
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:06,933
I am not going to accuse a woman
of trying to murder her own husband
based simply on some paranoid theory.

396
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,486
It's the only explanation.

397
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:10,271
We've eliminated
every other possibility.

398
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,319
We have not eliminated
every other possibility.

399
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:14,077
Has he responded to
the latest lupus treatment?

400
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:15,372
He's only been on it
for a few hours.

401
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:17,363
He hasn't responded
because it's not lupus.

402
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,122
It's not allergies, ALS,
arthritis, or sarcoidosis.

403
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,897
She's all that's left.

404
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:25,653
Do it!

405
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,635
Hi.

406
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:34,089
I'm Dr. House.

407
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,942
Mind if I take a lookin your purse?

408
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:38,470
Why?

409
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:44,020
Because I'm going to need to search it
and you for whatever you're using
to poison your husband.

410
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:47,408
Why would I want
to hurt my husband?

411
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:50,844
Then you won't mind
if I search your things.

412
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,684
Go ahead.

413
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:07,803
You satisfied?

414
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:11,418
Absolutely not.

415
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:14,746
She agreed to let me
search everywhere else,
but this she says no to.

416
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:15,831
Doesn't that tell you something?

417
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:20,188
Yes, that she doesn't want
some lunatic doctor searching
her vagina with a flashlight.

418
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,184
Oh, Cameron could do that.

419
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:22,152
I'm not going to--

420
00:24:22,236 --> 00:24:24,163
The woman hasn't left
the hospital since they arrived.

421
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,205
Whatever she's using, she's
obviously hiding somewhere.

422
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,626
She's not poisoning him.

423
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,718
It's the only explanation.

424
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,728
No, it's the only explanation
your twisted mind can come up with

425
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:34,848
because you're angry that
you can't find the answer,
and you're taking it out on her.

426
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:38,762
And you are protecting
a complete stranger based on
some childishly romantic notion that

427
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:41,139
people are all so happily married
they don't want to kill each other.

428
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,245
You calling me childish?

429
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:42,795
Grow up.

430
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,716
Shut up.

431
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:46,845
Both of you.
And stay away from his wife.

432
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:49,877
Sorry. I'm not giving you
permission to assault someone.

433
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:12,834
Let's see. I'm thinking

434
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:17,153
Colonel Mustard
in the music room
with the candlestick.

435
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:20,615
There's no music room.
It's the conservatory.

436
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:22,421
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

437
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:27,804
If we don't find out what she's using
and start treatment immediately,
he'll be dead in a week.

438
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:28,997
If you're right.

439
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:32,394
If Foreman's right,
you'd have basically raped
an innocent woman.

440
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,409
My wife fired the maid.

441
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:44,645
Apparently she's getting rid of
everything that reminds her of me.

442
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,438
You did your maid?

443
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:51,158
I was nice to our maid,
which...annoyed her.
God knows why.

444
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:52,516
Maybe she was doing her.

445
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:55,206
No one was doing her.
All right?

446
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,977
But, you still
feel responsible.

447
00:25:57,084 --> 00:26:00,905
Even though nothing
or no one was done,
it's still your fault.

448
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:05,334
I offered to keep paying her salary
until she found another job.

449
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:09,448
But she refused to take any money
without doing any work, so--

450
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:12,752
If you want someone to
clean your apartment,

451
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:13,907
It's on me.

452
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:16,598
You're supposed to moving out,
not moving more people in.

453
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:19,178
She's not moving in.
She's gonna clean.

454
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,778
Maybe I should just move out,
and the the two of you could--

455
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:22,556
Oh, God!
[Machine beeps]

456
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:24,342
- Oh, God, no.
- Call a code!

457
00:26:25,757 --> 00:26:27,331
Please.

458
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:31,768
Charge it to 360.
Give him epi.

459
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:34,456
Clear!

460
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:37,374
Still no pulse.

461
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,355
Charging. Clear!

462
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,782
I got a pulse.

463
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,269
Pupils are reactive.

464
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,465
You still with us?

465
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:49,317
He was without oxygen
for less than a minute.
It can't be hypoxia.

466
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:50,730
Could be a stroke.

467
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,860
Honey, can you hear me?

468
00:26:53,123 --> 00:26:53,808
Back up.

469
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:56,002
Bob, talk to me. Bob?

470
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:57,941
Honey, please.

471
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:01,448
Bob, can you hear me?

472
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:05,251
He's awake.

473
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,283
Can you hear me?

474
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:09,755
Honey?

475
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:15,197
[Whispers] Hi.

476
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,436
Yes. She is...
quite the little actress.

477
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:28,787
So, let's say she's
not poisoning him.

478
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:30,683
There's nothing more to discuss.

479
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,710
We've got lungand kidney failure,
neurological symptoms,
and now cardiac arrest.

480
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,192
A systemic disease with
multi-organ involvement
is the definition of lupus.

481
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:39,772
Autoimmune suppressants
aren't helping.

482
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:42,905
We should start him
on cyclophosphamide.
See if it makes a difference.

483
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:46,253
Yeah. And interferon.

484
00:27:46,312 --> 00:27:49,163
Interferon isn't an approved
treatment for lupus.

485
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,041
You're not still thinking--

486
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:53,469
Interferon isn't
an approved treatment for
heavy metal toxicity either.

487
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:57,844
True. But it's pretty much
the only thing we can do
for a viral infection.

488
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:00,886
We didn't consider it because--

489
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,860
Because it doesn't make sense.
There's no fever.

490
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,995
Because he's got
no immune system.

491
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:08,060
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribe for lupus treatment.

492
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,531
He didn't present
with a fever either.

493
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:12,926
Because at that point, he was
a post-viral autoimmune reaction.

494
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:13,760
Which again--

495
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:17,739
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribed for lupus treatment,

496
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:20,153
his immune system basically
rolled out the red carpet

497
00:28:20,237 --> 00:28:24,128
for the dormant virus, waking it up,
turning it into a present viral infection.

498
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:25,675
Give him interferon.

499
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:29,156
But if it is lupus,
interferon could make it worse.

500
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:30,691
Suppress his bone marrow
even further.

501
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,438
Which is more likely?

502
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:35,041
A rapidly progressing, acute-onset lupus
in a patient who's already on steroids,

503
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,894
or a team of doctors
missing a post-viral reaction?

504
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:39,426
We didn't miss anything.

505
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:44,970
Well then, I'm wrong
and you shouldn't--
Give him interferon!

506
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,018
Intravenous interferon has
been shown to be effective
against some viral infections.

507
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:55,343
But, I thought you said
it wasn't an infection.
You said it was lupus.

508
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:59,445
The increasingly rapid
progression of the symptoms
has caused us to reconsider.

509
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,616
And what if you're wrong here too?

510
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:03,275
What if it's not a virus?

511
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,462
There are risks
with interferon.

512
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:08,710
Especially in a patient who's
already immunosuppressed.

513
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:13,791
Look, at this point, you're lungs,
kidneys,and heart are all failing.

514
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:16,608
We really don't have any choice.

515
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:53,341
[Hoarsely] I cheated.

516
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:55,308
What?

517
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:59,831
9th grade...
earth science.

518
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:01,911
Mr. Foley.

519
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:06,917
I sat behind you
so I could cheat off of you.

520
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:14,807
And I let you cheat...
so you'd sit behind me.

521
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:19,992
I thought we were gonna
grow old together.

522
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,436
In 9th grade?

523
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,367
No. 10th.

524
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:29,992
What, you had to make sure
I put out first?

525
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:33,112
No.

526
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,366
I knew you put out
in the 7th grade.

527
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:44,731
I love you.

528
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:50,462
Yeah, I know.

529
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,758
Say you love me.

530
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:56,638
No. [Crying]

531
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,469
Why not?

532
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:03,887
Because...you're not dying.

533
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:07,211
Say it anyway.

534
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:12,412
You gonna make me hurt you?

535
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,551
I love you.

536
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:34,040
Foreman:
It's not working.

537
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,959
Both his lungs and kidneys
are continuing to deteriorate.

538
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,109
- Up the dose.
- We already have.

539
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:41,186
Apparently not enough.

540
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:42,445
I don't think it's a virus.

541
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,265
We've been running titers
for everything we could think of.
They're all negative.

542
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,723
[House's beeper goes off]

543
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:53,022
Increase the interferon.

544
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:53,846
House.

545
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:56,802
You got a better idea?
Other than lupus?

546
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,629
No.

547
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:00,319
Then up the dose.

548
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:03,560
Mr. and Mrs. Lambert's appointment
was over an hour ago.

549
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:07,841
Sorry. I was sick.
And my team needed
an emergency consult.

550
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:14,716
Your wife has herpes.

551
00:32:15,177 --> 00:32:16,557
What?

552
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:18,976
That-- That's impossible.
I don't have any--

553
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:21,505
You haven't had
an outbreak...yet.

554
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,145
Don't worry, you will.

555
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:26,196
You rutty jackass!

556
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:29,417
Me? I haven't been
with anyone in 20 years!

557
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:30,976
But you're the one
with the blisters on his--

558
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,992
Doesn't mean
that he got it first.

559
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,159
You don't need to have
an outbreak to spread the virus.

560
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:38,666
Yeah! And you're the one always
talking about wanting more sex.

561
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,677
From you.

562
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:42,890
And maybe I'd get more
if you weren't actually
getting it somewhere else.

563
00:32:42,974 --> 00:32:45,017
Well, you two obviously
have a lot to talk about.

564
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:46,801
Don't even think about
dumping this on my lap.

565
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:49,757
There's gotta be someway
to prove that it's him.

566
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:51,881
I'm sorry. There is no test.

567
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:54,779
Either you two ever
sit on a public toilet?

568
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,250
Well?

569
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:58,534
Of course.

570
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:01,764
Herpes can live
for short periods of time
outside the body.

571
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,351
Dr. House, you know
you can't get herpes--

572
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:07,718
Some politically correct doctors
will tell you that it's impossible
to get infected by a toilet seat,

573
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:12,209
but they'll also tell you not to use
the same bath towel to dry your crotch
and your face during an outbreak.

574
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:13,179
See the contradiction?

575
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:15,288
I always use a paper cover.

576
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,488
- Always?
- Yes, of course.

577
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:18,579
What about you?

578
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:20,130
No.

579
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:22,313
I never knew.

580
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:25,328
Oh, please.
This is ridiculous.

581
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:28,434
Damn.
I was sure it was Miyagi.

582
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:29,273
What?

583
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:32,732
He could believe that you can
get herpes from a toilet seat, or

584
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:35,745
he could be cheating on you
and just be happy to have an out.

585
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:37,754
The toilet seat
makes sense, doesn't it?

586
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:42,150
Sure, but she'd only refused
to believe such a well presented lie
if she were innocent.

587
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:46,041
And since you both
can't be innocent...
You rutty jackass.

588
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,297
Oh, you--

589
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:50,946
- Thanks a lot.
- My pleasure.

590
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,781
Honey. Wait! Please.

591
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:55,075
Wow.

592
00:33:57,762 --> 00:33:59,454
Not bad.

593
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:11,043
She has a family history
of arthritis, doesn't she?

594
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,592
Yeah, she does.
What does--?

595
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:14,954
Stop the interferon.

596
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,861
Do another heavy metal screen.
Only this time, test for gold.

597
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:19,754
You don't still think that she--

598
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:21,382
And don't let her
go to the bathroom.

599
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:24,010
Why would you care if she--
[House hangs up]

600
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,317
Hello?

601
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:05,941
Ho!

602
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:07,205
Hi.

603
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:08,973
I'm Lady.

604
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,635
What'd you do to my closet?

605
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,715
I cleaned it.

606
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:15,711
Uh, Dr. Wilson said
that I could go ahead--

607
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:18,116
It's not Dr. Wilson's closet!

608
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:21,802
Where's the wood box?

609
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:24,292
- A wood box?
- Yes, the wood box.

610
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:26,191
It's made of wood,
and it's box-shaped.

611
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,650
It's been in the back of thiscloset since the day I moved in.

612
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,647
I didn't seeany kind of wood--

613
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:33,715
You may not have seen it,
but you've obviously moved it.
The question is where?

614
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,818
Well, I did not move anything, I just--

615
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:39,659
Look, it was in this closet.
Then you came.
Now it's not in this closet.

616
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:42,413
Okay, uh--What type of box?

617
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:43,889
Wood! Wood!

618
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:47,365
It's a brown wood box.
It's got a metal handle on the top.
It looks like a--

619
00:35:47,422 --> 00:35:49,045
like a tackle or a toolbox.

620
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:51,314
Ah, you mean the chest?

621
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:53,360
The one that's under the bed?

622
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:13,186
Do you need to fix something?

623
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,787
Um. Thanks.

624
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:31,893
Well, fine, then I'll go
to one on another floor.

625
00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:34,512
Well, actually, they're
not working there either.

626
00:36:35,837 --> 00:36:38,734
Every bathroom
in the whole hospital
is out of order?

627
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:42,165
Well, they're,
um--The water--

628
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:44,740
I'm going to the bathroom.

629
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,195
Where is she?

630
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,676
She had to go to the bathroom.

631
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:53,709
- I told you not to let her.
- What was I supposed to do?

632
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,253
- Tie her up?
- Why not? She likes that.

633
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,228
What are you doing?

634
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,759
Uh, your hand is wet.

635
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:16,545
Sorry. Must be nervous.

636
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,471
I got some bad news.

637
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:21,233
What?

638
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,555
The damage to your husband's
lungs is permanent.

639
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,902
The kidney damage is reversible,
and with the right therapy,

640
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:31,220
he should regain
full neurological function.

641
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:36,130
Other than the fact that he's not
gonna be running any marathons,
he should be fine.

642
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:39,246
But that's good news, isn't it?

643
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,847
I'm not finished.

644
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:47,827
When I was a kid,
my dad was stationed
in a Marine base in Egypt.

645
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:52,129
We were in the middle of nowhere,
and there was absolutely nothing
for a kid to do except...

646
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:53,785
look for a mummy's tomb.

647
00:37:53,845 --> 00:37:57,461
You didn't want me
to go to the bathroom
because you wanted to tell me

648
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:02,258
my husband is going to be fine
and that...you used to live in Egypt?

649
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:04,874
I didn't have a problem
with you going to the bathroom.

650
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,747
I just didn't want you
to wash your hands.

651
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:13,129
I never actually found a mummy.

652
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:16,312
But, I did learn a fair amount
about the ancient Egyptians.

653
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:21,540
For example, they discovered
that stannous chloride is not only
great for toughening ruby glass,

654
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:25,521
but if it's mixed with gold,
it turns bright purple.

655
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:37,279
Now either, your fingers actually
are worth their weight in gold,

656
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:42,219
or you've been sprinkling
your husband's cereal
with gold sodium thiomalate.

657
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:47,222
It's an arthritis remedy that
it's rarely used here in the in the U.S.,
but it's still popular in Mexico.

658
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,589
Gotta give you props.

659
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:54,119
I've never heard of
anyone using gold before.

660
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:59,993
It's almost...poetic.

661
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:03,097
It's ridiculous.

662
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:06,660
Heavy metal tox screen
for gold was off the chart.

663
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:10,851
Why would I--

664
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:12,845
Because you were
trying to kill him.

665
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,518
I'd love to know
the why behind that why.

666
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,213
But, you're not gonna
tell me, are you?

667
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:23,404
You're wrong. I--

668
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:27,734
I love Bob.

669
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,239
I never said
you didn't love him.

670
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:38,290
How does somebody do that?

671
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:43,845
Sit by someone's bedside day and night,
helping them, comforting them,
and at the same time killing them.

672
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:45,767
Maybe he was
having an affair.

673
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:47,729
Maybe she was
having an affair.

674
00:39:47,837 --> 00:39:52,398
Or maybe she just gets her kicks out of
slowly sucking the life out of a guy,
watching him suffer.

675
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:54,272
He must've done something to her.

676
00:39:54,455 --> 00:39:55,671
Yeah, he had it coming.

677
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:56,994
I didn't say he deserved it.

678
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:59,812
The only thing he did wrong
was marry a sociopath.

679
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:02,678
Or maybe she just got
tired of being married.

680
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:08,926
Didn't want to admit to family and friends
that the marriage everyone thought
was perfect wasn't.

681
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,135
Shouldn't of us stay with her?

682
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,356
What is she tries to run?

683
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,754
Yeah. Cameron,
go back there.

684
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:17,988
It'd be weird if we were
all in the ladies' room.

685
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:50,709
Cameron:
We started chelation therapy
with dimercaprol.

686
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:54,738
Thrilled to hear it.

687
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:58,096
His kidney function
hasn't improved.

688
00:40:58,307 --> 00:40:59,773
It will.

689
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,506
He's gonna need
a lung transplant.

690
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,408
He's becoming more attractive
by the minute, isn't he?

691
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:10,856
You're pleased.

692
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,862
You think you've proved
every marriage is a mistake.

693
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:17,202
Do I look pleased?

694
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:40,363
Ignorance is bliss.

695
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:53,141
