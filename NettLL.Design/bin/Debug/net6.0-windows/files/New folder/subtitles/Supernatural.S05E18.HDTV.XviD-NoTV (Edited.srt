1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,901
I was on the fast track once.

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:06,101
Employee of the month,
every month. Forever.

3
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:07,901
And then they assigned me you.

4
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:10,001
I can't close the
deal on a couple

5
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:11,901
of pathetic flannel wearing maggots.

6
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,101
Everybody's laughing at me.

7
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:15,570
We're John Winchesters sons.

8
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,637
I've got brothers?

9
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:17,838
Adam doesn't have to be cursed.

10
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,807
He's a Winchester.
He's already cursed.

11
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:25,566
You're not Adam.
You've never been Adam.

12
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,102
You're a ghoul.

13
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:30,439
You can't kill the devil
and you're losing faith

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,437
in yourself, your brother.

15
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:34,306
God was your last hope.

16
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:35,606
Are you gonna do
something stupid?

17
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:36,840
Like what?

18
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,074
Like Michael stupid.

19
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:40,208
Whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't do it.

20
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:41,608
I have to.

21
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:57,374
Let me guess.

22
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,544
Pink-slipped?

23
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:00,947
That obvious, huh?

24
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:04,383
Takes one to know one.

25
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:07,253
"Outsourcing."

26
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:12,124
What was your crime
against humanity?

27
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,728
Deal of the millennium.

28
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,464
Couldn't even get the one
simple "yes" I needed.

29
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:23,033
Got to nail that
bottom line, right?

30
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,134
Hear that.

31
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:26,704
All they care about
upstairs, ain't it?

32
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,708
Results, results, results.

33
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,042
They don't know.

34
00:01:30,043 --> 00:01:32,347
They're not down on
the ground, in the mud,

35
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:34,916
Nose to nose with all
you pig-filthy humans.

36
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:35,852
Am I right?

37
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:37,720
Absolutely... filthy what?

38
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:40,758
I mean, whatever happened
to personal loyalty?

39
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,560
How long have I worked
for these guys?

40
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,328
Five millennia? Six?

41
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,097
Seems like it, don't it?

42
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:47,665
Damn straight, it does.

43
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,433
Two more.

44
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:53,670
Zach.

45
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,838
Stuart.

46
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:57,207
What are you gonna do next, Stuart?

47
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,709
Hell, I don't know.

48
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,344
Maybe something to
do with the Internet.

49
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:02,978
Yeah?

50
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:08,351
Whoa.
Earthquake?

51
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:11,355
No.

52
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:12,658
My boss.

53
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,163
Ah!

54
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:20,199
Aah!

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,834
Aaah!

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,842
Go ahead...

57
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:31,111
get it over with.

58
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm ready.

59
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,423
Wait

60
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:41,657
What?

61
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:44,360
Yes! Anything, of course.

62
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,062
Just... just put me back in.
You won't regret it.

63
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,467
Thank you.

64
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:54,770
Thank you!

65
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:10,084
Ah.

66
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:15,424
Back in business, boys!

67
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:18,424
"Oh when the saints go marching in"

68
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,424
"Oh when the saints..."

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
  Season 5 Episode 18
  "Point of No Return"

70
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,585
Sending someone
a candy-gram?

71
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,259
How'd you find me?

72
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,328
You're gonna kill
yourself, right?

73
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:57,832
It's not too hard to figure out
the stops on the farewell tour.

74
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,134
How's Lisa doing, anyways?

75
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,869
I'm not gonna kill myself.

76
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,771
No?

77
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,639
So, Michael's not about
to make you his Muppet?

78
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,111
What the hell, man?
This is how it ends?

79
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:13,547
You just... walk out?

80
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,483
Yeah, I guess.

81
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,751
How could you do that?

82
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,152
How could I?

83
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,722
All you've ever done
is run away!

84
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,859
And I was wrong every
single time I did.

85
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,199
Just... please...

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,667
not now.

87
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,069
Bobby is working
on something.

88
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,471
Oh, really... what?

89
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,242
You got nothing,
and you know it.

90
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,783
You know I
have to stop you.

91
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,457
Yeah, well, you can try.

92
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,927
But just remember,

93
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:02,163
you're not all hopped up
on demon blood this time.

94
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:03,698
Yeah, I know...

95
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,368
but I brought help.

96
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,481
Yeah, no,
this is good, really.

97
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:22,717
Eight months of turned pages
and screwed pooches,

98
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:25,586
but tonight... tonight's
when the magic happens.

99
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:26,921
You ain't helping.

100
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:29,689
Yeah, well, why don't you let me
get out of your hair, then?

101
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,693
What the hell
happened to you?

102
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,961
Reality happened.

103
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,296
Nuclear's the only option
we have left.

104
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,798
Michael can ice the devil,
save a boatload of people.

105
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,299
But not all of them.

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,902
We got to think
of something else.

107
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,805
Yeah, well, that's
easy for you to say.

108
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,440
But if Lucifer burns
this mother down

109
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,209
and I could have done
something about it,

110
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,544
guess what... that's on me.

111
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,345
You can't give up, son.

112
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,218
You're not my father.

113
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,423
And you ain't in my shoes.

114
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,349
What is that?

115
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,986
That's the round I mean
to put through my skull.

116
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:38,058
Every morning,
I look at it,

117
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,827
and I think...

118
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:43,397
"maybe today's the day
I flip the lights out."

119
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:46,734
But I don't do it.

120
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:48,703
I never do it.

121
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:50,204
You know why?

122
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:54,875
Because I promised you
I wouldn't give up!

123
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,686
Cass, you okay?

124
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:07,920
No.

125
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,023
What's wrong?

126
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,124
Somethings happening.

127
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,692
Where?

128
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,322
I'm gonna get a beer.
Do you mind?

129
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,498
Help.

130
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,666
Boys!

131
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,141
Who is it?

132
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,911
That's our brother.

133
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:07,875
Wait a minute.
Your brother... Adam?

134
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,743
Cass, what the hell?

135
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:13,179
Angels.

136
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,448
Angels... why?

137
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:18,550
I know one thing
for sure.

138
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:21,953
We need to hide him now.

139
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,799
- Where am I?
- It's okay.

140
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,166
Just relax.
You're safe.

141
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,901
Who the hell are you?

142
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:40,571
You're gonna find this a little...

143
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:44,074
a lot crazy, but we're
actually your brothers.

144
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:45,510
It's the truth.

145
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,979
John Winchesters our father, too.

146
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,013
See, I'm Sam.

147
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:50,214
Yeah, and I'm sure
that's Dean.

148
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,286
I know who you are.

149
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:56,455
- How?
- They warned me about you.

150
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:58,590
- Who did?
- The angels.

151
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,095
Now, where the hell
is Zachariah?!

152
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:08,898
So, why don't you just
tell us everything?

153
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,300
Start from the beginning.

154
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:18,306
Well, I was dead
and in heaven...

155
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:24,145
except it... it, uh,
kind of looked like my prom.

156
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:26,481
And I was making
out with this girl.

157
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:28,349
Her... her name
was Kristin McGee.

158
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,017
Yeah, that sounds like heaven.

159
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:31,819
Did you get to third base?

160
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,524
Just, uh... just keep going.

161
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:39,593
Well, these... these angels,
they popped out of nowhere,

162
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,695
and they tell me
that I-I'm chosen.

163
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:42,929
For what?

164
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,531
To save the world.

165
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,666
How you gonna do that?

166
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:50,335
Oh, me and some archangel
are gonna kill the devil.

167
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,570
What archangel?

168
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,771
Michael.

169
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,740
I'm his, uh, sword
or vessel or something.

170
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,774
I don't know

171
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,110
Well, that's insane.

172
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,146
Not necessarily.

173
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,182
How do you mean?

174
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,351
Maybe they're moving
on from you, Dean.

175
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,154
Well, that doesn't make sense.

176
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,090
He's John Winchesters bloodline,

177
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,092
Sam's brother.

178
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,561
It's not perfect,
but it's possible.

179
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,029
You got to be kidding me.

180
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,197
Why would they do this?

181
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,765
Maybe they're desperate.

182
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,000
Maybe they've
wrongly assumed

183
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,568
Dean would be brave enough
to withstand them.

184
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,436
All right, you know what?
Blow me, Cass.

185
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,438
Look. No way.

186
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,941
After everything
that's happened.

187
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,309
All that crap
about destiny,

188
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,943
suddenly the angels
have a plan "B"?

189
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,045
Does that smell right to anybody?

190
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,981
You know, this has been
a really moving family reunion,

191
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,748
but, uh,
I got a thing, so...

192
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:41,084
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Sit down.

193
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:42,620
Just listen, okay?

194
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:45,623
Please.

195
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,195
It's unbelievable.

196
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,935
Now, Adam...

197
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:58,571
The angels
are lying to you.

198
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,406
They're full of crap.

199
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,409
Yeah, I don't think so.

200
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,644
Really? why not?

201
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,312
Um, 'cause they're angels.

202
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,949
They tell you they were gonna
roast half the planet?

203
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,818
They said the fight might
get pretty hairy,

204
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:12,986
but it is the devil, right?

205
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:14,622
So, we got to stop him.

206
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:16,523
Yeah, but there's
another way.

207
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:19,593
Great. What is it?

208
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:21,828
Well, we're working
on the power of love.

209
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,864
- How's that going?
- Not good.

210
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,000
Look, Adam...

211
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,603
you don't know me from a hole
in the wall, I know...

212
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:31,604
but I'm begging you.

213
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,673
Please, just trust me.

214
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:35,942
Give me some time.

215
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,743
Give me one good reason.

216
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,881
Because we're blood.

217
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,951
You got no right
to say that to me.

218
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,087
You're still John's boy.

219
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,755
No, John Winchester
was some guy

220
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,857
who took me to a
baseball game once a year.

221
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,091
I don't have a dad.

222
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:59,761
So, we may be blood,
but we are not family.

223
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:01,630
My mom is my family...

224
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,568
and if I do my job,
I get to see her again.

225
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:09,005
So, no offense, but she's the
one I give a rat's ass about,

226
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:10,239
not you.

227
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:16,346
Fair enough.

228
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:22,219
But if you have one good memory
of dad... just one...

229
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,321
then you'll give us
a little more time.

230
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,589
Please.

231
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:03,626
Going somewhere?

232
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,766
Out for a... beer.

233
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:12,069
Great, we got beer.
Have a seat.

234
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,371
Great.

235
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:18,042
You know, you pitch this whole
dewy-eyed romance thing...

236
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,444
but the truth is,
I'm on lock-down, aren't I?

237
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,717
Adam...

238
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:29,620
you may not believe it,

239
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,388
but dad was trying
to protect you...

240
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:32,689
keeping you from all this.

241
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,858
Yeah, well, I guess
the monster that ate me

242
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:35,993
didn't get that memo.

243
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,462
You remember that?

244
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,896
Oh, yeah.

245
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,033
Still, trust me.

246
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:46,003
The one thing worse
than seeing dad once a year...

247
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,638
was seeing him all year.

248
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,240
Do you know how full
of crap you are?

249
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,742
- What?
- Really.

250
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,045
You see, it was me and
it was my mom, that's it.

251
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:58,248
She worked the graveyard
shift at the hospital.

252
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:01,317
I cooked my own dinners,
I put myself to bed.

253
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,586
So, you can say whatever
you want about our dad,

254
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,822
but the truth is,
I would have taken anything.

255
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,059
All right?

256
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,962
Look, if we had known
we had a brother...

257
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,097
Well, you didn't, so...

258
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,899
We would have found you.

259
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,236
Look, I can't
change the past.

260
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:20,938
I wish I could.

261
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,340
But from here on out...

262
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:24,608
What...

263
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,309
we gonna hop in
the family truckster?

264
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,911
Pop on down
to Wally world?

265
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:32,815
Tell you one thing...

266
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,617
attitude like that,

267
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:38,021
you'd fit right in around here.

268
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:57,771
Well, Cass, not for nothing...

269
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,840
but the last person
who looked at me like that...

270
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:01,107
I got laid.

271
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:05,245
Uh, why don't you, uh,
go keep an eye on Adam?

272
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:12,452
Is this really necessary?

273
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:15,689
Well I mean,
we got our hands full, Dean...

274
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,824
a houseful of flight risks.

275
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:19,793
I'm not letting him do it.

276
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,694
- Who, Adam?
- No, I'm... I'm not, either.

277
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:23,095
No, you're not getting me.

278
00:18:23,096 --> 00:18:27,065
Oh, no, no,
I "get" you perfectly.

279
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,800
But I'm not letting you do it either.

280
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:37,842
That kid's not taking a bullet for me.

281
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:39,643
- Dean...
- I'm serious.

282
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:43,915
I mean, think about how many
people we've gotten killed, Sam.

283
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:48,186
Mom, dad...

284
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:51,757
Jess, Jo, Ellen...

285
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,493
should I keep going?

286
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:55,862
It's not like
we pulled the trigger.

287
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:57,497
We might as well have.

288
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:01,902
I'm tired, man.

289
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,940
I'm tired of fighting
who I'm supposed to be.

290
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:12,612
Well, do you think maybe
you could take a half a second

291
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:14,881
and stop trying to sacrifice
yourself for a change?

292
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:16,616
Maybe we could actually
stick together?

293
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:18,619
I don't think so.

294
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,953
Why not?

295
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:22,522
Dean, seriously.

296
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:24,057
Tell me... I-I want to know.

297
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:28,462
I just...

298
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:29,897
I-I don't believe.

299
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:31,132
In what?

300
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:37,239
In you.

301
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,446
I mean, I don't...

302
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:48,316
I don't know whether
it's gonna be demon blood

303
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:51,853
or some other demon
chick or what, but...

304
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,957
I do know they're gonna
find a way to turn you.

305
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:00,727
So, you're saying
I'm not strong enough.

306
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:04,431
You're angry... you're self-righteous.

307
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,700
Lucifer's gonna wear you
to the prom, man.

308
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,134
It's just a matter of time.

309
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:09,369
Don't say that to me...

310
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:12,972
not you...

311
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,441
of all people.

312
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,310
I don't want to...

313
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:22,248
but it's the truth.

314
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,350
And when Satan takes you over,

315
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:27,353
there's got to be
somebody there to fight him,

316
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:30,322
and it ain't gonna be that kid.

317
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:34,893
So, it's got to be me.

318
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:56,950
How's he doing?

319
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:02,822
How you doing?

320
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:22,639
Dean?

321
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:28,679
Dean?

322
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:44,196
Cass.

323
00:22:23,663 --> 00:22:24,997
Where's Cass?

324
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,933
Blown to Oz.

325
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:29,068
Look, I'll get Dean.

326
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:30,803
He couldn't have
gone too far.

327
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:33,139
- Just watch Adam.
- How?

328
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,208
You may have noticed, he's got
a slight height advantage.

329
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:37,144
Then cuff him to your chair.
I don't know.

330
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:39,413
Just watch him.

331
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:02,004
Your mom's not coming, you know.

332
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:08,077
This is the park

333
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:10,512
where your mom took you
on her day off, right?

334
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:14,516
She's not coming...
not yet.

335
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:19,454
But she will... soon.

336
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:23,391
You're Zachariah, right?

337
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,426
I am.

338
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:28,095
You weren't where you
were supposed to be, kid.

339
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,563
Yeah, I know.

340
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:32,065
Can't quite zero in
on you, either.

341
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:35,069
So, let me take
a wild guess...

342
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,038
you're with Sam and Dean?

343
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,840
Yeah.

344
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:43,645
Didn't we tell you
about them?

345
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:47,449
So, you know you can't
trust them, right?

346
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,985
You know Sam
and Dean Winchester

347
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:53,921
are psychotically, irrationally,
erotically codependent

348
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:55,490
on each other, right?

349
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:58,425
I don't know.

350
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,761
They said a few things about you.

351
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,564
Really?

352
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:06,400
Trust me, kid.
When the heat gets hot,

353
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:08,368
they're not gonna give
a flying crap about you.

354
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,403
Hell, they'd rather
save each other's sweet bacon

355
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:11,637
than save the planet.

356
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,110
They're not your family.

357
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,079
Understand?

358
00:24:25,018 --> 00:24:27,019
Now...

359
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,121
you want to see
your mom again or not?

360
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:39,165
The end is nigh!

361
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,435
The apocalypse is upon us!

362
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:44,305
The angels talk to me,

363
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:46,974
and they asked me
to talk to you!

364
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:48,709
- The apocalypse...
- Hey!

365
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:52,514
I'm Dean Winchester.
Do you know who I am?

366
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:54,015
Dear God

367
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,283
I'll take that as a yes.

368
00:24:55,284 --> 00:24:57,185
Listen, I need you to pray
to your angel buddies

369
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,720
and let them know
that I'm here.

370
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:02,792
Our father,
who art in heaven.

371
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,494
Hallowed be thy name.

372
00:25:04,495 --> 00:25:06,062
You pray too loud.

373
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,334
What, are you crazy?!

374
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,902
I rebelled for this?!

375
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,339
So that you could
surrender to them?

376
00:25:22,877 --> 00:25:24,478
Cass! Please!

377
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:29,481
I gave everything for you.

378
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:31,049
And this is what
you give to me.

379
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,501
Do it.

380
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:56,373
Just do it!

381
00:26:14,694 --> 00:26:17,495
Bobby, what do you mean,
"Adam is gone"?

382
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:19,563
Should I say it in Spanish?

383
00:26:19,564 --> 00:26:20,864
He's gone how?

384
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:23,299
What the hell, Bobby?!

385
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,533
Watch your tone, boy

386
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:25,968
He was right in front of me,

387
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:28,870
and he disappeared
into thin air.

388
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:32,007
Because the angels took him.

389
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,642
What the hell
happened to him?

390
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,143
Me.

391
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,049
What do you mean,
the angels took Adam?

392
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,318
You branded his ribs, didn't you?

393
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,553
Yes. Adam must have tipped them.

394
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:49,155
- How?
- I don't know.

395
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:50,590
Maybe in a dream.

396
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:52,826
Well, where would they
have taken him?

397
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:07,741
I see you and your brother
share the same refined palate.

398
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,344
Ah.

399
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:13,081
So, uh...

400
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,315
we ready?

401
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:16,351
For what?

402
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,786
What do you mean,
for what? For Michael.

403
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,822
Oh.

404
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:22,324
Right...

405
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:23,859
about that.

406
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,895
Look, this is never easy,
but I'm afraid...

407
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:30,099
we've had to terminate
your position at this time.

408
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Excuse me?

409
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,335
Hey, don't get me wrong,

410
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:35,603
you've been a hell of a sport,
really... good stuff.

411
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:36,837
But the thing is,

412
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:41,108
you're not so much
the "chosen one" as you are...

413
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,210
a clammy scrap of bait.

414
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:45,178
No, but what about the
stuff that you said?

415
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,713
I'm supposed to fight the devil.

416
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:48,081
Mm, not so much.

417
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:49,482
Hey, if it's
any consolation,

418
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:51,485
you happen to be the
illegitimate half brother

419
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:52,853
of the guy we do care about.

420
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:54,855
That's not bad, is it?

421
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:56,289
So, you lied...

422
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,858
about everything.

423
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:59,193
We didn't lie.

424
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:01,128
We just avoided certain truths
to manipulate you.

425
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,362
Oh, you son of a bitch.

426
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:03,764
Hey, how do you think I feel?

427
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,266
I'm the one that's got to put up

428
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,301
with that dumb, slack-jawed
look on your face.

429
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:12,007
Kid, we didn't
have a choice.

430
00:28:12,008 --> 00:28:14,676
The Winchesters
got one blind spot,

431
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:16,011
and it's family.

432
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:19,247
See, Sam and Dean, they're gonna
put aside their differences...

433
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:21,082
and they're gonna
come get you-

434
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:25,420
and that is gonna put Dean
right... here.

435
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,822
Right where I need him.

436
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,692
This is the night, kid!

437
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,393
Our night.

438
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:33,895
Michael's seen it.

439
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:36,597
The tumblers finally
click into place

440
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:38,699
and it's all
because of you.

441
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,767
And me. But who's keeping score?

442
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,769
Yeah, I'm not gonna
let you do this.

443
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,937
Cool your jets, Corky.
Sit down.

444
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:46,171
We're doing it together.

445
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:48,040
Plus, you still
get your severance.

446
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,242
You still get
to see your mom, okay?

447
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:53,377
Why should I believe you?

448
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,848
You know what?

449
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:58,883
I keep hearing this.

450
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:01,251
But what I want to
be hearing is this...

451
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:02,485
Yeah.

452
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:05,555
That's better.

453
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:15,164
How you feeling?

454
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:22,239
Word to the wise...

455
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,675
don't piss off
the nerd angels.

456
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:29,179
So, how's it going?

457
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,150
Adam's gone.

458
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:34,551
The angels have him.

459
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:35,952
Where?

460
00:29:35,953 --> 00:29:37,287
The room where they took you.

461
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:38,822
You sure?

462
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:41,124
Cass did a recon.

463
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,426
And?

464
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,427
And the place is
crawling with mooks...

465
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:47,130
pretty much a no-shot-in-hell,
hail-Mary kind of thing.

466
00:29:47,131 --> 00:29:49,966
Ah, so the usual.

467
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:52,134
What are you gonna do?

468
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:53,769
For starters...

469
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,938
I'm bringing you with.

470
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:57,239
Excuse me?

471
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,208
There are too many of them.

472
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:00,609
We can't do it alone,

473
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,713
and, uh, you're pretty much
the only game in town.

474
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:12,822
Isn't that a bad idea?

475
00:30:12,823 --> 00:30:14,323
Cass and Bobby think so.

476
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:15,959
I'm not so sure.

477
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,630
Well, they're right.

478
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,998
Because either it's a trap

479
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,767
to get me there,
to make me say yes...

480
00:30:22,768 --> 00:30:25,603
or it's not a trap
and I'm gonna say yes anyway.

481
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:28,807
And I will.
I'll do it... fair warning.

482
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:31,143
No, you won't.

483
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:36,585
When push shoves,
you'll make the right call.

484
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:42,954
You know, if
tables were turned...

485
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,656
I'd let you rot in here.

486
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:46,825
Hell, I have
let you rot in here.

487
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:51,329
Yeah, well...

488
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,863
I guess I'm not that smart.

489
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,799
I-I don't get it... Sam,
why are you doing this?

490
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,670
Because...

491
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,440
you're still
my big brother.

492
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:21,524
Where the hell are we?

493
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:22,992
Van Nuys, California.

494
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:24,994
Where's the beautiful room?

495
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:26,228
In there.

496
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:28,663
The beautiful room is in
an abandoned muffler factory

497
00:31:28,664 --> 00:31:29,864
in van Nuys, California?

498
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:31,332
Where'd you think it was?

499
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,000
I-I don't know... Jupiter?

500
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:35,869
A blade of grass...
not van Nuys.

501
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,570
Tell me again why
you don't just grab Adam

502
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:38,972
and shazam the hell
out of there?

503
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:41,507
Because there are at least
five angels in there.

504
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,176
- So? You're fast.
- They're faster.

505
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,647
I'll clear them out.

506
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:49,482
You two grab the boy.

507
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:51,150
This is our only chance.

508
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:52,686
Whoa, whoa, wait. You're gonna
take on five angels?

509
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:55,221
Yes.

510
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:57,357
Isn't that suicide?

511
00:31:57,358 --> 00:31:58,458
Maybe it is.

512
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,728
But then I won't
have to watch you fail.

513
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:03,430
I'm sorry, Dean.

514
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:07,101
I don't have the same faith
in you that Sam does.

515
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:14,910
What the hell are
you gonna do with that?

516
00:33:38,124 --> 00:33:40,024
What are you waiting for?

517
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:41,893
Come on.

518
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,394
Adam, hey. Hey.

519
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:50,763
You came for me.

520
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:51,864
You're family.

521
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:53,366
Dean, it's a trap.

522
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,035
I figured.

523
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:57,504
Dean, please. Did you really
think it would be that easy?

524
00:34:57,505 --> 00:34:59,072
Did you?

525
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:05,743
Sam!

526
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:08,512
You know what I've learned
from this experience, Dean?

527
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:12,015
Patience.

528
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:15,051
Adam?

529
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:16,853
Let him go,
you son of a bitch.

530
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:19,021
I mean, I thought
I was downsized for sure,

531
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:21,424
and for us, a firing...
pretty damn literal.

532
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:25,295
But I should have
trusted the boss man.

533
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:28,098
It's all playing out
like he said...

534
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:30,734
You, me... your
hemorrhaging brothers.

535
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,344
You're finally ready, right?

536
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,747
You see things our way.

537
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:45,582
You know there's
no other choice.

538
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,217
There's never
been a choice.

539
00:35:47,218 --> 00:35:48,618
Stop it.
Stop it right now!

540
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:51,020
In exchange for what?

541
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:54,990
Damn it, Zachariah.

542
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:58,627
Stop it, please.

543
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:02,865
I'll do it.

544
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:06,034
I'm sorry, what was that?

545
00:36:09,706 --> 00:36:12,441
Okay, yes.

546
00:36:12,442 --> 00:36:14,010
The answer is yes.

547
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:15,244
Dean!

548
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,147
Do you hear me?

549
00:36:18,148 --> 00:36:21,284
Call Michael down, you bastard!

550
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:29,493
How do I know
you're not lying?

551
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:31,695
Do I look like I'm lying?

552
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,892
He's coming.

553
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:09,599
Of course, I have a few conditions.

554
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:13,802
What?

555
00:37:13,803 --> 00:37:16,371
A few people whose safety
you have to guarantee

556
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:17,439
before I say yes.

557
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,475
Sure, fine.
Make a list.

558
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:20,810
But most of all...

559
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,915
Michael can't have me
until he disintegrates you.

560
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,850
What did you say?

561
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:30,386
I said...

562
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:33,924
before Michael gets one piece
of this sweet ass...

563
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:36,927
he has to turn you
into a piece of charcoal.

564
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:40,831
You really think Michael's
gonna go for that?

565
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:43,467
Who's more important
to him now?

566
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:44,834
You...

567
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:46,069
or me?

568
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:48,937
You listen to me.

569
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:52,875
You are nothing but a maggot
inside a worm's ass.

570
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:54,476
Do you know who I am...

571
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:55,944
after I deliver you to Michael?

572
00:37:55,945 --> 00:37:57,412
Expendable.

573
00:37:57,413 --> 00:38:00,381
Michael's not gonna kill me.

574
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:02,617
Maybe not.

575
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:03,985
But I am.

576
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:27,974
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

577
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:29,408
Okay, come on.

578
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:37,518
Come on, move it!

579
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:40,654
No!

580
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:42,022
Dean, help!

581
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,022
Come on, help me.

582
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:47,495
Ah.

583
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:48,729
Dean, help!

584
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:50,729
Dean!

585
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,729
Hold on. We'll get you out.

586
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:56,729
Just hold on.

587
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:59,729
Adam, can you hear me?

588
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:07,214
Adam?

589
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:33,579
You think Adam's okay?

590
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,147
Doubt it.

591
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:37,482
Cass either.

592
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:38,950
But we'll get 'em.

593
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:44,588
So?

594
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,825
"So"... what?

595
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:49,993
I saw your eyes.

596
00:39:49,994 --> 00:39:52,762
You were totally
rockin' the "yes" back there.

597
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,167
So... what changed your mind?

598
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:02,339
Honestly?

599
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,808
The damnedest thing.

600
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:08,612
I mean, the world's ending...

601
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:11,282
the walls are
coming down on us...

602
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:15,286
and I look over to you
and all I can think about is,

603
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:18,190
"this stupid son of a bitch
brought me here."

604
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:22,794
I just didn't want
to let you down.

605
00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:27,633
You didn't.

606
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,735
You almost did...

607
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:31,970
but you didn't.

608
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:34,907
I owe you an apology.

609
00:40:34,908 --> 00:40:36,542
No, man.
No, you don't.

610
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:38,911
Just... let me say this.

611
00:40:40,713 --> 00:40:44,115
I don't know if it's being
a big brother or what. But...

612
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:45,650
you know, to me,

613
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,419
you've always been
this snot-nosed kid

614
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,255
that I've had to keep
on the straight and narrow.

615
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:55,025
I think we both know that
that's not you anymore.

616
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:04,167
I mean, hell... if you're grown-up
enough to find faith in me...

617
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:06,769
the least I can do
is return the favor.

618
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:16,181
So, screw destiny
right in the face.

619
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,751
I say we take the fight
to them. Do it our way.

620
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:26,057
Sounds good.
