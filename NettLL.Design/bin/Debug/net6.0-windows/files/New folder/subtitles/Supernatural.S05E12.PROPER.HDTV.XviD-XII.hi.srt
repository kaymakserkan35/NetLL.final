00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:18,019
Evening barkeep. I would like 
to purchase some alcohol, please.

00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:20,854
Uh-huh. What can I get you?

3
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:23,457
Well, I'm 26, as you can see

4
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,459
from my license.

5
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:28,128
Congratulations. 
What can I get you?

00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:30,731
A banana daiquiri, my good man.

7
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:34,868
I'm Crystal.

8
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:36,537
What's your name?

9
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,272
- Hi, Crystal. 
- I'm Gary.

10
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:40,541
Gary, I don't want 
to embarrass you,

11
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,975
but you are just...

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,378
you are just a 
stunning-looking man.

13
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,246
[ exhales sharply ] I know, right?

14
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:52,086
Ooh! Thanks!

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,621
So, Gary, you having 
a good time tonight?

16
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,124
Mm! Thank you 
for asking, Crystal.

17
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,660
This is, like, the best night ever.

18
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,997
Do you think we could 
make it any better?

[ slurps ]

20
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,435
Probably. I don't know.

21
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,173
I mean, do you want 
to get out of here?

22
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:18,112
Well, I-I kind of like this bar,

23
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,914
and I just ordered this daiquiri.

24
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,583
[ slurps ]

25
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:23,784
I mean...

26
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,752
Do you want to get out
of here with me?

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,128
Are we talking about sex?

28
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,330
Well, I, uh...

29
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,098
[ laughs ]

30
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:41,201
Yeah. I suppose we are.

[ inhales sharply ]

32
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:47,674
Crystal, I would love to 
have the sex with you.

[ chuckles ]

34
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,177
Great.

35
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,012
Then let's go.

36
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,987
Love that jacket on you, by the way.

37
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,988
Thanks.

38
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:03,824
Actually...

39
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:07,528
the whole outfit is new.

42
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,781
So, how long has it been?

43
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:28,115
The summer before 6th grade.

44
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,617
Mm-hmm. I remember.

45
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,786
You assigned yourself 
your own reading list.

46
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,755
[ chuckling ] That's right.
I forgot about that.

47
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,626
Your mom happens to be the
best babysitter we ever had.

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,229
Well, when I was a 
maid at the Mayflower,

49
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,331
out on the interstate,

50
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:45,600
long before you were even an idea...

51
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:47,301
their daddy used to 
pass through town

52
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:48,669
and leave the boys with me

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,173
While... he went off to...work.

54
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:54,908
One time, he was 
gone for two weeks.

55
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:56,610
- Two weeks? 
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,113
Oh, he'd always come limping back.

57
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,048
He loved you boys.

58
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,918
Do you know what 
he did all that time?

59
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:07,354
Little Sammy kept trying to tell me.

60
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,423
of course, I didn't believe him.

61
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:10,757
Not at first, anyway.

62
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:13,427
[ inhales sharply ]

63
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,863
Katie, our dad, um...

64
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:17,598
happened to be an expert
at getting rid of ghosts,

65
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,000
and now, so are we.

66
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,802
That's why I called them, sweetie,
they can help us.

67
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,806
Sounds like you guys got
yourself a poltergeist.

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,175
Started a month or 
two after we moved in.

69
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,178
Yeah, first I-it was, uh,
just bumps and knocks

70
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,313
and, uh, scratches on the walls

71
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,282
and then it started breaking things

72
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,717
and then it attacked Katie?

73
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:39,019
That was two nights ago.

74
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,488
Can you show them, honey?

75
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,495
"murdered Chylde."

Dean: Katie...

77
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,237
Everything's gonna be fine.

78
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,772
I promise.

79
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,742
Why don't you guys take
yourselves a little vacation,

80
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,077
and, uh, we'll take care of it.

81
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:06,213
[ sighs ] Thank you.

00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,355
Uh, bacon burger turbo,
large chilli-cheese fry,

83
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,959
uh, and a health-quake salad shake?

I know. I know.

00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:24,498

You know, poltergeist aside,

Donna looked pretty 
good, don't you think?

Dude, don't tell me

you've still got the
hots for our babysitter.

That's weird. [ chuckles ]

She's... she's doing good.

You know, with her husband, her kid.

This whole amityville thing being thrown
at them, and they're hanging tough.

Yeah.

You ever think that you'd
want something like that?

What do you got?

108
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:27,995
Uh, well, that house of theirs,

109
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,663
It's old... really old.

110
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,431
Um, hundreds of years

111
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,634
and I found a legend.
It's unconfirmed, but still...

112
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:34,635
Saying?

113
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,136
Supposedly, in the 1720s,

114
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,971
house was owned by a guy
named Isaiah Pickett.

115
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,773
Legend has it

116
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:43,377
he hung a woman in his
backyard for witchcraft...

117
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,978
a woman named Maggie Briggs.

118
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,980
Okay, so an angry ghost witch?

119
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,415
If it's true.

120
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,251
That still doesn't explain
what "murdered Chylde" means.

121
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,453
No. Or where the bitch is buried.

122

You know, I mean, 
it's a long way back,

123
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,226
but I can see if I can find
something in the town records.

Can't even find proof a woman 
named Maggie Briggs existed,

minute to breathe here
