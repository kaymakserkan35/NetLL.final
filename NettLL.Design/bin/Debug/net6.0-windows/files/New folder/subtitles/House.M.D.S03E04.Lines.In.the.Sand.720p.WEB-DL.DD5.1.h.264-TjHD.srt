1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,060
Adam, eyes here.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,670
(SHOUTS)

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,860
Follow my finger.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,170
Adam, show me a bicycle.

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,580
Eyes here.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,290
Adam, show me a bicycle.

7
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,500
No, buddy, that's a ball.

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,280
Adam, look at me.
Are you hungry?

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,080
Show me what you
want for lunch.

10
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,170
He's still drawing those lines
instead of
looking at the cards.

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,710
More juice?

12
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,370
If he wants more juice,
he has to ask for it.

13
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,080
Adam, buddy, eyes here.

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,310
He's tired, Dom.

15
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,980
He wouldn't be
if we stuck to the schedule.

16
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,760
Show me the juice, buddy.

17
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,420
I think we've reached
the point of
diminishing returns.

18
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,760
He has to ask for it. Adam.

19
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,220
He's choking.

20
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,760
That's impossible.
It's mac and cheese.

21
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,840
Ten-year-old boy who screams
for his life for no reason.

22
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,510
He's autistic.
Severely autistic.

23
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,610
Can't talk,
can't make eye contact.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,950
Screaming is probably his way
of communicating.

25
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,960
And he went to
three different doctors
who all said just that.

26
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,320
So, clearly that can't be
the answer.

27
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,950
His brain can't
filter information.

28
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,490
It's a constant assault
on his senses.
I'd scream, too.

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,060
Or it's something
medical-sounding,
like dysesthesia.

30
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,400
Parents are convinced
that there's something wrong
with their son.

31
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,370
Since when did we start
believing parents? Or anyone?
Where are we going?

32
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,840
Elevator.

33
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,580
Dad was on Wall Street,
Mom was a partner
in an accounting firm.

34
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,780
When their son was diagnosed
with autism, they both quit.

35
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,790
So they're over-protective
and scared. That's all
the more reason to discount...

36
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,080
They study this kid.

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,420
Heard him scream a million
times, but in ten years
of caring for him,

38
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,120
this is the first time
they've brought him
to a hospital.

39
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,630
ER checked his throat.
No obstructions, nothing.

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,160
Which means the only symptom
was a scream,

41
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,720
which is diagnostic
of nothing.

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,930
Kid clutched his chest,
BP was elevated,
maybe there was chest pain.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,970
ER said the heart was fine.

44
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,600
Don't be so quick
to dismiss pain.

45
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,830
Where are we going?
Down.

46
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,880
Stool sample
to check for parasites,

47
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,880
blood culture to
rule out infection,
and ANA for lupus.

48
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,350
Because he screamed?

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,380
Could also be
an environmental reaction.

50
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,980
An allergy.
Dust, wheat, pollen,

51
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,210
a toxin or something he ate.
Check the house.

52
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,120
And run a lung
ventilation scan.

53
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,590
Lungs are in the chest,
too, right?

54
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,090
I had a date last night,
she screamed.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,920
Should we spend
a hundred thousand dollars
testing her?

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,760
Of course not.
This isn't a
veterinary hospital.

57
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,700
Look, if you don't think
this kid is worth saving...

58
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,060
That's not what I'm saying.

59
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,630
That's too bad.
It was a good point.

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,600
Kid's just a lump
with tonsils.

61
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,760
You know what it's
going to be like

62
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,330
trying to put an autistic kid
into a nuclear scanner?

63
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,270
I don't envy you guys.

64
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,350
I want my old carpet back.

65
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,280
We're going to have to
do this later. A kid
in the clinic had an accident.

66
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,920
Generally, when people
are on the phone...

67
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,690
I want my old carpet back.

68
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,090
It was stained with blood.

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,720
Yeah, my blood,
which makes the carpet
part of me.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,960
I want it back.
I want to be buried with it.

71
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,160
You think you can get me to do
anything you want,

72
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,170
regardless of
how stupid it is?

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,300
It's my office.
It's where I work,

74
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,540
where I think, where
I save lives, allowing you
to brag to rich people,

75
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,070
so they'll give you more money
to spend on MRls
and low-cut tops.

76
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,910
I want it back the way it was.

77
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,510
It's identical
to the old carpet.

78
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,020
Except without
the hazardous
biological waste.

79
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,490
I shall not return to my
office until every patented,
durable micro-fiber

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,250
has been restored
to its rightful place.

81
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,660
Inspiring.

82
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,690
If you don't want to
work in your office,
work in the clinic.

83
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,220
If you don't want to work
in the clinic, go home.
And don't get paid.

84
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,940
Attica! Attica!
Attica! Attica! Attica!

85
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,140
Attica?

86
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,640
He just needs to
finish this level.

87
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,780
We only have the scanner
for the next half hour.

88
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,410
After that...
Trust me,

89
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,050
you don't want to move him
until he's finished.

90
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,080
The sooner we do this test,
the sooner we can
get you guys home.

91
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,290
Adam, do you think that...

92
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,930
No.

93
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,810
Ten minutes. Tops.

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,570
If he has a vascular disorder,
he might not have...

95
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,910
He might not have ten minutes?

96
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,540
I don't have ten minutes.

97
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,990
No! No! You don't want to
do that. Adam? Adam?

98
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
(SCREAMING)

99
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,390
I used Metamucil
like the doctor told me

100
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,160
and finally I was able to
use the bathroom.

101
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,660
But I saw something
in the toilet
I couldn't identify.

102
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,200
I wrapped it in tissue paper,
so you could take a look.

103
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,810
Can't you sedate him
or something?

104
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,580
I could if I didn't want
the test results
to mean anything.

105
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,400
Painkillers, exercising,

106
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,000
we even did that
puncture thing, nothing works.

107
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,940
Then this morning, I get up,
my back feels great.

108
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,770
I figured I'd better
get down here, right away.

109
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,120
Big shocker, Dad's depressed.

110
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,250
Save your time.

111
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,590
SSRls don't cause chest pain.

112
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,460
Wow.

113
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,600
Every minute of every day
is booked.

114
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,200
When he eats, sleeps,
plays his handheld.

115
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,370
Not much of a life for them.

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,530
They chose to have a family.

117
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,140
You don't get to decide
what your kid's
going to be like.

118
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,010
Nobody chooses this.

119
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,110
It's funny,
you get a normal kid,
the parent works.

120
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,060
You get a special kid
that costs more,

121
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,030
you quit and turn the backyard
into a therapy circuit.

122
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,560
Yes, if only you
were handicapped.

123
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,790
All the good times
you could have had with Dad.

124
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,280
Hi, Doctor House.

125
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,710
Hello, girl whose name
I don't remember,

126
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,650
but whose dad I treated,
so I don't really know
why she's here.

127
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,060
Ali. I think I caught
what my dad has.
The rhino thing.

128
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,790
Right.

129
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,500
Does that hurt?

130
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,690
Little.

131
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,660
It's in my chest, too.

132
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,070
Of course it is.

133
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,450
Kind of had access
through the shirt,
but this'll work.

134
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,420
That feels good.

135
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,520
Exactly when did New Jersey
run out of horny
17-year-old boys?

136
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,600
About five weeks ago.
It's been very lonely.

137
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,970
The...

138
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,710
The ventilation scan
was normal.
Time to send him home.

139
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,380
Can't leave right now.
Well, congratulations.

140
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,010
You are the proud owner
of your very own
"rhino thing."

141
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,780
A rhinovirus?
You can't leave because
she has a cold?

142
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,790
I can't leave because
Cuddy says I can't leave.

143
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,720
All the tests are normal.

144
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,530
Okay, don't start with me.
We're backed up.

145
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,530
I know this is hard
for all of us,
but thanks to Doctor Cuddy,

146
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,540
I don't have an office,
so I have to work here.

147
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,170
What did she do
to your office?

148
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,710
It's unusable.

149
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,340
So whatever's bothering him,
it wasn't his lungs.

150
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,510
What about the kid's house?

151
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,450
There were some pesticides
and some alcohol, but
the tox screen was negative.

152
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,750
Which means there's nothing
physically wrong
with this kid.

153
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,620
We already had
that discussion.
We get a fecal smear?

154
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,420
Should we do this
someplace else?

155
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,520
No, Cuddy says
I have to work here.

156
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,550
No, I said you can work
in your office,
or you had to work here.

157
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,250
And since I can't work
in my office...

158
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,270
Is this your master plan?

159
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,200
Disrupt hospital business
until I replace your carpet?

160
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,240
Devious. Saw it
in a James Bond movie.

161
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,940
Fecal smear! Talk to me.

162
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,530
Get out of here.

163
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,640
Put back my carpet?

164
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,200
No. Get out of here.

165
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,650
Fecal matter.
Is there a sample
we can look at?

166
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,410
The parents have a smear kit.
The kid is constipated.

167
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,390
Do what you want.
Not replacing your carpet.

168
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,160
Go up his rear
and get a smear.

169
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,850
Which reminds me,
I kind of feel like a bagel.

170
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
Carpets.

171
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,000
Need a stool sample.

172
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,600
We should probably wait
until he's finished
playing that level, huh?

173
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,900
I actually think
he's a bit better today.

174
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,680
He seems more like
his old self.

175
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,650
It's possible that
he was never sick.

176
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,150
I guess,
we could've overreacted.

177
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,790
Adam? Adam?
Adam? Adam?

178
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,860
So what makes fluid
fill the lining
of a kid's lungs?

179
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,840
Why are we in here?
Is this some sort of
power play?

180
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,930
Yeah.

181
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,880
So, you stuck your finger
in the kid and gave him
a pleural effusion?

182
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,010
Have you ever considered
getting a manicure?

183
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,280
I took the stool sample
after his lungs failed.

184
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,080
Or do you really
have a problem
with the carpeting?

185
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,490
Change sets you off...

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,180
I said it was a power play.

187
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,090
If someone answers yes
to option A, you don't
move on to option B.

188
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,650
If there's a pleural effusion,
we have to rule out
heart failure.

189
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,030
Why now? Why a power play now?

190
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,570
I smelled weakness.

191
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,200
Get the kid an echocardiogram.

192
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,780
That's funny.
It says, "James Wilson."

193
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,310
That's a strange typo.

194
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,850
The fluid comes back
and exudates, get him on
broad spectrum antibiotics.

195
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,190
Thank you for coming.
No problem.

196
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,980
Thought you wouldn't mind
sharing offices for a while.

197
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,430
You share stories, feelings,
toys, you don't share offices.

198
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,860
That is so not Zen.

199
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,490
It was a gift.

200
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,370
Some doctors get those.

201
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,870
So, you want mornings
or afternoons?

202
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,640
You couldn't make
Cuddy miserable, so you're
going to make me miserable,

203
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,680
so I can make Cuddy miserable
on your behalf?

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,770
Yeah.

205
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,910
What makes you think
I can make her miserable?

206
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,470
'Cause you're
good at that stuff.

207
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,110
I'm nothing compared to you.

208
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,350
Is there anything
you'll throw out?

209
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,620
That's a gift from
an eleven-year-old
patient of mine.

210
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,890
She and I both knew it was
a piece of junk, and
that's what made her laugh.

211
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,550
So you gotta keep it
until she...

212
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,220
She already did.

213
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,400
(ADAM SCREAMING)

214
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,170
Adam, I need you to
stay still, buddy.

215
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,610
It's okay. It's okay.
I got him.

216
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,350
There we go.

217
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,760
What? What is it?
Is his heart okay?

218
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,220
No.

219
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,000
Echo suggested
a conduction abnormality,
EKG confirmed it.

220
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,300
Still doesn't explain the
effusion. The pleural fluid
was an exudate.

221
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,310
We should be looking for
something that explains both
the heart and lung problems.

222
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,750
An infection, parasite,
cancer.

223
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,980
Microbiology showed
no organisms in the fluids,
so forget infection.

224
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,390
It's not a power play.

225
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,320
Doing a differential
in the clinic makes sense,
piss Cuddy off.

226
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,620
Same thing with
Wilson's office,
works indirectly.

227
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,390
But now we're in office space

228
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,160
because you don't want to be
in your own office.

229
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,570
Which means this has nothing
to do with Cuddy.

230
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,040
You really are obsessed
with your carpets.

231
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,700
Which means...
What are you doing here?

232
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,140
I have this room
booked from two to three.

233
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,480
Two, East Coast Time?

234
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,720
I thought you meant Pacific.
Which is stupid of me,
I guess.

235
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,020
What about parasites?

236
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,690
Stool sample's negative.

237
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,880
It's two o'clock.

238
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,090
Oh, well. We should go then.
That just leaves cancer.

239
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,790
Get a lung biopsy.

240
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,700
It took a half an hour
to get the mask
on the kid for the lung scan.

241
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,900
I'm sorry.
Was there somewhere
you needed to be?

242
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,400
House, can we talk?

243
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,320
Carpet?
Never.

244
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,510
Nothing to talk about.

245
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,680
Your girlfriend called
the clinic 15 times,
looking for you today.

246
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,520
Lot to discuss,
china patterns...

247
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,080
House. She's a stalker.

248
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,180
Right.

249
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,820
Couldn't be that she finds me
interesting, attractive,
has to be that she's insane.

250
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,870
She's called you 15 times.
Your mother's not
that interested in you.

251
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,060
Well maybe I'd be
better adjusted if she was.

252
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,300
I'm notifying security.
Is this about the carpet?

253
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,070
Do you think I'll back off
if you block all my fun?

254
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,630
You better not be having fun.

255
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,370
I'm having fun.
I'm not having sex.

256
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,140
She's dangerous.
She's not dangerous.

257
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,740
She's pretty.
She's pretty.

258
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,940
Men are stupid.
I'm with you so far.

259
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,920
I'm notifying security.

260
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,950
Give her a break.
She's not dangerous,
she's insightful.

261
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,360
You can't stop our love!

262
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,470
Hey, you got a minute?
Yeah.

263
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,330
We have a ten-year-old
with pleural effusion

264
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,630
and conduction abnormality,
but no heart failure.

265
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,230
Was there protein
in the pleural fluid?

266
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,300
Yeah. That's why
we're thinking cancer.

267
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,640
Non-Hodgkin's probably.
So we want to do
a lung biopsy.

268
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,410
Lung biopsies usually
come back negative, so biopsy
a lymph node under the arm.

269
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,880
That's probably something
an oncologist should do,
right?

270
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,920
There's nothing real tricky
to it. It's a biopsy.

271
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,920
Still, just to be safe.
You mind?

272
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,850
(SCREAMING)

273
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,560
For the love of God,
can't somebody
shut that kid up?

274
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,200
People are trying to
work around here.

275
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,040
Why don't you show him
a teddy bear or something?

276
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,340
Who are you?

277
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,100
Somebody you'll
never send a gift to.

278
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,740
This is Doctor House,
your son's doctor.

279
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,510
High test, please.

280
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,450
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

281
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,580
Out of Vicodin?

282
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,190
What are you doing?

283
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,030
Eating the red berries.

284
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,310
He trusted you.

285
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,790
No, that wasn't trust.
That was self-preservation.

286
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,850
No. That was huge.

287
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,390
It was like a conversation.

288
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,170
A monkey's afraid to eat
the red berries until he sees
another monkey eat 'em.

289
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,240
Monkey see, monkey do.
That's all it was.

290
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,110
Your kid's still just
as messed up
as when we admitted him.

291
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,210
(CRASHING)

292
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,860
That was sensitive.

293
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,520
You have pretty hair.

294
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,060
Hope is all those parents
have going for them.

295
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,930
No, hope is what's
making them miserable.

296
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,670
What they should do is
get a cocker spaniel.

297
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,200
A dog would look them
in the eye,

298
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,610
wag his tail when he's happy,
lick their face,
show them love.

299
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,980
Is it so wrong for them
to want to have
a normal child?

300
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,110
It's normal to
want to be normal.

301
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,520
Spoken like
a true Circle Queen.

302
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,520
See, skinny,
socially-privileged
white people

303
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,680
get to draw this
neat little circle.

304
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,520
Everyone inside
the circle is normal.

305
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,860
Everyone outside the circle
should be beaten,

306
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,730
broken and reset,
so they can be
brought into the circle.

307
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,930
Failing that, they should be
institutionalized,
or worse, pitied.

308
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,240
So, it's wrong to feel sorry
for this little boy?

309
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,500
Why would you feel sorry
for someone

310
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,310
who gets to opt out
of the inane courteous
formalities,

311
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,870
which are utterly meaningless,
insincere, and therefore,
degrading?

312
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,880
This kid doesn't have to
pretend to be interested
in your back pain,

313
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,320
or your excretions,
or your grandma's itchy place.

314
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,910
Can you imagine
how liberating it would be

315
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,050
to live a life free of
all the mind-numbing
social niceties?

316
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,430
I don't pity this kid.
I envy him.

317
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,970
No cancer because
these aren't lymph cells.

318
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,300
Then what are they?

319
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,610
Liver cells.

320
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,680
Wow, liver cells
under his arm.

321
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,590
Wonder what he's got
where his liver's
supposed to be?

322
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,170
Anyone got a clue how
liver cells got
into the kid's armpit?

323
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,420
Make yourself at home.

324
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,750
So, you think maybe
Gray's <i>Anatomy</i>
got it all wrong?

325
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,420
Lymph system circulates fluid,
not organ cells.

326
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,760
Cancer cells break into
the lymphatic system
all the time.

327
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,320
But we're not talking
about cancer cells.

328
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,960
So what's the difference
between cancer cells
and liver cells?

329
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,230
Why can one
pass through walls,
but the other can't?

330
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,270
Cancer cells are damaged,
it lets them grow
into blood vessels,

331
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,430
go wherever they want.

332
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,830
So if the liver cells
are damaged...

333
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,100
The liver isn't damaged.
The tests were normal.

334
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,570
So if the liver cells
are damaged,

335
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,340
it's theoretically possible
they passed into
the lymphatic system.

336
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,510
Liver failure could also
explain pleural effusion,
even the heart issues.

337
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,810
The liver cells are fine.

338
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,320
He was immunized for
Hep A and B, and do you
really think this kid

339
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,220
is having unprotected sex,
or sharing needles?

340
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,960
Daddy does seem
the type to use a rubber.

341
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,620
So it's not viral.
That just leaves
a lot of booze-irrhosis.

342
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,660
Our 10-year-old boy does not
have a drinking problem,
or cirrhosis.

343
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,960
House, when we
echoed his heart,

344
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,700
we got a piece of his liver.
There was no scarring.

345
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,470
Cirrhosis explains
the symptoms,
heart problems, lungs...

346
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,010
Look up cirrhosis
in the dictionary,
it means scarring.

347
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,410
Parents aren't doing
or dosing this kid.

348
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,710
How would you know that?

349
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,110
The kid can't talk.
Why do you think
I took this case?

350
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,620
He's not going to give away
the ending.

351
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,150
They quit their jobs for him.

352
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,680
Yes, they are everything
you'd want in a parent.

353
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,820
Unfortunately,
their kid is nothing
you'd want.

354
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,590
When a baby is born,
it's perfect.

355
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,890
Little fingers, little toes,
plump, perfect, pink,

356
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,630
and brimming
with unbridled potential.

357
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,800
Then it's downhill.
Some hills
steeper than others.

358
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,400
Parents get off
on their kids'
accomplishments.

359
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
<i>Bend over and relax.</i>

360
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,700
Cute.

361
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,650
They'll annoy you
with trophy rooms
and report cards.

362
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,680
Hell, they'll even show you
a purple cow

363
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,950
and tell what a keen eye
for color their kid has.

364
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,000
But this kid,
he doesn't smile,

365
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,900
he doesn't hug them,
he doesn't laugh.

366
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,190
His parents get nothing

367
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,170
but the right to brag that
their kid picked orange juice
out of a lineup.

368
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,870
So you figure they slip
the kid a mickey
so they don't have to deal.

369
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,140
Do a biopsy
to confirm cirrhosis.

370
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,440
Don't try to pawn it off
on Wilson, he's going to be
busy with Cuddy.

371
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,820
My parents love me
unconditionally.
Get out of here.

372
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,050
Don't you think
the restraining order's
a little much?

373
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,690
He's not actually going to
have sex with
a 17-year-old patient.

374
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,360
I didn't think he was
going to ask me

375
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,900
to dig a bloodstained carpet
out of a dumpster, either.

376
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,460
It might be easier
in the long run.

377
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,730
Are we stopping here,
so House doesn't find us?

378
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,970
Unless you want to make out.

379
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,480
You want me to surrender
to House's coup?

380
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:41,050
No, no. You pro-actively
give him what he wants.

381
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,390
I defeat him
by surrendering to him.

382
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,520
He'll never see it coming.
Look, I'll pay for it myself.

383
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,620
What is it, a thousand bucks
to carpet a room?

384
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,460
Actually, it's 400.

385
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,000
Not doing it.

386
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,100
Liver biopsy?

387
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,270
They're doing it now.

388
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,570
How's it going?

389
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
Like a biopsy.

390
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,380
Needles, cells, screaming.

391
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,340
What did you find
in the stool sample?

392
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,650
You were too busy
bothering Cuddy.

393
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,650
But as discussed,
it was negative for parasites.

394
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,090
Can we get out of here?

395
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,280
I didn't ask
what you didn't find,

396
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,450
I asked what you did find
in the stool sample.

397
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,460
Stool

398
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,120
and traces of iron, zinc,
calcium carbonate.
Can we leave?

399
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,030
What's the matter?
You afraid of the man?

400
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,390
Yeah.

401
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,470
Too late.

402
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,960
Leave my stuff alone.

403
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,570
You have a meeting with
a Guggenheim in 15 minutes.
You're wearing that?

404
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,080
I'm going to count to three
and then I'm going to
fire you. One.

405
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,950
Calcium carbonate?
That's an anti-diarrheal,
right?

406
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,650
Two.
Think that's significant?

407
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,050
Think hard poops
is significant?

408
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,880
Two and a half.

409
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,890
Never threaten
unless you're ready
to deliver.

410
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,390
Makes you look weak.

411
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,490
Thank God you don't
have children.

(PHONE RINGING)

413
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,170
Doctor Cuddy.

414
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,530
Take a message.

415
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,240
Your patient is being
rushed to cardiac ICU.

416
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,470
Wow. That's like the one thing
that would get me out of here.

417
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,020
I'm sorry,
you can't come in here.

418
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,610
What's going on?

419
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,290
One, two, three.

420
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,520
He's in V fib.

421
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,520
Charged.

422
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,930
CHASE: Clear.

423
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,660
Charging, clear.

424
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,330
Charging, clear.
Charging, clear.

425
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,190
He's stable for the moment.
First-degree
atrial ventricular block.

426
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,520
Okay, what else do we know?

427
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,530
His liver's damaged.
Pleural effusion compromised
his lung function.

428
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,030
Biopsy was negative
for cirrhosis.

429
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,220
Parents didn't
poison their son.

430
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,300
It's not his liver,
his heart, or his lungs.

431
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,130
It's the calcium carbonate
in his stool.

432
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,970
Kid was constipated.
Parents probably
just overdid it.

433
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,170
Or they didn't do it at all.

434
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,340
Calcium carbonate
is also what's in chalk.

435
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,670
FOREMAN: So he ate some chalk.

436
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,240
It isn't toxic,
it sure didn't cause
the pleural effusion.

437
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,410
Forget the chalk.

438
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,780
You just said
it was about the chalk.

439
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,650
Yes, and then I said,
"Forget the chalk."

440
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,750
You must be very confused.
The kid's got pica.

441
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,360
You take him to a buffet,
he's going to eat the table.

442
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,590
Or lead paint.

443
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,130
Level of lead in the blood
was normal.
His tox screen was clean.

444
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,630
We're not looking
for typical poisons.

445
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,630
We're looking for anything
that he could
put in his mouth.

446
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,730
Matches, spiders, bricks.

447
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,360
Pressure-treated wood
used to contain arsenic.

448
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,630
Even better.

449
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,540
Hansel, get samples
of the Gingerbread House.
Bag everything.

450
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,880
Hey.

451
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,150
You could get into
a lot of trouble being here.

452
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,720
I wanted to see you.

453
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,160
Yeah, I got that.

454
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,230
So did everyone else.
They think you're a stalker.

455
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,500
One could argue those people
might be jealous
of your attention.

456
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,060
Yes, I actually
made that argument.

457
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,000
You going home?
That's the plan.

458
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,380
In Iceland,
the age of consent is 14.

459
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,150
I'm surprised that tourism
isn't a bigger industry
up there.

460
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,490
Today I'm jailbait,
but in 22 weeks,

461
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,260
anybody can do anything to me.

462
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,350
Will I be so different
in 22 weeks?

463
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,700
Twenty-two weeks is enough
for an embryo to grow
arms and legs.

464
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,930
It's just a line.

465
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,570
An arbitrary line drawn
by a bunch of sad,
old men in robes.

466
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,110
Yeah, who cares
what judges think?

467
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,710
I didn't think of you as a guy
who followed rules
just because they were rules.

468
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,120
You are over ten years
younger than me.

469
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,760
I said, "Over."

473
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,500
Do you happen to know the way
to the Icelandic consulate?

474
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,440
This young woman,
a stranger to me,
was just asking directions.

475
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,710
Security was going to
call the police. I don't
want to do that to you.

476
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,680
Go home.
She needed a ride.

477
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,120
She got here on her own,
she can get home on her own.

478
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,880
Now.

479
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,350
If I see you on
hospital grounds again,
I will call the police.

480
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,370
After that look,
I'm feeling a little frisky.
Looks like you're up.

481
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,480
I'm ovulating. Let's go.

482
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,910
The frisky, it went away.

483
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,210
House, this isn't a game.

484
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,220
If I leave her alone,
can I have my carpet back?

485
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,450
No.

486
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,130
If I forget about
my carpet can I have her?

487
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,520
Jimsonweed.
I found a small patch of it
in his backyard.

488
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,350
Jimsonweed contains atropine,
poor man's acid.

Meeting here will do nothing
to upset Cuddy.

492
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,640
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy.

493
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,140
I'm trying to figure out
what's wrong with the patient.

I'm done.

495
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,470
Jimsonweed doesn't explain
the screaming.

never had a bad trip.

Kid's got heart issues.
The two don't mix.

503
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,460
We'd better make sure
that's what he's got.

504
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,590
Serum from the lab
in Patterson is
three days minimum.

505
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,860
He won't survive three days.

506
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,430
What time does he wake up?

507
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,870
7:35 a.m.

508
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,200
Then what? Walk me through it.

509
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,210
7:40 to 7:50 he goes
to the toilet,
washes his face.

510
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,270
What does this matter?

511
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,510
I'm trying to prove
he ate the plant.

512
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,520
His schedule has nothing to do
with jimsonweed.

513
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,740
There are two possibilities.

514
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,580
Either the parents saw him
eat the plant or the kid
has unsupervised time,

515
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,890
and eats plants instead of
playing with blocks.

516
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,390
Even if you find 15 minutes
of free time outside,

517
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,050
it doesn't mean he spent it
eating a bush.

518
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,000
So, what do we do? Nothing?
Wait for the kid to tell us?
What?

519
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,070
Where are you going?

520
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,300
To talk to him.

521
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,380
Ever see your son eat a bush?

522
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,710
I haven't.

523
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,250
I've only ever seen him eat...

524
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,420
Adam, you ate something
at your house.

525
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,480
Something that made you sick.
I need you to show me
what you ate.

526
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,230
He can't answer you.

527
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,890
Neither can you.

528
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,730
This is your backyard.

529
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,910
You may know it
as Mel's Diner.
This is your sandbox.

530
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,310
Your jungle gym.
And under it is this.

531
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,470
I need to know
if you ate this, Adam.

532
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,110
He doesn't know what you want.

533
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,280
Adam, you have to tell me
because if you don't,

534
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,920
game over. You'll be dead.

535
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,990
What the hell are you doing?

536
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,860
Show me what you ate.

537
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,500
Adam, show me what you ate.

538
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,360
Adam?
Honey?

539
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,780
Adam!

540
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,370
Come on in,
brothers and sister,

541
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,270
welcome to
the house of the Lord!

542
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,700
House, come on. The Chapel?

543
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,740
We have been blessed
with the miracle
of a new symptom.

544
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,610
Brother, can you testify

545
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,140
as to why this poor child's
eyeball rolled back
into his head?

546
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,450
It's consistent with
jimsonweed poisoning,
ocular paralysis. I'm sorry.

547
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,190
The wicked shall deceive ye

548
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,320
because they have turned
from the Lord and are idiots.

549
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,870
His ocular muscle
didn't paralyze,
it pirouetted.

550
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,600
MS?
It is easier for a wise man

551
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,930
to gain access to heaven...
Will you stop doing that?

552
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,370
Just say, "Not MS."

553
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,670
A stroke, bleed in the brain.

554
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,540
We'd be seeing other symptoms
besides a single eye
misalignment. Like a coma.

555
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,880
And you've already testified.

556
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,440
It's a tumor.

557
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,550
And all the imaging
just missed it?

558
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,180
It's a micro-tumor.

559
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,450
It started in his lung,
which caused
the pleural effusion.

560
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,490
Then it metastasized
to his liver, which made
it slough cells.

561
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,930
And then it went to his brain
behind the eye, which caused
it to roll back into his head.

562
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,230
So, he had three tumors
and we missed all of them?

563
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,800
What's the opposite
of a miracle?

564
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,700
I have a better chance
of finding it, now that I know
exactly where to look.

565
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,430
So, unless you have
a better idea,

566
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm going to go CT his head
and then, if I have to,
remove his eye.

567
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,220
You remove this kid's eye,

568
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,120
he's only going to be
half as good at
not making eye contact.

569
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,390
CUDDY: Hello?

570
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,300
Hello?

571
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,270
Hello?

572
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,500
I have sad news for you.
She doesn't love you.

573
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,580
You're ugly
when you're jealous.

574
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,980
She showed up at my house
last night. Came on to me.

575
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,320
She's even more perfect
than I thought.

576
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,320
House, she's sick.

577
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,860
You say, "Sick,"
I say, "Freestylin'."

578
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,190
The girl will have sex
with an invertebrate.

579
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,490
Come on, you're not that bad.

580
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,560
She has a problem.

581
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,430
You're not doing her
any favors by indulging her.

582
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,230
How could you lie like this?

583
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,270
Do you not have room
in your heart for love?

584
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,470
You don't believe me.

585
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,340
I didn't believe the kids
when they said that Susie
was sleeping with Johnny.

586
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,840
I didn't believe them then.
I don't believe them now.

587
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,180
I don't care that
Susie married Johnny.
She's mine.

588
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,310
She has a mole
on her right breast,
just below the nipple.

589
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,480
No, she doesn't.

590
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,750
You've seen her breasts?

591
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,260
It was a medical exam.
I was listening to her heart.

592
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,690
It went, "Greg-House.
Greg-House. Greg-House."

593
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,790
Fine. I'm lying.

594
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:34,060
But she did come back.
She's locked up in my office.

595
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,790
I was hoping
you could talk to her,
put an end to this.

596
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,950
Listen to me.

597
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,320
Do you have any idea
what you'd have

598
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,720
to look forward to
if you stayed with me?

599
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,160
Nine chances out of ten,
we'd both wind up in a jail.

600
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,030
You're only saying that
to make me go.

601
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,430
I'm saying it
'cause it's true.

602
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,530
Inside of us, we both know
that you belong with Victor.

603
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,610
Is there a Victor
in your class?

604
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,980
If you're not with someone
your age, you'll regret it.

605
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:33,290
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but soon,
and for the rest of your life.

606
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,690
What about us?

607
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,090
We'll always have Fresno.

608
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,870
I'm no good at being noble,
but it doesn't take much
to see

609
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,340
that the problems
of two little people

610
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,740
don't amount to
a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

611
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,510
Someday you'll
understand that.

612
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,550
Now, now,
here's looking at you.

613
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,190
Damn.

614
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,370
Was there an earthquake
when you were in Fresno?

615
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,520
What?

616
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,300
I ask all my girlfriends that.

617
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,570
Yeah, a little one.

618
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,830
Damn.

619
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,740
What? What?

620
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,900
What is it?
It's not love.

621
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,110
You have spore in your brain.

622
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,320
Coccidioides immitis.
California's full of them.

623
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,410
They get an earthquake,
they get released
into the air,

624
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,250
you breath it in,
you get a cold.

625
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,690
Turns into sinus congestion,
aches, weakness, milky tears,
and sometimes

626
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,420
loss of inhibition
and judgment.

627
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,030
Damn!

628
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,570
So, loving you,

629
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:58,300
wanting to have sex with you
was all just
the spores talking?

630
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,580
You'll probably live.

631
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,220
Damn!

632
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,410
Hey! Don't touch his eye!

633
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,210
This is an appendectomy.

634
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,290
Like I said,
don't touch his eye.

635
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,420
Why isn't he in surgery?

636
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,760
Some emergency bumped him.

637
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,160
We've got another room
in ten minutes.

638
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,760
You're not taking him in.

639
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,430
Kill the lights.

640
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,970
He was seeing them
all the time.

641
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,970
What are you looking for?

642
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,340
HOUSE: He was telling us
what he was seeing.

643
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:08,610
Telling us exactly what was
wrong with him. Drawing them
for us over and over again.

644
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,280
But nobody knew
how to speak autistic.

645
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,720
When I asked him what he ate,
he even told me that.

646
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,850
What are you talking about?
What was he seeing?

647
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,860
Hello, my pretties.
It's not a tumor, Foreman.

648
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,920
It's worms
swimming in his eye.

649
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,040
Animal makes potty
in the sandbox,
boy plays in the sandbox.

650
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,700
Boy eats the sand.

651
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,830
You can probably tell
where this is going by now.

652
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,500
Stool samples were
negative for parasites.

653
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,480
Raccoon roundworms are not
excreted by their human host.

654
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,740
Cameron tested the sand.

655
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,080
All of it?

656
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,410
Worms spread from his gut
to the rest of his body.

657
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,650
They attacked his lungs,
that's what made him scream
and caused the effusion.

658
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,390
They invade his liver,
sending dead liver cells
coursing through his system.

659
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,790
They attacked his eye
and the muscles
surrounding it,

660
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,330
making his eyeball
do a back flip.

661
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,360
Laser photocoagulation
to fix the eye,

662
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,100
and a high dose of
benzimidazole
to kill the worms.

663
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,040
Wait a minute, that's it?
He's going to be okay?

664
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,940
Good news.

665
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,340
He's going to be with you
for a long, long time.

666
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,350
I'm going to read you
something.

667
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,620
"Asperger Syndrome is a mild
and rare form of autism.

668
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:28,990
"It is typically characterized
by difficulty
establishing friendships,

669
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,190
"and playing with peers,
trouble accepting
conventional social rules,

670
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:37,290
"and they dislike any change
in setting or routine."

671
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,840
Or broadloom.

672
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,230
It doesn't say that last part,
but you get my point.

673
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:45,750
House doesn't have Asperger's.
The diagnosis is much simpler,
he's a jerk.

674
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,780
Why do you think
he took this case?

675
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,510
Because he
believes these parents?

676
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,810
Because he wants to
help a young boy?

677
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,410
He sees himself in this kid,
and he's trying to
help himself.

678
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,980
He doesn't want this,
he needs it.

679
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,940
You're not autistic.
You don't even have
Asperger's.

680
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,280
You wish you did.

681
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,320
That would exempt you
from the rules,
give you freedom,

682
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,620
absolve you of responsibility,
let you date 17-year-olds.

683
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,280
But most important,
it would mean that
you're not just a jerk.

684
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:38,820
At what point does a person
endlessly lecturing someone
make him a jerk?

685
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:51,370
First tongue kiss is an eight
on the happiness scale.

686
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,110
Child being snatched back
from the brink of death,
that's a ten.

687
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,420
They're clocking in
at a very tepid
six point five,

688
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,450
because they know what
they have to go back to.

689
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,530
Listen,

690
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,160
thanks.

691
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,040
You saved his life.

692
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,070
Yeah, I know. See ya.

693
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,730
That was so good.

694
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,660
<i>(WAITING ON AN ANGEL</i> PLAYING)

695
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,770
That was a ten.

696
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,030
All change is bad?

697
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,340
It's not true, you know.
