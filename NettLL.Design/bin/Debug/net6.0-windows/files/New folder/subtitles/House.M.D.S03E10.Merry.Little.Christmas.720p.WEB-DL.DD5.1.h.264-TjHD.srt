00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,840
<i>('ZAT YOU, SANTA CLAUS?</i>
PLAYING)

2
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,460
Merry Christmas.

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,100
And a happy go to hell.

4
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,300
What's he doing here?
Is he with you?

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,440
Detective Tritter and I...

6
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,080
We worked out a deal.

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,050
Already got a lawyer.
Get out of my office.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,910
I told him I didn't write
those prescriptions.

9
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,690
I spoke with the DA.

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,990
He agreed to two months
in a rehab facility
in exchange for a guilty plea.

11
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,030
Get out of my office.

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,290
No jail time.

13
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,730
Right. So I should get
locked up in some place
I don't belong

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,290
in order to avoid getting
locked up in some other place
I don't belong.

15
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,170
I got you on forgery, fraud,
enough drugs to...

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,730
No sanctions
to the medical board.

17
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,300
And you get your car back

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,900
and your bank accounts
and your precious
tumor-ridden patients.

19
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,850
I did this to help you.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,540
Next Christmas,
buy me a sweater.

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,240
You punched out an employee!

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
You nearly cut a little girl
in half because you were
too strung out...

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,310
I was in pain!

24
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,720
You need to believe
that I've got a problem

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,990
so that your betrayal
has the illusion of nobility.

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,360
But you just selfishly...
Knock it off.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,530
Look, I don't care why
Dr. Wilson is doing this.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,070
And right now,
it makes no difference
to you, either,

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,770
'cause you need to deal with
the reality of
your current situation.

30
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,940
You want to
stand on principle,
you end up in a cell.

31
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,080
And you end up
never practicing
medicine again.

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,220
So you got two choices,
your principles or your life.

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,730
Get out of my office.

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,740
The DA put a clock
on the deal.

35
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,200
You got three days to decide.

36
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,950
House! Just give me a minute.
You're afraid of the pain.

37
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,480
You're not?

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,430
You can still have
pain meds in rehab.

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,620
Tramadol, gabapentin.
Those don't work.

40
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,730
They will once you're
weaned off the Vicodin.

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,830
Look, there's Jesus.
Better go tell the Romans.

42
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,630
Fine, run to Cuddy.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,000
You don't think
she's going to support me
on this?

44
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,740
Well, the stitches
are healing nicely,
there's no sign of infection.

45
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,140
Whoa.

46
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,580
Sorry.

47
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,690
Just need her
for a tiny moment.

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,760
Small favor.

49
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,290
Pills.

50
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,560
Who's the wit?

51
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,000
Doctor. Don't worry,
I'll be firing him soon.

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,870
Wait in my office.

53
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,140
Incision looks just big enough
for a chest tube.

54
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,440
Collapsed lung?
Someone mistake you
for a pinata?

55
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,470
Delightful. Usually
we just get the elf jokes
this time of year.

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,750
No on trauma.

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,880
Negative PPD.

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,310
What flavor dwarfs
are you guys?

59
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,820
My daughter and I both have
cartilage-hair hypoplasia.

60
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,360
Think you can make
a pun out of that?

61
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,450
Yes. But I don't
want to be insensitive.

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,860
She's got a bit
of a short fuse,
doesn't she?

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,800
It's a bleb.
Wait in my office.
Bleb's not a diagnosis,
it's an evasion.

64
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,600
We'll schedule
an MRI to make sure,

65
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,800
but a certain number
of these cases
are idiopathic.

66
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,470
Let me translate that
into Tolkien for you guys.

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,010
It means Dr. Cuddy's
got no idea

68
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,710
why your daughter's lung
suddenly popped
like a balloon.

69
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,410
You think you do?

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,920
Gimme her chart. And my pills.

71
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,510
Santa needs us.

72
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,020
Did you get that looked at?

73
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,790
I'm fine.

74
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,890
Great. I just admitted
a cartilage-hair hypoplasia
dwarf.

75
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,560
Fifteen years old...
What are you going to do?

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,600
I thought I'd get your
theories, mock them, then
embrace my own. The usual.

77
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,670
Wilson told us he ratted.

78
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,770
Your choice of verb,
I take it?

79
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,310
It's appropriate.
He betrayed you.
And you should take the deal.

80
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,350
Unexplained lung collapse
and anemia. Cuddy thinks
it's idiopathic.

81
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,420
"Cuddy" and "idiop"
being the relevant parts
of that sentence.

82
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,790
Well, I'd say TB,
but Cuddy's
already ruled it out.

83
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,620
Then you'd be just as big
an idiop as her.

84
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,060
Don't you people know
your dwarfs?

85
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,430
There are over 200 varieties
of dwarfism,

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,060
each with different
medical complications.

87
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,900
You can't expect us
to be intimately familiar
with all of them?

88
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,800
The sick dwarfs
sure expect you to.

89
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,370
Cartilage-hair hypoplasia.
They have compromised
immune systems.

90
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,310
Gold star for Cameron.

91
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,570
For extra credit,

92
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,210
explain to the special needs
section of the class

93
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,550
why our patient's negative
TB test is irrelevant.

94
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,250
A PPD involves
planting a fragment of TB
under the skin

95
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,020
to see if the immune system
recognizes it.

96
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,990
Because of
a compromised immune system,

97
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,220
our patient could have TB
but not recognize it.

98
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,390
The little people love you.

99
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,390
Let's go see a dwarf
about a gallium scan.

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,290
Gallium
is a radioactive isotope.

101
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,630
It travels through your veins,

102
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,760
allowing us to see
any bright spots
that might indicate infection.

103
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,910
I'm 4'1".
That's 1.5 canes in metric.

104
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,840
You don't look
a day over four feet.

105
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,320
I saw in the file that her dad
was normal-sized.

106
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,010
It's average-sized.

107
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,490
Compared to you,
I'm sure it was huge.

108
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,050
So did he have a fetish,

109
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,860
or did he just fall in love
with your long-legged soul?

110
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,390
He grew up in the circus.
Said I reminded him of home.

111
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,690
Seems like you're the one
with the fetish.

112
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,530
I'm certainly curious
about the logistics.

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,940
Did you stand on a table?

114
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,170
House!

115
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,240
Pretty much,
he'd lay flat and spin me.

116
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,370
Mom.

117
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,850
So, Abigail, you want to
hop up on the table for me?

118
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,650
That's going to be tough.

119
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,750
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me give you a boost.

120
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,120
Stop treating her
like she's five.

121
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,220
Just bring over a stool
and let her climb up herself.

122
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,820
Mom, it's okay.

123
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,260
I was just trying
to be helpful.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,760
She also hates Jews.

125
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,860
I've dealt with worse.

126
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,560
Being different,
you get used to
people's idiocy.

127
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,970
Still beats the hell out of
actually being an idiot.

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,170
What?

129
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,380
Care to go for a spin?

130
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,080
What the hell
were you thinking?

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,650
You didn't think ratting out
this hospital's best doctor

132
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,780
merited checking
with your boss first?

133
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,830
I didn't rat him out.
I got him a deal.

134
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,120
Which he'll never take.

135
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,790
He will if we...
How long have you known House?

136
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,630
Did you think
he'd suddenly become
reasonable?

137
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,000
I made the deal. It's done.
You can either
keep yelling at me,

138
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,800
or you can help me avoid
a complete disaster.

139
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,430
It already is going to be
a complete disaster!

140
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,270
He's not going to take
the deal. He's going
to go to jail.

141
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,740
Because he's a child,
he's too stubborn.

142
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,040
When a child misbehaves,
what do you do?

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,980
You take away something
he loves.

144
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,420
We can't take away
his Vicodin.

145
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,320
Not only will he be in pain,
he'll start to detox.

146
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,260
And we tell him the only way
to get the pills back
is to take the deal.

147
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,520
He won't be able to function.

148
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,650
That's the point.

149
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,560
You going to explain that
to his patient?

150
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,530
What choice do we have?

151
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,700
Gallium scan shows
no bright spots
of any kind.

152
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,710
Means it's not TB
or any other infection.

153
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,800
There are no bright spots
'cause the whole thing's
too bright.

154
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,640
Except for the liver.

155
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,680
The tech over-exposed
the image a bit,
but it's nothing.

156
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,910
The liver looks fine.

157
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,780
Could be lung cancer.

158
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,720
Tumor causes
structural damage.
The lung caves in on itself.

159
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,160
Also explains the anemia.

160
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,950
Doesn't explain
the liver problem, though.

161
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,290
Her lung collapsed.
There is no liver problem.

162
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,920
Did you guys look at the liver
on this thing?

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,230
There's no liver problem.

164
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,730
Seriously, look at the liver.

165
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,730
There's nothing there.
HOUSE: Why not?

166
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,030
Because there's nothing wrong?

167
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,560
Every organ in this scan
is lit up like
a hundred-watt bulb.

168
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,080
Except for her liver,
which is hovering around
60 watts.

169
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,870
And not one of them
good 60-watters,
but an energy saving...

170
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,580
You're saying her liver's
shutting down
because the lighting is off?

171
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,380
You just don't want
a cancer diagnosis,

172
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,980
because then you'd have
to deal with Wilson.

173
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,180
Lung cancer
is a lame diagnosis.

174
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,620
Avoiding Wilson
is an added bonus.

175
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,620
House, we need to talk.

176
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,220
Not taking the deal.
Glad we talked.

177
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,490
Ultrasound her liver.

178
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,030
Sit down.

179
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,600
Stand up.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,130
Your turn.

181
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,930
House, you're off the case.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,670
Your treatment privileges
are suspended

183
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,370
until you accept
Tritter's deal.

184
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,840
Well, I'm obviously
not going to take the deal

185
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,240
just so I can have the fun
of treating a dwarf.

186
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,870
So, I assume
there's more to this threat.

187
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm also cutting off
your Vicodin.
That could work.

188
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm taking over as attending.
Get an MRI of her lungs.

189
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,780
This is not lung cancer.

190
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,910
We'll find out as soon as
we MRI her lungs.

191
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,730
You're going to come
begging me
to save this girl

192
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,930
long before I come
begging you for pills.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,370
I hope not.

194
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,000
For everyone's sake.

195
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,510
This is wrong.

196
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,040
Cutting House off?
It might not work,
but it's not wrong.

197
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,090
Bone windows look clean.

198
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,590
Abigail, we need you
to hold still, okay?

199
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,220
<i>Can I come out?</i>

200
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,230
Just hang in there
two more minutes,
and we'll be done.

201
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,360
Okay.

202
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,230
Because it's effective
doesn't make it right.

203
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,260
Cuddy's bending the rules
to get a patient
to do the right thing.

204
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,860
Who would work
for a doctor like that?
And the ends
justify the means?

205
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,930
If the ends involve
us keeping our jobs, sure.

206
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,750
Lung parenchyma's clean.
No masses,
it's not lung cancer.

207
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,340
<i>(ABIGAIL COUGHING)</i>

208
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,110
Abigail, you okay?

209
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,350
House was right.
Her liver's failing.

210
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,830
Endoscopy confirmed
the vomiting was caused
by variceal bleeding.

211
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,630
Blood work also confirms
House's hypothesis.

212
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,930
I get it. House was right,
it's the liver. Let's move on.

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,770
What causes liver disease
and a collapsed lung?

214
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,330
Schistosomiasis,
the parasite could have...
There's no eosinophilia.

215
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,570
Cirrhosis could explain...
Could be a hepatoma.

216
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,480
She's 15.
It's not liver cancer.

217
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,010
It's not unheard of.

218
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,310
Cirrhosis fits better.
The question is,
what caused it?

219
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,820
Could be hepatitis,
Budd-Chiari...
Or drugs and alcohol.

220
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,620
If anyone has reason
to dull the pain,
it's a teenage dwarf.

221
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,090
I'll do a liver biopsy
to confirm.

222
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,760
And I'll search
the patient's home
for drugs and alcohol.

223
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,500
Cameron, got a moment?

224
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,110
What exactly
is your problem with me?

225
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,910
Hepatoma is a weak diagnosis.

226
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,850
So this is all about the case?

227
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,050
What else would it be about?

228
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,910
I made this deal to help him.

229
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,250
And helped yourself
at the same time.

230
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,060
This is not about my practice.
This is not about my car.

231
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,260
I gave both of them up
to help House and I would
have gone on without them,

232
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,430
if he hadn't almost maimed
that little girl and if he
hadn't punched out Chase.

233
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,370
Was it an easy choice?

234
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,700
Of course not. But it's right.

235
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,740
Then why wasn't it easy?

236
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,570
Because he's my friend.

237
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,310
It's obviously complicated...
It's complicated?

238
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,980
When you decided to talk
to Tritter, your life got
a million times better.

239
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,210
How do you separate that out?

240
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,380
How do you pretend your
windfall isn't relevant
to this decision?

241
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,460
It was the right thing to do.

242
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,660
You pretending your motives
are pure is why
I have a problem.

243
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,510
Where's Cuddy?

244
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,450
In this drawer. It's a rescue
mission. I've got it under
control, you can leave.

245
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,350
You were right
about the liver failure,

246
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,950
the patient had variceal
bleeding, which suggested
cirrhosis, but...

247
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,620
Off the clock.

248
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,560
You predicted this.
You obviously saw something.

249
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,000
Obviously.

250
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,070
Liver biopsy was negative
for cirrhosis but it showed
sclerosing cholangitis.

251
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,260
Even weirder,
there's no increase
in alkaline phosphatase.

252
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,210
Medical mystery.
Sounds like the kind of thing
I'd be good at.

253
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,150
Breaking and entering
sounds like the kind of thing
you'd be good at.

254
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,710
I take it that's where
Cuddy's been keeping
your pills.

255
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,090
One theory, one drawer.

256
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,990
Really?

257
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,690
I thought you'd be all for
this "torture House" plan.

258
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,290
It works, therefore it's good.

259
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,200
On the other hand,
I don't want to talk you
out of this deal

260
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,460
by pointing out
your hypocrisy.

261
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,170
So, patient's life at stake,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

262
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,840
Forget about the specific
nature of the liver
dysfunction, it's irrelevant.

263
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,880
The dwarf's problem is global,
that's why the gallium scan
was bright.

264
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,610
And it's going to spread
throughout her entire body
unless you stop it.

265
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,050
If that were true, more than
her lungs and liver
would be affected.

266
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,250
It will be.

267
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,810
It'll spread through
the biliary tree
and hit her pancreas next.

268
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,830
Stop retracing your steps,
get ahead of it.

269
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,490
Forget the liver
and focus on the pancreas
because after that...

270
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,260
Actually, after that
it doesn't really matter
what it hits

271
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,700
because, pretty much,
all roads lead
to a dead dwarf.

272
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,700
I get why you
don't want to go to rehab.

273
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,740
But only an idiot
goes to prison
for being stubborn.

274
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,940
Only an idiot stands between
Ahab and his whale. Move.

275
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,850
Sorry.

276
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,090
Santa's got gifts.

277
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,770
Olive oil wasn't
in the kitchen, it was
in the medicine cabinet.

278
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,100
Home remedy
for ear infections.

279
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,540
Ear infections
are fairly typical
among CHH dwarfs.

280
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,340
Or, it's a symptom.

281
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,440
Certainly wouldn't indicate
a pancreatic problem.

282
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,140
Or House is wrong
and it's a symptom.

283
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,650
Laxatives. I don't think
they were used to maintain
her girlish figure.

284
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,740
Again, intestinal problems
are common.

285
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,980
Again, it might be a symptom.

286
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,650
Glucosamine
suggests chronic joint pain.

287
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,700
Who ordered
an alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency test?

288
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,030
I did.

289
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,820
You think the problem's
in her pancreas?

290
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,390
I think it will be.
I think we need
to forget about the liver.

291
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,490
We just forgot about
the lungs, now we need
to forget about the liver?

292
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,130
We need to stop retracing
our steps and get ahead
of this thing.

293
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,770
House, you've tanned.

294
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,310
You don't think
I could have come up
with this?

295
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,680
Did you?

296
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,310
You suspended House because
it'd be dangerous
having him in charge,

297
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,370
but getting his opinion?

298
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,950
I'm sure he gave you that
opinion simply because he was
worried about the patient?

299
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,890
Just because House wants
his pills, doesn't mean
his theory is wrong.

300
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,420
No, the test results
mean that.
Your test was negative.

301
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,730
And the biopsy indicated
severe duct inflammation.

302
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,700
Do an ERCP
to check the liver
for bile duct cancer.

303
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,830
Just because it wasn't alpha-1
doesn't mean the pancreas
isn't next.

304
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,570
You needed an organ,
he needed a fix.

305
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,340
He'd have made up any story
for a pill. You didn't give
him anything, did you?

306
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,440
No.

307
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,710
(EXCLAIMS)

308
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,590
There's no bruise or nothing,
but it really hurts.

309
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,750
Unfortunately, that pain
and lack of bruising is
typical of a zygomatic break.

310
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,300
Sounds bad.

311
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,460
Bones are aligned properly.

312
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,090
Which ER did you go to
after the car accident?

313
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,630
Princeton Plainsboro.
Here's my discharge slip.

314
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,630
Okay.

315
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,230
I'm going to get you some
acetaminophen with codeine.

316
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,800
I tried that,
it makes me nauseous.

317
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,310
There's a drug
called gabapentin

318
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,050
which is good
for certain kinds of pain.
Great!

319
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,640
'Cause I haven't slept
in days.

320
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,950
Gabapentin's not really
going to help with the sleep.

321
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,010
Oh.

322
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,420
Is there something else
you can give me?

323
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,760
Vicodin's your best bet
with sleep issues.
Well, thanks so much.

324
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:22,130
Unfortunately, our policy
forbids prescribing opiates
to new patients.

325
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,070
Well, how could a clinic
have a rule
against relieving pain?

326
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,040
Just with opiates.
We find that it helps
weed out drug-seekers.

327
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,580
You think I'm a drug-seeker?
I'm not saying that.

328
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,670
Well, then give me
the Vicodin.
I can't.

329
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,240
Because you think
I'm a drug-seeker.

330
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,410
I just said I didn't.

331
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,820
No, you said that the policy
was to stop drug-seeking.

332
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,690
Then you said
I'm not a drug-seeker.
Policy doesn't apply.

333
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,950
I'm sorry, that's the policy.

334
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,980
Gabapentin works on
nerve damage.

335
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,120
You're prescribing it
for a broken face.

336
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,420
Might as well hand out
Band-Aids
for a severed carotid.

337
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,620
You're a doctor.

338
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,190
Not by
this clinic's definition,
since I'm neither a moron,

339
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,700
nor a mindless drone!

340
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,030
Security.
Forget it.

341
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,970
I'll throw myself out.

342
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,070
That tube is going
all the way down to my liver?

343
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,450
Don't worry,
you'll be sedated.

344
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,380
Sometimes doctors
have to do things

345
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,850
that make
people uncomfortable
to help them.

346
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,360
But we always want to respect
the patient's wishes

347
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,160
and not shove things down
their throats.

348
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,620
Foreman.

349
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,160
You haven't given
her the sedative.

350
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,260
No.

351
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,960
Abigail.

352
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,760
Abigail.

353
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,070
She's unconscious.

354
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,370
Check her airway.

355
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,270
Airway's clear.

356
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,740
Her breath smells fruity.

357
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,910
Diabetic ketoacidosis.

358
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,710
Hang an insulin drip
at.1 mgs per kg per hour!

359
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,150
Her pancreas is failing.
You ready to call House yet?

360
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,080
(SIGHS)

361
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,330
You were right.
The patient's pancreas
is failing.

362
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,430
Told you you'd come
begging me for help.

363
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,770
Her insulin production
is almost non-existent.

364
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,000
Give me my pills
or lose an arm.

365
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,770
The girl is dying!
So give me my pills.

366
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,870
Take the deal and I will.

367
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,750
You'd rather kill this girl
than give me my pills?

368
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,920
I would rather lose
one patient now

369
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,290
than the dozens we will lose
while you're in prison.

370
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,090
Well, have fun explaining that
to her itsy-bitsy
grieving mother.

371
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,200
What if we sacrifice this girl
and House still goes to jail?

372
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,870
I'd feel bad.
Can we get on with this?

373
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,710
House correctly predicted
the spread,

374
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,340
means we've got a global
systemic illness affecting
lungs, liver and pancreas.

375
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,810
So far. Ideas?

376
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,110
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
attacks multiple organ
systems.

377
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,490
Histiocytosis usually starts
in the brain, then moves
to the internal organs.

378
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,220
Abigail's brain is fine.
Cystic fibrosis.

379
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,690
Exocrine function's normal.

380
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,390
Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's a
systemic cancer, which her
dwarfism predisposes her to.

381
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,660
You have any ideas
that aren't cancer?
Cancer fits.

382
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,760
Autoimmune fits better.

383
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,230
We should treat her
with prednisone for lupus.

384
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,430
That'll spike her blood sugar
and put her back in a coma.

385
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,470
It's much safer just to run
a double-stranded DNA test.

386
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,130
Not if she dies before
we get the results.

387
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,440
One of you is probably right.

388
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,070
Why don't we hold the sniping
until we find out which?

389
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,580
Wilson, do an LP for lymphoma,
you guys run an antibody test
for lupus.

390
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,820
Because of your daughter's
dwarfism, we've had to pick
a higher entry point

391
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,090
for the lumbar puncture,
which increases the risk.

392
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,220
So, why not do
the lupus test first?

393
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,230
In the interest of time,
we think it's best
to proceed on both fronts.

394
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,630
You have no idea
what's wrong with my daughter.

395
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,670
We have several theories.
What does Dr. House think?

396
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,210
He's... He had to
go home sick.

397
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,340
My daughter may be dying
and he's gone home
with the sniffles?

398
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,540
Well, he's not...

399
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,610
He was the only one who seemed
to have any idea
what was wrong with her.

400
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,050
He better be
really damn sick.

401
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,280
He is.

402
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,250
HOUSE: Unless you've got
Vicodin, go away.

403
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,130
House, it's me, I...

404
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,700
Oh, God.

405
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,800
I don't have...
No pills?

406
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,900
No eggnog.

407
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,300
What happened to your arm?

408
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,650
Cut myself.

409
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,850
Wilson was wrong
about lymphoma.

410
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,980
Kid's not losing any weight,
no night sweats.

411
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,960
Cuddy send you?
No.

412
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,100
She doesn't trust me
not to give you pills.

413
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,230
Is she right?

414
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,100
House, these cuts
are straight, in a row.

415
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,090
You did this on purpose.

416
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,200
Cutting releases endorphins,
endorphins relieve pain.

417
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,810
You going to get me
some pills?

418
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,410
No.

419
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,610
Well, then you can leave.

420
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,910
No constitutional
symptoms means...

421
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,750
As soon as the kid gets cured,
Cuddy's got
no pressure to fold.

422
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,850
You really think
she's going to fold?

423
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,730
Autoimmune fits better
than cancer.

424
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,270
But lupus loves kidneys.
Usually attacks them first.

425
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,070
Kidneys are fine, right?

426
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,270
Yeah.

427
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,700
House,

428
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,870
take the deal.

429
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,610
You can survive
without Vicodin.

430
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,650
After you were shot,
you stayed clean for months.

431
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,710
Yeah.

432
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,220
I wonder if it had something
to do with
the absence of pain.

433
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,620
Leave that. I want to be able
to pour alcohol on it
so I can distract myself.

434
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,130
Then you can rip off
the bandage.

435
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,200
Kid been sick lately?

436
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,790
There's a history
of ear infections.

437
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,700
See, Abigail's immune system

438
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,400
is like a shy guy in a bar.

439
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,040
The ear infections,
they come in
and they try to coax him to...

440
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,890
To hell with the metaphor.

441
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,350
You get the point, right?

442
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,980
Nerd gets drunk,
trashes the bar.

443
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,220
One of the autoimmunes
triggered by
a minor infection?

444
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,360
Factor in her age,
elevated sed rate, anemia...

445
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,330
It's Still's disease.

446
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,630
We start her on prednisone,
methotrexate, cyclosporin.

447
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,870
House.

448
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,370
Stop this.

449
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,610
Please.

450
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,560
What'd he say?
Still's disease.

451
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,900
It's chronic,
but manageable...

452
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,030
A diagnosis
that's virtually unconfirmable

453
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,640
and with a treatment that's
more dangerous than what we
were considering for lupus.

454
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,510
How bad is he?

455
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,880
Are you asking
because you care

456
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,920
or because you're wondering
whether to trust his opinion?

457
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,110
Both.

458
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,680
He's detoxing. In agony.

459
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,550
He's started cutting himself.

460
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,760
But he's still House.

461
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,490
I'll order the treatment.

Figured I'd show you
how much it isn't working.

Yeah. Clearly, the drugs
have no hold on you.

We both know that my pride

469

far surpasses my instinct

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,810
You want to redeem yourself?
Give up now.

And you'll go to jail.

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,180

Nausea's bad this time.

You can write me a scrip
for metoclopramide
so I can stop puking.

478
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,070
They'd give me that in rehab.

479
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,570
Then you should go to rehab.

480
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,700
I have a patient.

481
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,430

it's little solace,
but he went without pain...

00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,700
Well, look on the bright side.

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,300
At least you don't have to go
by Mrs. Zebalusky anymore.

485
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,670
That's got to be a relief.

I'm sorry, he's sick...

You hear my diagnosis
on the dwarf?
Still's disease.

488
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,350
Did you even consider those
ear infections, or you just
wrote it off as a dwarf thing?

489

Are you sure he's dead?

505
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,510
How's the girl?

506
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,980
Much better.

507
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,810
House was right.

508
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,250
It happens.

509
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,960
I thought
we could handle this.

510
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,360
Still's disease
never crossed my mind.

511
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,590
Don't beat yourself up,
I didn't get it, either.

512
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,500
(CHUCKLES)

513
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,770
I feel like a mob informant.

514
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,680
You want to go inside?
Got a cafeteria
in there, right?

515
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,180
I can't testify.

516
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,990
Drug addicts hurt the people
around them with their habit.

517
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,500
House has hurt
plenty of people.
You included.

518
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,800
He saves lives.
People that no one else
can save.

519
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,660
And, no matter how much
of an ass he is,

520
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,500
statistically, House
is a positive force
in the universe.

521
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,710
Pills let him do that.

522
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,270
Vicodin does not make House
a genius.

523
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,910
Whatever he does on the pills,
he can do off.

524
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,750
He is just not willing to try.

525
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,950
I won't testify against him.

526
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,030
Then we'll subpoena you.

527
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,290
Your previous statement
will be read into evidence

528
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,170
and you'll be charged
with interfering
with an investigation.

529
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,860
And you will go to jail.

530
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,210
Again, statistically,

531
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,350
better me than him.

532
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,820
Statistically, the two of you
will be in jail.

533
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,250
Dr. Cameron?

534
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,420
Come quick,
there's something wrong
with Abby.

535
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,620
It can't be too severe,
her cardiac alarm
didn't go off.

536
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,190
It's not her heart.
She's bleeding.

537
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,690
Picking up a scrip
under Zebalusky.

538
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,680
This is Dr. Wilson's patient.

539
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,740
Yeah. Wilson's busy right now.

540
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,180
What with Mr. Zebalusky dying
in agony on account
of his metastatic lung cancer

541
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,280
and not having the pills
to relieve that agony

542
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,760
because of some
moron pharmacist.

543
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,120
Sign the book.

544
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,360
The bleeding wasn't a ruptured
eardrum, ear infection
or bleeding disorder.

545
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,560
Her heart rate's climbing,
blood pressure's dropping,

546
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,360
she's on the verge
of a multi-system failure.

547
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,300
Head CT was clean,
means it's not
a neurological problem.

548
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,430
Basically we have nothing.

549
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,160
The cancer's
still on the table.

550
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,330
Spinal fluid
was negative for lymphoma.

551
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,500
What other...
Leukemia.

552
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,970
We need to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

553
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,640
None of the blood tests
suggest leukemia.

554
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,680
Cancer doesn't explain
the collapsed lung.

555
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,080
Unless a small clot
led to a pulmonary infarct.

556
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,240
It's a long shot.
Autoimmune is way more likely.

557
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,220
Autoimmune diseases
respond to steroids,
which we've given her.

558
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,410
And she got better
for a while, we stopped
the treatment too soon.

559
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,510
Because she crashed.

560
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:41,030
All we're doing is bouncing
back and forth between cancer
and autoimmune.

561
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,000
We're going in circles.

562
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,530
Give me half an hour.

563
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,170

565
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,550
Can I have a French fry?

566
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,880
Get your own.

567
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,850
You took the last ones.

568
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,480
What's wrong with you?

569
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,320
I've got spinal
muscular atrophy.

570
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,120
I guess it's not contagious.

571
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,800
Nice bear.

572
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,590
It's a dog.

573
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,190
House, it's not Still's.

574
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,770
Steroids helped until
the patient started bleeding
from the ears and mouth.

575
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,040
It's a bear.

576
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,510
His name is Bill. He's a dog.

577
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,580
You win, you can have Vicodin.

578
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,750
Words have set meanings
for a reason.

579
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,120
If you see an animal like Bill
and you try to play fetch,

580
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,380
Bill's going to eat you.

581
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,790
Because Bill's a bear.

582
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,650
Are you on something?

583
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,130
You got your hands
on pain meds.

584
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,230
Bill has fur,
four legs, and a collar.

585
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,200
He's a dog.

586
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,360
It's between cancer
and autoimmune.

587
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,870
See, that's what we call
a faulty syllogism.

588
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,340
Just because you call Bill
a dog, doesn't mean that he is

589
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,340
a dog.

590
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,550
We got to x-ray
our patient's leg.

591
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,510
Her leg looks fine.

592
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,960
Weird, huh?

593
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,860
Why aren't you detoxing?

595
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,890
What... What...

596
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,830
Normal's not normal
if you're not normal.

597
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,840
Did you just take a pill?

598
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,930
No.

599
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,740
So how does a dwarf have
completely normal
growth plates?

600
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,000
It's impossible.
We must be missing something.

601
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,940
How many pills have you taken?

602
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,680
Not nearly as many
as I'm going to take.

603
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,380
I'd forgotten how delicious
they were.

604
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,680
I didn't give them to him.

605
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,280
Can we forget my vices,
get back to my virtues?

606
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,620
We were missing the fact that

607
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,020
just because we called her
a dwarf doesn't mean
she is a dwarf.

608
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,060
Everyone assumed she was,
because of her mother.

609
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,890
There's no test
for CHH dwarfism,

610
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,130
so she lost an identity,
but we gained a symptom.

611
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,530
If she doesn't have
skeletal dwarfism,

612
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,840
then her short stature must be
caused by a growth
hormone deficiency.

613
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,000
And something's wrong
with her pituitary gland

614
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,050
and based on her size,
it's been wrong for a while.

615
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,080
So what connects
a long-term pituitary issue

616
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,280
with problems in the lungs,
liver and pancreas?

617
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,080
You guys and your bickering.
Cancer versus autoimmune.

618
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,820
Obviously, you think
it's something else.

619
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,590
Nope. I think it's both.

620
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,960
Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

621
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,360
Also known as,

622
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,530
"You got your cancer
in my autoimmune" disease.

623
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,900
The immune component responded
to the Still's treatment,

624
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,230
led to the short-term
improvement.

625
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,640
The cancer portion didn't.

626
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,470
We dismissed this earlier,
because there were no
neurological symptoms.

627
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,070
Yeah. It's not your fault.

628
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,980
The only neurological symptom
was her height.

629
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,950
Who could have noticed?

630
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,260
This is your pituitary gland.

631
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,230
This is the granuloma
that's been crushing it.

632
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,430
No pituitary equals
no growth hormone,
equals about that much.

633
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,930
She's not a dwarf?

634
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,300
Just hormonally challenged.

635
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,270
What about my mom?

636
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,180
Your mom's the real deal.
But you're just
a tiny little poseur.

637
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,710
Your recent ear infections
caused your body to release

638
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,220
a cascade of the same cells
that made the granuloma.

639
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,250
They attacked your lungs,
moved on to your liver,

640
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,450
then hitched a ride over
to your pancreas.

641
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,390
We can nuke them
with a mild course of chemo

642
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,690
and then remove the granuloma.

643
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,660
And then what?
What will happen to her then?

644
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,630
Well, let me see
if I can make this clear.

645
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,100
This pill represents

646
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,100
a pill.

647
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,300
And my mouth represents
your daughter's mouth.

648
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,010
We deposit the pill
in the mouth.

649
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,110
You may never be tall enough
to play in the WNBA,

650
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,450
but you should be able to
post up your mom, no problem.

651
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,420
What if I
don't take the pills?

652
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,590
What if you remove the thing
in my head and give me
the chemo, but not the pills?

653
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,820
Would I still get better?

654
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,590
Your body needs growth hormone
for lots of things.

655
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,860
Like

656
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,300
to grow.

657
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,430
I like who I am now.

658
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,210
Nobody your age
likes who they are now.

659
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,470
I do.

660
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,540
You like needing help
when you want something
off a high shelf?

661
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,910
Not being able to press
an elevator button
above the eighth floor?

662
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,920
Having to smell ass
every time you stand in line?

663
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,720
You don't need growth hormone.

664
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,720
It's just your ticket
out of the freak show.

665
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,270
Can't you deliver a diagnosis

666
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,810
without making her feel
that her life
isn't worth living?

667
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,310
I'm trying to help her.

668
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,810
You're trying
to make her taller.

669
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,350
Not too tall.

670
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,310
Just tall enough
to wipe her own butt.

671
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,910
Are you high?

672
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,550
Higher than you.

673
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,750
If my daughter doesn't want
to choose the easy path,

674
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,950
I won't force her to.

675
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,090
Then you're a lousy mom.

676
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,720
You want your daughter
to be a freak.

677
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,460
We're not freaks.

678
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,060
You want her to overcome
adversity.

679
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,300
Yes.
Then why stop at height?

680
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,640
Poke a stick in her eye.
Imagine how interesting
she'll be then.

681
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,370
Being little
is not the same as...

682
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,640
You and I have found out
that being normal sucks.

683
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,510
Because we're freaks.

684
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,780
The advantage of being a freak
is it makes you stronger.

685
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,220
Now, how strong
do you really want her
to have to be?

686
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,020
You told her
what you had to tell her.

687
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,190
Now you tell her you lied.

688
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,930
Even if you didn't.

689
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,500
This is who
you were supposed to be.

690
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,400
You hate normal.

691
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,580
It's not that simple.

692
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,350
If I grow,
I'll fade into the background.

693
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,940
I'll be boring.

694
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,650
We'll get you a funny hat.

695
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,460
You could never be boring.

696
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,530
You want me
to be like everybody else?

697
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,540
I want you to have
what I can't.

698
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,390
Abigail agreed...

699
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,530
Abigail agreed
to take growth hormone.

700
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,260
Who's Abigail?

701
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,970
Your non-dwarf dwarf patient.

702
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,160
Good.

703
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,230
Then the growth hormone
makes sense.

704
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,040
Christmas Eve.

705
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,580
Yeah, I know.

706
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,080
Deal expires tomorrow.

707
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,240
You have plans for tonight?

708
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,380
You worried I'm going to be
popping more pills?

709
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,960
Thought you might prefer
people over pills.

710
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,450
Hey, Mom.

711
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,880
I guess you guys
are already up
at Aunt Sarah's.

712
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,290
I'm sure Dad's in the eggnog

713
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,270
and you're probably suffering
through another
dried-out turkey.

714
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,200
I just wanted to say,
"Merry Christmas."

715
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

716
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,470
WILSON: House?

717
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,070
Are you okay?
I called three times.

718
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,580
(DOOR CLOSING)

719
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,210
<i>(HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY</i>
<i>LITTLE CHRISTMAS</i> PLAYING)

720
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,410
I'm ready to take the deal.

721
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,690
Well, that's off the table.

722
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,260
The clock
doesn't expire until...
Got new evidence.

723
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,560
We don't need Wilson anymore.

724
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,560
Thing about addicts is,

725
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,430
no matter how smart they are,

726
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,740
they are dumb
when it comes to drugs.

727
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,270
So, I've been keeping an eye
on the pharmacy log.

728
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,480
Seems some patient of Wilson's
named Zebalusky,

729
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,810
managed to pick up
his Oxy prescription
after he died.

730
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,010
(CHUCKLES)

731
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,460
Jesus walks, huh?

732
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,260
Merry Christmas.
