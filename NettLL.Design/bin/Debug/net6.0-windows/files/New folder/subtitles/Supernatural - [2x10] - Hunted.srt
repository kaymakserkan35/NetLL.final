1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,610
Dad wants us to pick up where he left off.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,180
Saving people, hunting things, the family business.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,140
You know the truth about Sammy and the other children.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,340
I've known for a while.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,790
Dad, you know the demon... 

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,710
He said he had plans for me and children like me.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,130
Do you have any idea what he meant by that?

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,850
No, I don’t.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,720
Did he say anything to you?

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,550
No. Nothing.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,080
Max, your abilities started 6, 7 months ago, right?

12
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:32,930
How'd you know that?

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,550
That's when my abilities started.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,320
You and I -- we're chosen.

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,390
For what?

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,500
I don't know.

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,890
Everyone's capable of murder.

18
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,460
Everyone.

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,810
Maybe that's what the demon's doing... 

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,070
- Pushing us, finding ways to break us.
- We don’t know what the demon wants.

21
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,090
We all have some kind of ability.

22
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,000
- Ability?
- Psychic ability.

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,240
I have visions, premonitions.

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,720
It's different for everybody.

25
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,330
The demon said he had plans for people like us.

26
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,230
What kind of plans?

27
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,930
We don't really know for sure.

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,060
Don't be afraid, Scott.

29
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:01,710
You can tell me anything.

30
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,940
You know that.

31
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,470
Whatever you say won't leave this room.

32
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,950
It started a little over a year ago.

33
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,110
Migraines at first.

34
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,700
Then I found I could do stuff.

35
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,600
What do you mean, "do stuff"?

36
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,480
I have this ability.

37
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,950
When I touch something, I can electrocute it if I want.

38
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,750
How do you know?

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,460
Did it to the neighbor's cat.

40
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,210
Its insides fried up like a hamburger.

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,830
You don't believe me.

42
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,840
I believe that you believe it.

43
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,510
Then here.

44
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,740
Want to shake on it?

45
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:10,120


46
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,370
Why would you want to kill the neighbor's cat, Scott?

47
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,750
I don’t.

48
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,730
He wants me to, and he doesn't want me to stop there.

49
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,660
Who?

50
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,180
The yellow-eyed man.

51
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,610
He comes to me in my dreams.

52
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,340
He tells me to do things -- awful things... 

53
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,390
But I tell him no.

54
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,960
"No, I don't want to! ”

55
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,230
What else does the yellow-eyed man tell you?

56
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,840
He... he has plans for me.

57
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,960
What kind of plans?

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,540


59
00:02:10,670 --> 00:03:11,010


60
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:19,550


61
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:33,370


62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:43,080


63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,590
Before dad died, he -- he told me something.

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,490
Something about you.

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,400
What?

66
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,850
Dean, what did he tell you?

67
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,770
He said that he... wanted me to watch out for you... take care of you.

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
He told you that a million times.

69
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,740
Well, this time was different.

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,410
He said that I had to... save you.

71
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,890
Save me from what?

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,430
He just said that I had to save you and nothing else mattered.

73
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,550
- And that if I couldn't, I'd... 
- You'd what, Dean?

74
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,760
I'd have to kill you.

75
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,080
He said that I might have to kill you, Sammy.

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,010
Kill me?

77
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,180
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

78
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:54,950
I don't know.

79
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,750
He must have had some reason for saying it.

80
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,280
Did he know the demon's plans for me?

81
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,980
Am I supposed to go dark side or something?

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,250
What else did he say, Dean?

83
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,400
That's it, I swear.

84
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,910
How could you not have told me this?

85
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,560
Because it was dad, and he begged me not to.

86
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,090
Who cares! Take some responsibility for yourself, Dean! 

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,050
You had no right to keep this from me! 

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,100
You think I wanted this?

89
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,060
I wish to god he'd never opened his mouth.

90
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,450
Then I wouldn't have to walk around with this screaming in my head all day! 

91
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,090
We each got to figure out what's going on, then -- what the hell all this means.

92
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,390
We do?

93
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,460
I've been thinking about this.

94
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,060
I think we should just lay low, you know.

95
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,980
At least for a while -- it would be safer.

96
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,750
- That way, I could make sure... 
- What?

97
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,160
That I don't turn evil?

98
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,780
That I don't turn into some kind of killer?

99
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,640
- I’ve never said that.
- Jeez, you're not careful, you will have to waste me one day, Dean.

100
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,670
I never said that! 

101
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,790
Damn it, Sam, this whole thing is spinning out of control.

102
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,600
All right, you're immune to some weirdo demon virus

103
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,880
and I don't even know what the hell anymore.

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,650
And you're pissed at me, and I get it.

105
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,100
That's fine.

106
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,640
I deserve it.

107
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,440
But we lay low until we figure out our next move, okay?

108
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,180
Forget it.

109
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,670
Sam, please, man.

110
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,510
Hey, please.

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,740
Just give me some time.

112
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,620
Give me some time to think, okay?

113
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,590
I'm begging you here. Please, please.

114
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,610
Honey?

115
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,980
Are you okay?

116
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,660
Oh, I just had another nightmare.

117
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,540
It's fine.

118
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,410
It's nothing.

119
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,240
Just go back to sleep.

120
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,620
Sure?

121
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,440
Yeah.

122
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,790
Okay.

123
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,660
Sam.

124
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,110
Hey, Ellen.

125
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,560
You don't seem that surprised to see me.

126
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,900
Your brother's been calling, looking for you.

127
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,410
I figured he might.

128
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,460
What's going on between you two?

129
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,140
So, um... how's Jo?

130
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,290
Well, I don't really know.

131
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,100
What do you mean?

132
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,760
I haven't seen her in weeks.

133
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,530
She sends a postcard now and again.

134
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,700
Well, what happened?

135
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,480
Well, after she worked that job with you boys

136
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,040
she decided she wanted to keep on hunting.

137
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,730
I said, "not under my roof," and she said “fine”.

138
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,780
So I'm probably the last person you want to see right now.

139
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,770
Oh, don't get me wrong.

140
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,890
I wish I could blame the hell out of you boys.

141
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,760
It would be easier.

142
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,320
The truth is, it's not your fault.

143
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,860
Sam, none of it is.

144
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:45,300
I want you to know that I forgave your daddy a long time ago... for what happened to my Bill.

145
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,530
I just don't think he ever forgave himself.

146
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,000
What did happen?

147
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,950
Um, so, why did you come here, sweetie?

148
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,190
I need help.

149
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,070
So, what am I looking for, Sam?

150
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,150
Other people, other... psychics like me.

151
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,560
As many as possible, and I need a nationwide search.

152
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,850
But I thought there was no way to track them all down.

153
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,550
Not all of them had nursery fires like you did.

154
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,590
Well... no, but some had to.

155
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,090
Start there.

156
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,160
Done... and done.

157
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,020
That was fast.

158
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,670
Well, apparently, that's my job.

159
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,250
Make the monkey dance.

160
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,770
Just tell us what you got, Ash.

161
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,440
Four folks fit the profile nationwide.

162
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,210
Born in '83, mother died in a nursery fire, the whole shebang.

163
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,610
Four?

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,290
That's it?

165
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,440
Sam Winchester from Lawrence, Kansas.

166
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,380
Max Miller from Saginaw, Michigan, Andrew Gallagher from Guthrie, Oklahoma.

167
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,520
And another name -- Scott Carey.

168
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,230
What? You got an address?

169
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,080
Kind of.

170
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,790
The Arbor Hills cemetery in Lafayette, Indiana.

171
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,220
Plot 486.

172
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,250
So he's dead?

173
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,060
Killed about a month ago.

174
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,270
Killed how?

175
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,640
Stabbed.

176
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,280
Parking lot.

177
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,630
Fuzz don't have much -- no suspects.

178
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,730
All right.

179
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,530
Thank you.

180
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,440
Where are you going?

181
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,240
Indiana.

182
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,020
Sam, I got to call Dean.

183
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,260
I've got to let him know where you are.

184
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,470
Ellen, I’m trying to find answers about who I am

185
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,580
and my brother means well, but he can't protect me from that.

186
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,160
Please.

187
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,710
You said you went to high school with Scott?

188
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,260
Uh, yes, sir, I did.

189
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,010
I just heard about what happened.

190
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,350
I'm so sorry.

191
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,930
Scotty was a good boy.

192
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,350
He changed a lot since you knew him.

193
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,770
What do you mean?

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,640
It started about a year ago with these headaches.

195
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,830
Then he got depressed, paranoid -- nightmares.

196
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,230
Nightmares?

197
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,080
Um, did he ever talk to you about his nightmares -- what he saw?

198
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,160
No, no, he closed up on me.

199
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,080
I tried to get him help, but nothing took.

200
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,500
He'd just... lock himself in his room for days.

201
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,640
You think maybe I could see his room?

202
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,130
Who are you?

203
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,860
Please.

204
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,960
You're in danger.

205
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:05,670
Okay, look, I know how all this sounds, but I am not insane, and I'm not on drugs.

206
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,930
Okay, I am normal, and this is way, way off the map for me.

207
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,720
All right, all right, just -- just calm down, okay?

208
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,520
What's your name?

209
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,250
Ava.

210
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,560
Ava Wilson.

211
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,310
Ava, I’m Sam Winchester, all right?

212
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,730
Now, you were telling me about these dreams of yours?

213
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,030
Oh, yeah, uh, okay, about a year ago, I started having these

214
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,990
like headaches, and just... nightmares, I guess.

215
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,530
And I really didn't think much of it

216
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,470
until I had this one dream where I saw this guy get stabbed in a parking lot.

217
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,610
When was this?

218
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,490
Uh, about a month ago.

219
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,460
But anyway, a couple of days later... I found this.

220
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,260
I saw this guy die days before it happened.

221
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,390
I don't know why.

222
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,160
I don't know.

223
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:06,710
Some reason, my dreams are coming true, and last night, I had another one.

224
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:07,940
Okay.

225
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,670
About you.

226
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,230
I saw you die.

227
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,220
How did you find me?

228
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,010
Oh, uh, you had motel stationery, and I Googled the motel,

229
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,020
and it was real, and so I just thought that I should warn you.

230
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,300
I don't believe this.

231
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,130
Oh, oh, of course you don’t.

232
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,210
You think I'm a total nutjob.

233
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,750
No, no, no.

234
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,600
I mean, you must be one of us.

235
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,840
Sorry, one of -- one of who?

236
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,650
One of the psychics, like me.

237
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,500
Look, Ava, I have visions, too, all right?

238
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,230
So -- so we're connected.

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,210
Okay, so... you're nuts.

240
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,380
That's great.

241
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,620
No, okay, okay. Okay, look.

242
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,710
Did your mother happen to die in a house fire?

243
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,410
No, my mother lives in Palm Beach.

244
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,290
So you don't fit the pattern, either.

245
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,010
Hello?

246
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,130
It's Ellen.

247
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,520
Hey, have you heard from Sam?

248
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,720
I have.

249
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,920
But he made me promise not to tell you where he is.

250
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,370
Come on, Ellen, please.

251
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,870
Something bad could be going on here, and I swore I'd look after that kid.

252
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,000
They say you can't protect your loved ones forever.

253
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,890
Well, I say screw that.

254
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,650
What else is family for?

255
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,290
He's in Lafayette, Indiana.

256
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,520
Thanks.

257
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,970
Why can't you just leave town, please, before you blow up?

258
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,020
No, I can’t.

259
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,510
Oh, god. Why not?

260
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,170
Because there's something going on here, Ava, with you, with me.

261
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,350
I mean, there are others like us out there

262
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,690
and we're all a part of something, and I've got to figure out what.

263
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,880
Okay, you know what?

264
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,630
Screw you, buddy.

265
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,560
Okay, 'cause I'm a secretary from Peoria

266
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,970
and I'm not part of anything.

267
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,230
Do you see this?

268
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,570
I am getting married in eight weeks.

269
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,640
I am supposed to be at home addressing invitations

270
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,300
which I am way behind on, by the way.

271
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,870
But instead, I drove out here to save your weirdo ass.

272
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,680
But if you just want to stay here and die, fine.

273
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,580
Me?

274
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,850
I'm due back on Planet Earth.

275
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,090
Don't you want to know why this is happening?

276
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,160
I mean, don't these visions scare the hell out of you?

277
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,950
'Cause if you walk out that door right now, you might never know the truth.

278
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,000
I need your help.

279
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,720
So, miss Wilson, you're new in town?

280
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
That's right.

281
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,440
And what made you decide to seek out therapy?

282
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,500
I have no idea.

283
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,530
No?

284
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:03,320
No, I mean, I’m feeling really, super... anxious right now.

285
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,560
Okay, anything else?

286
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,410
Uh... holy crap! 

287
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,630
What?

288
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,520
I just remembered, when I was a kid, I swallowed

289
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,010
like, eight things of pop rocks, and then drank a whole can of coke.

290
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,580
You don't think that that counts as a suicide attempt, do you?

291
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,680
You okay?

292
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,870
Am I okay?

293
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,470
Yeah.

294
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,350
I just helped you steal some dead guy's confidential psych files.

295
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,980
I'm awesome! 

296
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,210
Scott: It started a little over a year ago.

297
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,240
Migraines at first.

298
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,520
Then I found I could do stuff.

299
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,910
What do you mean, "do stuff"?

300
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,660
I have this ability.

301
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,570
When I touch something, I can electrocute it if I want.

302
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,860
Oh, thank god you're okay.

303
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh, you're better than okay.

304
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,350
Sam, you sly dog.

305
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,330
What else does the yellow-eyed man say?

306
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,980
He has plans for me.

307
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,210
He says there's a war coming,

308
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,160
and people like me -- we're gonna be the soldiers.

309
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,550
Everything is about to change.

310
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,850
He's not talking about us, right?

311
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,590
Yeah, I think he is.

312
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,900
Well... but how can we turn into that?

313
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,210
I don't...

314
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,700
Get down! 

315
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,810
Oh, my god, what's happening?

316
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,260
Gordon! 

317
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,030
You do that to my brother, I’ll kill you! 

318
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,000
Dean, wait! 

319
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,370
Wait, I don't understand.

320
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,060
Shouldn't we be talking to the cops?

321
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,690
Trust me, they wouldn't do us much good.

322
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,070
These are .223 caliber -- subsonic rounds.

323
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,890
The guy must have put a suppressor on the rifle.

324
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,120
Dude, who are you?

325
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,600
Oh, I just, uh...

326
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,970
I just watch a lot of “T. J. Hooker”.

327
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,250
Who you calling?

328
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,580
My brother.

329
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,430
I think we definitely need help.

330
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,920
Hello?

331
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,900
Dean.

332
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,900
Sam, I’ve been looking for you.

333
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,930
Yeah, look, I’m in Indiana.

334
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,080
Lafayette.

335
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,940
I know.

336
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,900
You do?

337
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,540
Yeah, I talked to Ellen.

338
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,310
I just got here myself.

339
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,260
It's a real funky town.

340
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,640
You ditched me, Sammy.

341
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,070
Yeah, I’m sorry.

342
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,050
Look, right now, there's someone after me.

343
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,810
What? Who?

344
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,750
I don't know.

345
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,440
That's what we need to find out.

346
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,270
Where are you?

347
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,630
I'm staying at 5637 Monroe Street.

348
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,810
Why don't you meet me here?

349
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
Yeah, sure.

350
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,920
Now, was that so hard?

351
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,460
Bite me.

352
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,100
What is it?

353
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,480
My brother's in trouble.

354
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,450
What?

355
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,820
He gave me a code word.

356
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,310
Someone's got a gun on him.

357
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,600
Code word?

358
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,610
Yeah.

359
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,040
“Funky town.”

360
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,480
Well, he thought of it.

361
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,550
It's kind of a long story.

362
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,370
Come on.

363
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,400
Gordy, I know me and Sam ain't exactly your favorite people

364
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,440
but don't you think this is a little extreme?

365
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,740
Oh, you think this is revenge?

366
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,370
We did leave you tied up in your own mess for three days.

367
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,430
Which was awesome.

368
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,760
Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.

369
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah, I was definitely planning on whupping your ass for that.

370
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,050
That's not what this is.

371
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,360
This isn't personal.

372
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,880
I'm not a killer, Dean.

373
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,410
I'm a hunter.

374
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,800
And your brother is fair game.

375
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,910
I don't think I should leave.

376
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,020
I want you out of harm's way, Ava.

377
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,470
What about you?

378
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,500
Harm's way doesn't really bother me.

379
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,350
No, but you are walking right into my vision.

380
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,440
I mean, this is how you die.

381
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,510
It doesn't matter.

382
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,730
It's my brother.

383
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,450
Maybe I can help.

384
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,510
You've done all you can.

385
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,760
Just -- just go back to your fiancé?

386
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,910
Are you sure?

387
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,510
Yes, I’m sure.

388
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,130
Go home, Ava.

389
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,930
You'll be safe there.

390
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:00,020
Well, just... promise me you'll call, then.

391
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,330
When you get your brother, just let me know that everything's all right.

392
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,350
I promise.

393
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,850
See, I was doing an exorcism down in Louisiana.

394
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,130
A teenage girl.

395
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,290
It seemed routine.

396
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,980
Some low-level demon.

397
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,570
But between all the jabbering and the head-spinning,

398
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,960
the damn thing muttered something about a coming war.

399
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:20,900
I don't think it meant to.

400
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,310
It just kind of slipped out.

401
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,390
But it was too late.

402
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,520
It piqued my interest.

403
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,950
And you can really make a demon talk, you got the right tools.

404
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,220
What happened to the girl it was possessing?

405
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,910
She didn't make it.

406
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,440
Well, you're a son of a bitch.

407
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,620
That's my mama you're talking about.

408
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:51,890
Anyway, this demon tells me they have soldiers to fight in this coming war.

409
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,680
Humans fighting on hell's side.

410
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,730
You believe that?

411
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,380
I mean, they're psychics, so they're not exactly pure humans.

412
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,790
But still, what kind of worthless scumbag you got to be to turn against your own race?

413
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,340
But you know the biggest kick in the ass?

414
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,310
This demon said I knew one of them...

415
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,740
Our very own Sammy Winchester.

416
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,720
Well, this is...

417
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,780
This is a whole new level of moronic, even for you.

418
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,850
Yeah?

419
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,370
Come on, Dean.

420
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,100
I know about Sam's visions.

421
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,210
I know everything.

422
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,250
Really?

423
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,600
Because a demon told you?

424
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,050
Yeah, and it wasn't lying.

425
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,410
Hey, Dean, I’m not some reckless yahoo, okay?

426
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,860
I did my homework.

427
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,080
I made damn sure it was true.

428
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,530
Look, you got your roadhouse connections.

429
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,030
I got mine.

430
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,370
It's how I found Sammy in the first place.

431
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,140
About a month ago, I found another one of these freaks here in town.

432
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,830
He could deep-fry a person just by touching them.

433
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,260
Yeah, did he kill anyone?

434
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,000
Besides Mr. Tinkles, the cat, no.

435
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,890
But he was working up to it.

436
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,550
They're all gonna be killers, Dean.

437
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,760
We got to take them all out, and that means Sammy, too.

438
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,660
You think Sam's stupid enough to walk through that front door?

439
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,990
No, I don’t.

440
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,570
Especially since I'm sure you found a way to warn him.

441
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,590
You really think I'm that stupid?

442
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:47,600
No, Sammy's gonna scope the place first, see me covering the front door.

443
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,290
So he's gonna take the back.

444
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,890
And when he does, he'll hit the tripwire.

445
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,270
Then... boom.

446
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,660
Sam's not gonna fall for a frickin' tripwire.

447
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,220
Maybe you're right.

448
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,720
That's why I'll have a second one.

449
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,270
Hey, look, I’m sorry.

450
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,930
I wish I didn't have to do this. I really do.

451
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:32,520
But for what it's worth, it will be quick.

452
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,270
Come on, man.

453
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,920
I know Sam, okay, better than anyone.

454
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,440
He's got more of a conscience than I do.

455
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,940
I mean, the guy feels guilty surfing the internet for porn.

456
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,620
Maybe you're right, but one day, he's gonna be a monster.

457
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,710
How?

458
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,620
Huh?

459
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,070
How's a guy like Sam become a monster?

460
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,680
It beats me, but he will.

461
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,770
No, you don't know that! 

462
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,860
I'm surprised at you, Dean.

463
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,960
Getting all emotional.

464
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,130
I had heard you were more of a professional than this.

465
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:40,150
Let’s say that you are cruising around in that car of yours

466
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:45,150
and you have Adolf Hitler at riding shotgun, right?

467
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,060
Back when he was just some goofy, crappy artist.

468
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,860
But you knew what he was gonna turn into someday.

469
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,360
You'd take him out.

470
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,060
No questions, am I right?

471
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:58,840
That's not Sam.

472
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,730
Yes, it is.

473
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,060
You just can't see it yet.

474
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,210
Dean, it's his destiny.

475
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,810
Look, I’m sympathetic.

476
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,840
He's your brother.

477
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,290
You love the guy.

478
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,510
This has got to hurt like hell for you.

479
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,620
But here's the thing.

480
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,750
It would have wrecked him, but your dad

481
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,080
if it really came right down to it,

482
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,500
he would have had the stones to do the right thing here.

483
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,980
So, you're telling me you're not the man he is?

484
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,640
You hear him?

485
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,990
Here he comes.

486
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,530
Hold on.

487
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,320
Not yet.

488
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,730
Let's wait and see.

489
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,170
Sorry, Dean.

490
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,900
Drop the gun.

491
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,960
You shouldn't take your shoes off around here.

492
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,150
You might get tetanus.

493
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,390
Put it down now! 

494
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,800
You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Sammy?

495
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,960
'Cause your brother -- he thinks you're some kind of saint.

496
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,770
Yeah.

497
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,680
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

498
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,990
See, that's what I said.

499
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,020
You're no better than the filthy things you hunt.

500
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,760
Do it.

501
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,710
Do it! 

502
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,670
Show your brother the killer you really are, Sammy.

503
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,700
It's “Sam”.

504
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,620
Son of a bitch.

505
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,460
Dean, no.

506
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,480
I let him live once.

507
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,940
I'm not making the same mistake twice.

508
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,280
Trust me.

509
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,050
Gordon's taken care of.

510
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,740
Come on.

511
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,840
You call this taken care of?

512
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,330
What the hell are we doing?

513
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,530
Just trust me on this.

514
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,710
Drop your weapons! 

515
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,290
Get down on your knees! 

516
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,090
Anonymous tip.

517
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,720
You're a fine, upstanding citizen, Sam.

518
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,380
Gordon Walker was hunting Sam?

519
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,910
Somebody over there can't keep their frickin' mouth shut.

520
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,080
And you honestly think that it was me or Ash or Jo? No way.

521
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,000
Who else knows about Sam, huh?

522
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,950
Well, you must have been talking to somebody.

523
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,100
You can say a lot of things about us

524
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,870
but we aren't disloyal, and we're not stupid.

525
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,400
We haven't breathed a word of this.

526
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,630
Gordon said he had roadhouse connections, Ellen.

527
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,770
And this roadhouse is full of other hunters.

528
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,520
They're all smart.

529
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,150
They're good trackers, each of them with their own patterns and connections.

530
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,850
Hell, I could name 12 of them right now that are capable of putting this together.

531
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,280
I am sorry about what happened, Dean,

532
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:53,090
but I can't control these people or what they choose to believe.

533
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,000
Hey, Ava, it's Sam... again.

534
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,240
Um... call me when you get this.

535
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,760
Just want to make sure you got home okay.

536
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,720
All right, bye.

537
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,590
Everything all right?

538
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,360
Yeah, I hope so.

539
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,380
Well, Gordon should be reaching for the soap for the next few years, at least.

540
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:21,950
Yeah, if they pin Scott care’s murder on him... and if he doesn't bust out.

541
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,740
- Dude, you ever take off like that again... 
- what?

542
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,590
You'd kill me?

543
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,540
That's so not funny.

544
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,860
All right.

545
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,650
All right.

546
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,840
So, where to next, then?

547
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,840
One word -- Amsterdam.

548
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,750
Come on, man, I hear the coffee shops don't even serve coffee.

549
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,230
I'm not gonna just ditch the Job.

550
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,340
Screw the Job.

551
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,790
Screw it, man.

552
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,880
I'm sick of the job anyway.

553
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,870
We don't get paid.

554
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,260
We don't get thanked.

555
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,610
The only thing we get is bad luck.

556
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,510
Well, come on, dude, you're a hunter.

557
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,680
It's what you were meant to do.

558
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,560
I am not meant to do anything. I don't believe in that destiny crap.

559
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,490
You mean you don't believe in my destiny?

560
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,370
Whatever.

561
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,570
Look, Dean, I’ve tried running before.

562
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,770
I mean, I ran all the way to California, and look what happened.

563
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,030
You can't run from this, and you can't protect me.

564
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,980
I can try.

565
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,780
Thanks for that.

566
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,180
Look, Dean, I’m gonna keep hunting.

567
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,490
I mean, whatever's coming, I’m taking it head on

568
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,070
so if you really want to watch my back

569
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,200
then I guess you're gonna have to stick around.

570
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,660
Bitch.

571
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,310
Jerk.

572
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,800
You calling that Ava girl again?

573
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,230
You sweet on her or something?

574
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,380
She's engaged, Dean.

575
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,450
So?

576
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,850
What's the point in saving the world, you can't get a little nookie once in a while?

577
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,930
What?

578
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,360
Just a feeling.

579
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,320
How far is it to Peoria?

580
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,860
Hello?

581
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,650
Is anybody home?

582
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,860
My god.

583
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,360
Hey.

584
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,290
Sulfur.

585
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,570
The demon's been here.

586
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,950
Ava.
