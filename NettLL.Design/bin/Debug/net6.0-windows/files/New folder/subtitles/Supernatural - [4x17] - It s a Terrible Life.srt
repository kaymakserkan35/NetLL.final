1
00:00:02,693 --> 00:00:04,285
???

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:06,082
Because we have a work for you.

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,970
You got a lot
to learn, boy.

4
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:14,205
Is it true?
Did i break the first seal?

5
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:16,507
Did i start l this?
Yes.

6
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:18,343
Why didn't you just
leave me there, then?

7
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:21,379
The righteous man
who begins it

8
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:23,714
is the only one
who can finish it.

9
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:26,151
You have to stop it.

10
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:28,653
Our fate
rests with you.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,355
Find someone else.

12
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,125
It's not me.

13
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,902
'cause he gets up
in the morning ?

14
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:47,872
And he goes to work at 9 ?

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,908
And he comes back home
at 5:30 ?

16
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:53,611
Gets the same train
every time ?

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,582
'cause his world is built
'round punctuality ?

18
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,484
It never fails ?

19
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,253
And he's oh so good ?

20
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:03,688
And he's oh ...  ?

21
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,995
According to
the wall street journal,

22
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:12,097
citigroup inc.
Is negotiating with... 

23
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:16,101
he's a well-respected man
about town ?

24
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:21,239
Doing the best things
so conservatively ?

25
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:24,275
And he likes
his own backyard ?

26
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:27,012
And he likes his fags
the best ?

27
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,947
'cause he's better
than the rest ?

28
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:33,018
And his own sweat
smells the best ?

29
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:35,720
And he hopes to grab
his father's loot ?

30
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:38,689
When pater passes on ?

31
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:41,792
'cause he's oh so good ?

32
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,727
And he's... ?

33
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:45,263
All i want to know is,

34
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,032
when are they gonna have another
show like "project runway"?

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,201
... and his mind ?

36
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,139
He's a well-respected man
about town ?

37
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:55,773
Doing the best things so... ?

38
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:57,442
Net profitability aside,

39
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,178
it's the client-retention rate
that concerns me,

40
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,612
vis-?vis
maximizing return on sales.

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,049
Buzz me back once you've seen
the spreadsheets.

42
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:05,583
Mr. Adler.
Dean.

43
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,219
Good stuff.
Good stuff?

44
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:09,421
Big things.

45
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:11,756
Good stuff.
Good stuff.

46
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:14,125
Oh, i hear you. I haven't
been to the gym in ages.

47
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:15,326
Carrying a little bloat around
myself.

48
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:19,531
Yeah, it's a sedentary
lifestyle, my man. No two ways.

49
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,533
All right,
tell me one more time.

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,070
You said, uh, lemon
and ...  what was it?

51
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:27,072
Cayenne and maple syrup.

52
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,106
Are you serious?

53
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:29,840
How much did you lose?

54
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:33,010
He's a well-respected man
about town ?

55
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:37,048
Doing the best things
so conservatively ?

56
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,899
Do i know you?

57
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,301
I don't think so.

58
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:04,209
I'm sorry, man.
You just look really familiar.

59
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,712
Save it for
the health club, pal.

60
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,311
Tech support.
This is sam wesson.

61
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:45,383
Okay. Uh, well, did you try
turning it off and then on?

62
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:47,685
Okay, go ahead
and turn it off.

63
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:50,054
No, no, no, no.
Just ...  just off.

64
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,556
All right, give it a second.

65
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:53,057
Turn it back on.

66
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:56,461
Okay, is it ... 
is it printing now?

67
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,428
Great.

68
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:59,230
Anytime.

69
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:02,800
Hey.

70
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,001
Yo.

71
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,937
What do you think
of, uh, mimi?

72
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:08,139
She's okay.

73
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,407
Might have to
hit that.

74
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,842
Oh, dude, that's totally
age-inappropriate.

75
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,010
Experience.

76
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,712
Uh, trifocals.

77
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,248
There's a milf there, sam.
I just know it.

78
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:18,849
Maybe a gmilf.

79
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:19,617
Come on.

80
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,851
Coffee break?

81
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,753
Yeah, for sure.

82
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,957
Paul,
time for a refuel, buddy.

83
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:28,926
Sorry. No time.

84
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,562
Since when?

85
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,497
Dude, we get paid
by the hour.

86
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,998
Working!

87
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,333
Okay.

88
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,834
He seems stressed.

89
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,269
Probably just freaked

90
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,771
'cause he got busted
surfing porn on the internet.

91
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,207
No, no, no.
Wait. When?

92
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:44,542
He got sent up to h.r.
Yesterday.

93
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,078
Guess they put
the fear of god in him.

94
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,957
Ian! Dude!

95
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,393
Just doing a little shopping.
Running low at home.

96
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,597
So, sam... 

97
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:07,798
had any of those
dreams lately?

98
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,134
What?
Don't be like that.

99
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:11,836
Come on. It's the highlight
of my day.

100
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:13,771
I never should have told you
in the first place.

101
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,206
They're genius!

102
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,476
Don't hold out on me, dude.
Share with the class.

103
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,378
You're just gonna
be a dick about it.

104
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,847
What?! No way!

105
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:25,483
I won't say a word ... 
total respect.

106
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:27,051
Go.

107
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:35,426
I dreamt that i saved
a grim reaper named
tessa from demons.

108
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:38,696
Classic!

109
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:42,166
How much d&d did youou play
when you were a kid?

110
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,601
Oh, my.

111
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,937
Okay, so you're
rescuing the grim reaper.

112
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:48,205
You're a hero.

113
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:50,808
I mean, thank god
we got harry potter here

114
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:53,077
to save us all
from the apocalypse.

115
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,479
Dick.

116
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,414
Wird.

117
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:08,519
Can i ask you
a question?

118
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:10,521
Look, man, i told you,
i'm not into the ... 

119
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,022
oh, dude, come on.
I'm not either.

120
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,424
I just want to ask you
one question.

121
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:15,793
Sure.

122
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:23,133
What do you think
about ghosts?

123
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:26,771
Ghosts?

124
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:29,139
Do you believe in them?

125
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:33,644
Uh, tell you the truth, i've
never given it much thought.

126
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,113
Vampires?

127
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,582
What?

128
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:38,916
Why?

129
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,922
'cause i've been having
some... weird dreams lately.

130
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,056
You know what i mean?

131
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:49,159
No, not really.

132
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:50,795
So... 

133
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:55,199
you've never had
any... weird dreams?

134
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,234
All right, look, man,
uh... 

135
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,871
i don't know you, okay?

136
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,706
But i'm gonna do
a public service

137
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:06,377
and, uh, let you know that ... 
that you over-share.

138
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,857
Did you turn it off, then on?

139
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,159
All right,
well, let's try that.

140
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:24,061
No, no, it's fine.
I'll wait.

141
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:35,339
Is it printing now?

142
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:36,774
Oh, that's great.

143
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:38,275
Anytime.

144
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:42,279
Whatcha doin'?

145
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:45,082
Nothing.

146
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,885
You get an e-mail
from human resources?

147
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:49,186
No. Why?

148
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:52,890
Damn it.
Guess it's just me, then.

149
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,327
I'm supposed to, quote,
"report to h.r.," unquote.

150
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:58,228
Well, they're probably
finally busting you

151
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,864
for snaking
all those office supplies.

152
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:02,600
I hope they spank me.

153
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,609
No, no, no, no, no, no.

154
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,844
Come on!

155
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,713
Don't do this to me.
Please!

156
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,682
Hey, man. You okay?

157
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:19,116
It froze.

158
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,119
They're crap, paul.
They freeze all the time.

159
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,221
You don't understand.
When ...  when i rebooted,
everything was gone.

160
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,389
A whole day's work ... 
deleted.

161
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:26,624
Well, did you back up?

162
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,793
No, i didn't back up.

163
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,562
I wish to god i backed up,
but i didn't.

164
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,931
I'll get it back.
I'll find it.

165
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:34,966
It's somewhere.

166
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:35,867
Find it!

167
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:40,304
Paul, it's okay, man.
These things happen.

168
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:46,978
Come on!

169
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,413
Come on!

170
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,317
Come on!

171
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:57,321
Come on!

172
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,156
Please! Please!

173
00:10:04,162 --> 00:10:06,531
All that work... 

174
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:09,133
gone.

175
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,935
Failed.

176
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:19,026
Something em not right ?

177
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:22,029
Uh, yeah.
Try the whole thing.

178
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:23,998
I'm telling you, man... 

179
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,966
i'll never eat popcorn
again.

180
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:29,837
Yeah, right.

181
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:43,017
Two weeks?

182
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:47,689
Hey, why would someone
kill themselves

183
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:51,025
two weeks before
they were supposed to retire?

184
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:54,362
I mean, paul was two weeks
from freedom.

185
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,433
He should have been... 
happy, right?

186
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,835
I don't have time
for this, sam.

187
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,637
That's very funny.

188
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,444
What's with you?

189
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:12,847
I'm working.
It's important.

190
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:16,016
H.r. Bust your balls
or something?

191
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:17,619
You're wearing
the shirt.

192
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:20,821
Did you shave?

193
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,259
Tech support.
This is ian.

194
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:26,728
Be right up.

195
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:31,098
I have to go up to 22,
speak to a manager.

196
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:42,877
Hi. "Ian," is it?

197
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:45,212
Yeah, come on in.

198
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,515
Yesterday,
you filled out a 445-t.

199
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,385
And, uh, no problem ... 
just a ...  just a few errors.

200
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:52,487
I mean, we did just switch over
to vista, so i'm sure

201
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,689
you're used to filling out
the dash-r's, am i right?

202
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,023
Oh, no.

203
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:57,558
No, no, no.
It's fine. It's fine.

204
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,059
I just need you
to redo one today

205
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:00,861
so i can get the show
on the road with the invoicing.

206
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,530
Oh, my god.

207
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,532
No, it's fine. Just re-file it,
and we're square.

208
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,100
I can't believe i did this.
I can't ... 

209
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:09,003
i can't believe it.
I... can't believe i did this.

210
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,171
Hey, guy, come on ... 

211
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,739
no, no.

212
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,008
It affected profits.
It ...  i screwed up.

213
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:16,311
I-i can't ... 
i can't ... 

214
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,745
i am so sorry.

215
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,914
How could i do that?

216
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,650
I failed sandover.

217
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,519
I failed the company.

218
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,120
Uh, why don't you
sit down, ian?

219
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:27,154
No.

220
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:28,556
Ian. Ian!

221
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:29,557
Hey!

222
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,895
Ian, hey.

223
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,464
Just chill out, man.
Okay?

224
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,680
H-hey, maybe we should
get out of here, huh?

225
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,981
Come on.

226
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:54,816
Ian.

227
00:13:58,554 --> 00:13:59,286
Look at me.

228
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,720
Somebody help me!

229
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:36,991
I, uh, i-i followed him
into the bathroom.

230
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:39,394
He was, uh... 

231
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,529
he was standing there
in front of the mirror,

232
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,030
and then ... 

233
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,705
... and, uh, he stabbed himself
in the neck.

234
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,206
I'm sorry.
That's, uh... 

235
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,919
tech support.
This is sam.

236
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:07,622
I need to see you
in my office ...  now.

237
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:14,962
Come on in.
Shut the door.

238
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,770
Who the hell are you?

239
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,507
I'm not sure i know.

240
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:27,542
What the hell
does that mean?

241
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:34,014
Sam wesson.
I started here three weeks ago.

242
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:37,952
All right.

243
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,187
You cornered me
in the elevator,

244
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,690
talking about ghosts.

245
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,592
And now... 

246
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,362
now what?

247
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,366
Now nothing.

248
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,001
I, uh... 

249
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,637
so, you started working here
three weeks ago, huh?

250
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,373
Me too.

251
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,911
It's, uh,
master cleanse.

252
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,312
You tried it?

253
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,682
Phenomenal. Detoxes you
like nobody's business.

254
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:14,922
When you were
in that bathroom with ian... 

255
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,591
did you see something?

256
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:20,595
I don't know.
I don't know what i saw.

257
00:16:20,662 --> 00:16:22,396
Wait.
Are you saying that ... 

258
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:26,734
did you... see a ghost?

259
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:28,703
I was freaking out.

260
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,237
The guy penciled
his damn neck.

261
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:31,772
You did, didn't you?

262
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,407
Okay, listen ... 

263
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:35,676
what if these suicides... 
aren't suicides?

264
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,712
I mean,
w-what if there's something... 

265
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,380
not natural?

266
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,917
So, what ... 
ghosts are real?

267
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:46,320
And they're responsible for all
the dead bodies around here?

268
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:47,922
Is that
what you're telling me?

269
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,057
Look... 

270
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,159
i know
it sounds crazy.

271
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:55,029
But yes ... 
that's what i'm telling you.

272
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:56,497
Based on what?

273
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:02,970
Instinct?

274
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:09,777
I've got
the same instinct.

275
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,012
Seriously?

276
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,414
You know those dreams
i was telling you about?

277
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:15,382
I was dreaming about ghosts.

278
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,751
Yeah?

279
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,053
And then it turns out
that there's a real ghost.

280
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,423
So you're telling me that
your dreams are special visions

281
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,724
and you're
some kind of psychic?

282
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:27,161
No. I mean
that would be nuts.

283
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:28,596
I-i'm just saying,

284
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:31,398
something weird is definitely
going on around here, right?

285
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,400
So i've been
digging around a little.

286
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,770
I think i found a connection
between the two guys.

287
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,443
You broke into
their e-mail accounts?

288
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,146
I used... some skills
that i happen to have

289
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:49,316
to... 
satisfy my curiosity.

290
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:51,151
Nice.

291
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,154
Yeah, okay.

292
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:57,257
So, it turns out ian and paul
both got this same e-mail

293
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:00,194
telling them
to report to h.r., room 1444.

294
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:01,829
H.r.'s on 7.

295
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:02,730
Exactly.

296
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:08,736
Should we go
check this out?

297
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,337
Like... right now?

298
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:15,542
No. No, it's getting late.
You're right.

299
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:23,050
I am dying
to check this out right now.

300
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:23,951
Right?

301
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,841
Hello?

302
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,448
Hello?

303
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,970
How'd you know
how to do that?

304
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,039
I have no idea.

305
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,528
Holy crap, dude.

306
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:32,997
Yeah.

307
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,766
I could use a beer.

308
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,600
Oh, sorry, man.
I'm on the cleanse.

309
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,535
I got rid of all the carbs
in the house.

310
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,240
Hey, how the hell
did you know

311
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,408
that ghosts
are scared of wrenches?

312
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,010
Crazy, right?

313
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,179
And nice job
kicking in that door, too.

314
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,446
That was very jet li.

315
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,415
What are you ...  like,
a black belt or something?

316
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,984
No.

317
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,052
I have no clue
how i did that.

318
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,224
It's like... 
we've done this before.

319
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,993
What do you mean,
"before"?

320
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,828
Like "shirley maclaine"
before?

321
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,764
No.

322
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,699
I just can't shake
this feeling like i ... 

323
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,835
like i don't belong here,
you know what i mean?

324
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,204
Like i should do something more
than sit in a cubicle.

325
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,473
I think most people who work
in a cubicle feel that same way.

326
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,742
No. Well, look,
it's more than that.

327
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,912
Like ...  like
i don't like my job.

328
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,848
I don't like this town.
I don't like my clothes.

329
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,750
I don't like
my own last name.

330
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,287
I ...  i don't know
how else to explain it,

331
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,588
except that... 

332
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:34,225
it feels like i should be
doing something else.

333
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,394
There's just... 
something in my blood.

334
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:44,068
Like i was destined
for something different.

335
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,703
What about you?

336
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,839
You ever feel that way?

337
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,443
I don't believe
in destiny.

338
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,012
I do believe
in dealing with

339
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,748
what's right in front of us,
though.

340
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,953
All right.
So, what do we do now?

341
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,521
We do what i do best,
sammy.

342
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,589
Research.

343
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,691
Okay.

344
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,963
Did you just call me
"sammy"?

345
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,364
Did i?

346
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,168
I think you did.

347
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,036
Yeah.

348
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,671
Don't.

349
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,041
Sorry.

350
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,111
Oh, jackpot!

351
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,346
What you got?

352
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,646
I just found
the best site ever.

353
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,316
Real,
actual ghost hunters.

354
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,353
These guys are genius.
Check it out.

355
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,091
Instructional videos?

356
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,427
We know
why you're watching.

357
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,762
You've got a problem.

358
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:45,796
A ghost problem.

359
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,431
A ghost-related problem.

360
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,902
A-a ghost ... 
it's like a ghost-adjacent ... 

361
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,036
it's like a problem,
and the ghost ... 

362
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,804
whatever.

363
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,839
Well, you've come
to the right place.

364
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,541
The only decent place,
really,

365
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,810
because the ghostfacers
know how to solve it.

366
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,611
Period.

367
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,013
Watch and learn.

368
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,948
See, the first step
in any supernatural fight... 

369
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,784
figure out
what you're up against.

370
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,725
That's him.
That's the ghost.

371
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,063
P.t. Sandover ... 
died 1916.

372
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,998
Devoted his life
to his work.

373
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,766
No wife, no kids.

374
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,502
Used to say
he was the company

375
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,705
and his very blood
pumped through the building.

376
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:31,642
Wow. Okay.
So, slight workaholic.

377
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,244
Maybe he's still here,

378
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,712
you know, watching over
the company ... 

379
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,181
even killing for it.

380
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,450
Plus, turns out
this isn't the first time

381
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:42,353
people started killing
themselves in the building.

382
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,322
1929 ...  the crash.

383
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,158
Yeah, but lots of guys
jumped off of lots of
high-rises that year.

384
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,360
How many companies
had 17 suicides?

385
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,731
Okay, so, p.t. Sandover ... 
protector of the company.

386
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,301
His ghost wakes up
and becomes active

387
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,104
during times
of grave economic distress.

388
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,706
Well, i mean, the worst
time we've seen since
the great depression... 

389
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,874
is now.

390
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,809
Yeah, now sucks.

391
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,445
My portfolio's
in the sewer.

392
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,213
I don't even
want to talk about it.

393
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,284
So, sandover's
helping the bottom line... 

394
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,219
by zapping
some model employees.

395
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,356
Yeah.
I mean, ian and paul ... 

396
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,359
it was like he turned them
into different people.

397
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,260
Perfect worker bees ... 
exactly.

398
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,661
So devoted
to the company

399
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,231
that they would commit hara-kiri
if they failed it.

400
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,502
One more
interesting fact ... 

401
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,437
the building
wasn't always that high.

402
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,406
Used to be 14 floors.

403
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,709
And the room where
the ghost attacked, 1444 ... 

404
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:42,313
once upon a time,
that was the old man's office.

405
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,248
Once you've got that thing
in your sights... 

406
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,616
you kill it!

407
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,187
Using special
ghost-hunting weapons.

408
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,722
First, salt.

409
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,758
It's like acid
to ghosts.

410
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,293
Burny acid.

411
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,828
Not lsd.

412
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,096
No. It's a bad trip
for ghosts.

413
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,664
Next up ...  iron.

414
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,233
That's why
the wrench worked.

415
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,601
Pure power in your hand ... 
dissipates ghosts instantly.

416
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,970
Next little trick ... 

417
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,007
we learned this from
those useless douche bags... 

418
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,409
that we hate... 

419
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,644
... the winchesters.

420
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:15,346
Gun.
Shotgun shell.

421
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,948
Pack it up
with fresh rock salt.

422
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:18,849
Very effective.

423
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,151
Very effective.

424
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,253
Winchesters
still suck ass, though.

425
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,055
Affirmative.

426
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,956
Suckage ...  major.

427
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:31,095
Where do we even
get a gun?

428
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,696
Gun store?

429
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,998
Isn't there, like, some kind
of waiting period or something?

430
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,400
I think so.
Then how in the hell?

431
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,136
I don't know, man. It seems
pretty impossible, honestly.

432
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,438
Right.

433
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,440
The aforementioned
super-annoying

434
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,175
winchester
douche-nozzles

435
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,377
also taught us
this one other thing.

436
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,179
You have to burn
the remains.

437
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,451
Okay, this next part
gets a little gross.

438
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:57,488
Sometimes... you might
have to... dig up the body.

439
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,791
Sorry.
It's illegal
in some states.

440
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:01,892
All states.

441
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,461
Possibly all states.

442
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,662
Sandover was cremated.

443
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,131
What?

444
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,532
So,
what do we do now?

445
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,634
Now, if the deceased
has been cremated... 

446
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,470
don't panic.
Don't panic.

447
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,805
You just got to look
for some other remains.

448
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,141
Hair in a locket, maybe,
fingernails, baby teeth ... 

449
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,041
milk teeth.

450
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,646
Genetic material. You know
what we're talking about.

451
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,582
Go find it.

452
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,817
Fight well,
young lions.

453
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:27,884
Godspeed.

454
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,556
Set your cellphone
to walkie-talkie

455
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,091
in case
we get separated.

456
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,127
How the hell are we gonna find
some ancient speck of dna

457
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,794
in a skyscraper?

458
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,998
Well, that creepy
storeroom used to be
sandover's office, right?

459
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,493
What the hell
are you doing here?

460
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,231
Uh... nothing.
I just ... 

461
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,432
come with me.

462
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:24,208
Man, l-listen ...  it's okay.
I-i work here.

463
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,143
Whatever.
Tell it to the cops.

464
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,060
Well, come on.

465
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,496
What?

466
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,831
Last time
this happened,

467
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:23,100
it took them two hours
to get here.

468
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,401
Let's just wait.

469
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,168
Seriously ... 
i'll wait.

470
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,204
Look, i don't have
the rest of my life here.

471
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,248
Hey. You okay?

472
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,495
Call you back.

473
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:27,422
????

474
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:29,422
Yeah.
Listen, i think i got it.

475
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,824
Meet me on 22.

476
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:32,191
Okay. Yeah.

477
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:34,226
Just, uh... 
take the stairs.

478
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:45,171
That's a lot of blood.

479
00:29:46,941 --> 00:29:48,407
Yeah, i know.

480
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:50,076
Right.

481
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:51,845
So, uh, in there.

482
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:53,312
P.t. Sandover's gloves.

483
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,482
Yeah.

484
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:57,383
How much you want to
bet there's a little
smidge of dna in there?

485
00:29:57,451 --> 00:29:59,886
You know, like a
fingernail clipping or a
hair or two. Something.

486
00:29:59,954 --> 00:30:01,053
So, you ready?

487
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:04,958
I have no idea.

488
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:06,860
Me neither.

489
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:13,199
Go for it.

490
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:15,535
Right.

491
00:30:40,761 --> 00:30:41,628
Nice!

492
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:44,463
Dean!

493
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:51,170
Nice catch.

494
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:52,505
Right?

495
00:31:45,726 --> 00:31:46,993
That was amazing!

496
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:48,061
Right?

497
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,329
Right?

498
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,238
Man, i got to tell you,
i've never had so much
fun in my life.

499
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:00,807
Me neither.

500
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:03,342
It was a hell of a workout,
too, wasn't it?

501
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:06,345
We should keep
doing this.

502
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:07,546
I know.

503
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:08,815
I mean it.

504
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:10,783
There got to be
other ghosts out there.

505
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:12,418
We could help
a lot of people.

506
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:14,553
Yeah, right.
We'd be like the ghostfacers.

507
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:16,255
No, really.

508
00:32:16,323 --> 00:32:18,758
I mean... for real.

509
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:20,660
What?

510
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:22,595
Quit our jobs
and hit the road?

511
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:24,163
Exactly.

512
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:25,999
How would we live?

513
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,668
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.

514
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:31,004
How would we get by ... 
with stolen credit cards? Huh?

515
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:34,073
Eating diner food
drenched in saturated fats?

516
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:36,242
Sharing a crap motel room
every night?

517
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:38,511
That's all just details.
Details are everything!

518
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:41,280
You don't want to go
fighting ghosts without
any health insurance.

519
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:50,189
All right.
Uh... confession.

520
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:52,424
What?

521
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:56,729
Remember those dreams
i told you about,

522
00:32:56,797 --> 00:32:57,697
with the ghosts?

523
00:32:57,765 --> 00:32:59,231
Yeah.

524
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:00,432
I was fighting them.

525
00:33:01,635 --> 00:33:02,635
Okay.

526
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:04,370
With you.

527
00:33:04,437 --> 00:33:08,741
We were... 
these, like... 

528
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:09,809
hunters.

529
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:12,111
And we were friends.

530
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:16,348
More like brothers,
really.

531
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,454
I mean, what if
that's who we really are?

532
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:25,892
I mean, you saw us back there,
working together.

533
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,459
The ghost was
scrambling people's brains.

534
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:28,460
What if
it scrambled ours?

535
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:29,461
That's insane.

536
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:30,563
Is it?

537
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,598
Think about it
for just one second.

538
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,068
What if we think
this is our life... 

539
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:37,269
but it's not?

540
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:39,572
Hey, man, the ghost is dead,
and we're still standing.

541
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,140
I mean, i'm sorry,
but ... 

542
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,442
look, all i know is, this isn't
who we're supposed to be.

543
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,811
No.

544
00:33:44,878 --> 00:33:47,780
I'm dean smith, okay?
Director of sales and marketing.

545
00:33:47,848 --> 00:33:49,682
I went to stanford.

546
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,585
My father's name is bob,
my mother's name is ellen,
and my sister's name is jo.

547
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,053
When's the last time
you talked to them?

548
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:57,023
To any of them?

549
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:58,825
Okay. You're upset.
You're upset, you're confused ... 

550
00:33:58,892 --> 00:34:00,292
yeah,
'cause i only moved here

551
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,294
'cause i just broke up
with my fiancée, madison.

552
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:06,099
But i called her number and
i got a damn animal hospital.

553
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,167
Okay,
what are you saying?

554
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:10,870
You trying to say that ... 
that my family isn't real?

555
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:14,040
That we've been injected
with fake memories?

556
00:34:14,108 --> 00:34:15,374
Come on!

557
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:19,145
All i know is,
i got this feeling in my gut.

558
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:23,116
And i know ... 
i know that, deep down,

559
00:34:23,183 --> 00:34:26,052
you got to be
feeling it, too.

560
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,422
We're supposed to be
something else.

561
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,092
You're not just
some corporate douche bag.

562
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,326
This isn't you.

563
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:39,832
I know you.

564
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,402
Know me?

565
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,337
You don't know me, pal.

566
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:51,677
You should go.

567
00:36:08,578 --> 00:36:10,044
I quit.

568
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:23,258
Got a minute?

569
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:25,093
Sure. Of course.

570
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:28,196
How are you feeling,
dean?

571
00:36:28,264 --> 00:36:30,632
Uh... great.

572
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:32,767
You look
a little tired.

573
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:34,603
Been working hard,
i gather.

574
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,039
Ah, don't be modest.
I hear everything.

575
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:40,542
And i'm pleased
with what i'm hearing.

576
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:44,012
That's why it's important to me
that you're happy.

577
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,954
How's that
for a bonus?

578
00:36:57,993 --> 00:36:58,960
Very generous.

579
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:00,262
Purely selfish.

580
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:01,929
I want to make sure
you're not going anywhere.

581
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:05,200
Are you sure?

582
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:06,734
Positive.

583
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:08,236
You are
sandover material, son ... 

584
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,338
real go-getter,
carving your own way.

585
00:37:10,406 --> 00:37:11,673
Well, thanks.
I try.

586
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,408
I see big things
in your future.

587
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:14,643
Maybe even... 

588
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,547
senior v.p.,
eastern great lakes division.

589
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,449
Don't get me wrong.
You'll have to work for it ... 

590
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:23,918
seven days a week,
lunch at your desk ... 

591
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:28,089
but in 8 to 10 short years,
that could be you.

592
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,663
Uh, well, thank you.

593
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,030
Thank you, sir.

594
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:37,532
It's, um... 

595
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:41,736
but... 

596
00:37:41,804 --> 00:37:44,639
i am giving
my notice.

597
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,310
This is a joke.

598
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:50,212
You're kidding me,
right?

599
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:52,980
No, i... 

600
00:37:53,048 --> 00:37:55,250
i recently ... 
uh, very recently ... 

601
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:58,687
realized that i have
some other work i have to do.

602
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:01,122
It's, uh... 
very important to me.

603
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,458
Other work?
Another company?

604
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:05,493
No, i ... 
it's hard to explain.

605
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:07,462
Um... 

606
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,332
it's just
that this... 

607
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:12,634
this is,
it's just... 

608
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,205
... it's not
who i'm supposed to be.

609
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,144
What?

610
00:38:23,212 --> 00:38:26,281
Dean, dean, dean.

611
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:28,049
Finally.

612
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:34,256
What the hell?

613
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:36,190
Why am i wearing
a tie?

614
00:38:36,259 --> 00:38:37,225
My god, am i hungry.

615
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:40,428
Welcome back.

616
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:42,497
Wait. Did i ... 

617
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
did i just get
touched by ... 

618
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:47,402
you're an angel,
aren't you?

619
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,036
I'm zachariah.

620
00:38:49,104 --> 00:38:51,339
Oh, great. That's all i need,
is another one of you guys.

621
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:56,077
I'm hardly "another one," dean.
I'm castiel's superior.

622
00:38:56,145 --> 00:38:58,680
Believe me, i had no interest
in popping down here

623
00:38:58,748 --> 00:39:01,449
and into
one of these smelly things.

624
00:39:01,517 --> 00:39:05,186
But after the unfortunate... 
situation with uriel,

625
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:07,054
i felt it necessary
to pay a visit ... 

626
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:09,223
get my ducks in a row.

627
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:10,492
I am not
one of your ducks.

628
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,126
Starting
with your attitude.

629
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:17,265
Oh, so, what? This ...  this was
all some sort of a lesson?

630
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,167
Is that
what you're telling me?

631
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,803
Well, very creative.

632
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,870
You should see
my decoupage.

633
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:25,873
Gross.

634
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:27,842
No, thank you.

635
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,077
So, what, i'm ...  i'm just
hallucinating all this?

636
00:39:30,145 --> 00:39:31,313
Is that it?

637
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,448
Not at all.
Real place, real haunting.

638
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:35,249
Just plunked you
in the middle

639
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:37,251
without the benefit
of your memories.

640
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,954
Just to shake things up?
Hmm?

641
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:42,290
So you guys can have fun
watching us run around

642
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:44,225
like ass-clowns
in ...  in monkey suits?

643
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:46,894
To prove to you that
the path you're on is
truly in your blood.

644
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:47,995
You're a hunter.

645
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:49,664
Not because
your dad made you.

646
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:51,933
Not because
god called you back from hell.

647
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,336
But because
it is what you are.

648
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:55,737
And you love it.

649
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,739
You'll find your way to it
in the dark every single time,

650
00:39:57,807 --> 00:39:59,006
and you're miserable
without it.

651
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:01,810
Dean, let's be real here ... 
you're good at this.

652
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,845
You'll be successful.
You will stop it.

653
00:40:05,414 --> 00:40:07,415
Stop what?

654
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:09,617
The apocalypse, huh?
Lucifer?

655
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:11,453
What?
Be specific, man!

656
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,788
You'll do everything
you're destined to do.

657
00:40:13,856 --> 00:40:14,689
All of it.

658
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,760
But i know, i know.

659
00:40:18,828 --> 00:40:21,229
You're not strong enough.
You're scared.

660
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,765
You got daddy issues.
You can't do it, right?

661
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,967
Angel or not,
i will stab you in your face.

662
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,204
All i'm saying is... 

663
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:32,306
it's how
you look at it.

664
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,709
Most folks live and die
without moving anything more

665
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:36,611
than the dirt it takes
to bury them.

666
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,179
You get to
change things... 

667
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:40,181
save people.

668
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:42,450
Maybe even the world.

669
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:44,452
All the while,
you drive a classic car

670
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,920
and fornicate
with women.

671
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:49,791
This isn't a curse ... 
it's a gift.

672
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:53,160
So, for god's sakes, dean,
quit whining about it.

673
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:56,230
Look around.

674
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:00,802
There are plenty of fates
worse than yours.

675
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:08,743
So, you with me?

676
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:10,912
You want to go
steam yourself another latte?

677
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:14,883
Or are you ready
to stand up... 

678
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,186
... and be
who you really are?
