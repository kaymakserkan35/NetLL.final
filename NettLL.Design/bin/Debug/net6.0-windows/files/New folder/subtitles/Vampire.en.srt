1
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,860
The distant future....

2
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:15,840
Vampires rule the night, but their numbers are dwindling.

3
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:25,850
With huge bounties on their heads, a class of hunters has emerged, Bounty Hunters.

4
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,360
One hunter is unlike all the others. He is a Dunpeal; a half human half vampire.

5
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,910
At war with himself, feared by all, tortured and alone, he is...

6
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,510
Here he comes!

7
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,520
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. Blessed is the Lord Jesus Christ....

8
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,670
We've been expecting you

9
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,220
I'm Alan Elbourne, and I'm the one that summoned you here today for this reason.

10
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,830
Go on. I'm listening.

11
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,550
It's about my sister, Charlotte

12
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,200
Two nights ago she disappeared

13
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,080
She was in bed, sleeping; it was the middle of the night.

14
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,690
Several people told us they saw a carriage outside our house.

15
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,540
The carriage ...

16
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,850
... belonged to Meier Link, the vampire

17
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,590
I organized a search party of fifty men

18
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,440
but it was no use; we couldn't find them

19
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,410
We were ambushed.

20
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,180
... took my sister and killed my friends.

21
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,010
That's just a down payment.

22
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,840
You'll get the rest when you find her.

23
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,570
Ten million dollars.

24
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,020
But you better move fast

25
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,320
you've got some competition.

26
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,400
I've hired the Markus Brothers

27
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,890
and they've got a head start on you.

28
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,530
I don't think so.

29
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,610
Huh?

30
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,460
It may be too late for her

31
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,040
Your sister may already have been tempted.

32
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,810
What then?

33
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,650
You have to get there before that happens

34
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,070
what do you think we're paying you for?!

35
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,570
That's enough!

36
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,160
My son is emotional; please excuse him

37
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,990
This has been difficult for all of us.

38
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,870
If you knew my daughter, you'd understand

39
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,530
she's kind and beautiful

40
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,120
and her loss is more than this old soul can bear.

41
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,900
Now, I need to ask you something

42
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,120
if you find her changed, can you see that her death is without suffering.

43
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,680
Be kind to her, please.

44
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,740
No -- no!

45
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
We can't do that; it isn't right.

46
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,860
No! She won't be changed

47
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,630
you're talking about your daughter!

48
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,620
Alan, listen to me.

49
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,100
It's not easy to ask him for this

50
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,080
but it's something that must be done.

51
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,930
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,120
Do you understand?

53
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,410
I understand your position, but ...

54
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,800
... ten million dollars is not enough.

55
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,680
What?

56
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,120
How dare you!

57
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,860
Stop it

58
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,140
hold your fire!

59
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,580
I said stop!

60
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,810
I'll double the price.

61
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,080
I'll give you twenty million.

62
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,960
Just bring her back

63
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,310
one way or the other.

64
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,200
Did you see a carriage go by here with four horses in front?

65
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,210
Let me go

66
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,580
let me go

67
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,360
le

68
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,110
You're lying.

69
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,560
Oh, damn; we got company.

70
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,800
Lotsa company.

71
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,860
Look out!

72
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,500
Oh, man. Is everybody OK?

73
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,370
Yeah.

74
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,730
Do you believe that?

75
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,000
The place is overrun with them.

76
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,140
He musta been here already.

77
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,810
Well, c'mon

78
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,140
ready or not, here they come

79
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,100
It's zombie time.

80
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,110
Yeah, come and get it, zombies!

81
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,160
Amen to that.

82
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,210
Leila, are you there?

83
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,850
It won't take long, Grove.

84
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,800
Just...stay in the tank.

85
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,730
Can't load!

86
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,330
Not so fast, buddy.

87
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,170
And

88
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,610
fire!

89
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,940
Gotcha!

90
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,070
Rest in peace, huh?

91
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,080
You hear that?

92
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,400
Sounds like a horse.

93
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,100
It's moving...uphill

94
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,460
Let me try.

95
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,680
Right ...

96
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,890
right about ...

97
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,840
right there!

98
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,300
Beautiful, just beautiful.

99
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,090
I applaud you, stranger.

100
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,830
Tell me what you're doing here.

101
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,940
If we're in the same game, we should be friends.

102
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,040
Tell me your name.

103
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,200
Mine's Borgoff, Borgoff Markus.

104
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,200
D.

105
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,200
Ah, so that's the guy, the dhampir hunter.

106
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,270
I've heard about him.

107
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,200
He's amazing.

108
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,500
Wake up, Borgoff, he's the competition, not some buddy of ours.

109
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,480
C'mon, what are we doing here, we just helped him, think about it.

110
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,910
Yeah, he's right, I agree with him about that.

111
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,440
We help him too much and he'll take all the money.

112
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,970
If it wasn't for us, he'd be dead by now.

113
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,970
We do the work and he gets the reward.

114
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,180
Ah, you boys should relax.

115
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,570
We just did the famous dhampir a little favor is all.

116
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,550
A little favor we can't afford.

117
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,000
Hey

118
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,470
y'ever hear the one about the owl and squirrel?

119
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,210
Squirrel works all summer storin' away stuff for the winter, all kinds of nuts and seeds

120
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,570
works real hard.

121
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,010
Then one day just before the first snow he goes outside for one last look around when

122
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,220
all of a sudden this owl swoops down and

123
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,760
grabs him, carries him off.

124
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,780
"Ah, what a shame," says the squirrel

125
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,450
"'cause what's gonna happen to all that good food?"

126
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,690
Aw, that's a good one.

127
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,450
Yeah, hilarious.

128
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,300
You get it, you guys?

129
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,300
That stupid squirrel is all I can

130
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,850
Leila!

131
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,570
Hey, Leila, what's the rush?

132
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,370
What's with her?

133
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,650
So you're outnumbered, four to one; so what?

134
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,130
They do have a head start, but when the sun comes up, the heat will slow 'em down.

135
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,330
Speaking of, ah, sun and heat, I know I don't need to remind you of your susceptibility.

136
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,330
It's called heat syndrome...

137
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,050
and the last time you ignored it, you almost

138
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,090
Don't worry.

139
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,650
I hate it when you say that.

140
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,610
What...what are those ?

141
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,650
Tracks

142
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,930
let me see

143
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,930
Yes, OK! these are definitely that tracks, six hours old I'd say

144
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,970
OK.

145
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,240
I'm suffocating now.

146
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,060
Hey, how was that?

147
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,300
That's funny

148
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
I could have sworn I heard something.

149
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,100
Quiet.

150
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,540
Sand mantas, most likely.

151
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,890
Sweet blasphemy, sand mantas galore!

152
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,410
Talk about your prehistoric pigeons.

153
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,770
They're filthy animals, y'know, they're just filthy!

154
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,700
Well, I--I guess we better just turn back

155
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,140
it's a shame, really, 'cause you know, we could

156
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,850
No -- go back, man

157
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,610
go back, now, c'mon

158
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,050
you're crazy

159
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,530
c'mon, man -- please, let's' just go back

160
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,650
That -- that was good

161
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,650
OK, now, we survived that, could we stop?

162
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,210
Did...did you ever hear the expression "too close for comfort"?

163
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,970
That--that was damn uncomfortable.

164
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,290
What is it ? a resting house?

165
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,870
I didn't think anybody had those any more.

166
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,130
They must be in there.

167
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,610
Wow, it blends in nicely.

168
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,660
OK...oh, here we are.

169
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,500
I -- I see 'em.

170
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,740
How many are there?

171
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,740
Two...I think.

172
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,660
A man ... and a woman.

173
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,100
Look out for the exit door.

174
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,100
No door ...

175
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,140
no door there ...

176
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,420
still no door...

177
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,940
no ...

178
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,130
Are you sure ... about that door ...?

179
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,650
No ... no ...

180
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:53,890
What was that?

181
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,410
She's out of her mind!

182
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,850
Door! DOOR!

183
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,530
You're dead!

184
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,510
I'm here for the young woman.

185
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,300
I wouldn't recommend it, dhampir.

186
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,470
Taking on a vampire at night is a mission for morons and fools.

187
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,400
which are you?

188
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,640
She's here by her own choice, dhampir.

189
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,600
So unless you're the kind of man who would take a woman against her will for the money in it

190
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,480
and I'm sure it's a lot

191
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,280
I suggest you save your sorry ass now and leave us to travel in peace.

192
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,240
I would if I could believe you, Meier.

193
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,400
Your credibility, however, is less than impeccable under the circumstances.

194
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
You kidnapped the girl.

195
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,940
Meier!

196
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,740
Oh, my nose, my nose!

197
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,580
What happened ?

198
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,780
what'd...what'd I miss?

199
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,140
She called out his name.

200
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,020
It may be true, what he said.

201
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,660
No, she's just ignorant

202
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,860
she's a child.

203
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,060
She doesn't know him yet.

204
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
She doesn't know what he's capable of.

205
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,520
That poor girl

206
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
she's...she's bleeding pretty bad.

207
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,970
I mean, she won't last long.

208
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,230
It's a shame

209
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,070
really -- to waste all that good blood

210
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,950
I mean -- come on, admit it -- you're tempted.

211
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,710
I mean, I know you are!

212
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,910
M...Mother...

213
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,610
Wait, I was just kidding, y'know.

214
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,330
C'mon, let's go.

215
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,530
We got work to do...

216
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,190
...The money, c'mon; think of the money!

217
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,590
Hey, what did you do to me?

218
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,130
I bound your wound and stopped your bleeding. That's all.

219
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,590
Oh, I get it.

220
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,260
You think you can just go ahead and tear off the clothes of whoever you come across.

221
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,600
That's what you think, isn't it, DHAMPIR.

222
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,240
You should go back home and nurse your wounds.

223
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
What are you, my mother?

224
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,680
You called out for your mother before

225
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,100
I thought you might be needing her.

226
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,980
Hey

227
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,540
I see her.

228
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,390
When the last vampire is extinct, who will mourn our passing?

229
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,650
Will she? will anyone?

230
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,160
Can anyone understand this pain, this loneliness?

231
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,520
I told you so, didn't I?

232
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,020
I said, leave the girl alone

233
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,040
she's trouble

234
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,300
she's competition, y'know.

235
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,740
YOU aided and abetted the enemy.

236
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,720
I hope this is the right way.

237
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,260
Trust me, I know how they think, these vampires:

238
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,560
when they're threatened, they all head for Barbarois.

239
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,060
They're so predictable.

240
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
Barbarois, yeah

241
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
And I really hate that place.

242
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,200
It's full of lunatics and monsters, and that old crazy man, y'know.

243
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,300
Does it hurt very much, Leila?

244
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,240
Leila?

245
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,480
Huh?

246
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,880
Your injury...does it hurt you?

247
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,720
Oh, no, it's fine.

248
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,320
I...

249
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,020
Grove, you should lie down, you look tired.

250
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,920
You need to rest...don't worry about me.

251
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,700
Leila...

252
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,120
who dressed the wound? Was it him?

253
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,250
You can tell me.

254
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,710
It was him, wasn't it? The dhampir hunter.

255
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,890
Leila, I'm warning you

256
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,390
he...he's trouble. He's against us.

257
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,950
I don't know why he did that.

258
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,790
Grove, please don't tell anyone, OK?

259
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,780
He stopped there

260
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,420
but what for?

261
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,300
Let's find out.

262
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,360
Nolt and Kyle, you come with me

263
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,300
Leila, you stay in here with Grove.

264
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,220
OK...is everybody ready?

265
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,880
Always.

266
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,280
Ready.

267
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,780
Yeah.

268
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,150
Hey, Nolt,  see what's goin' on in there, willya?

269
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,530
It may be a trap.

270
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,350
Yeah, we'll cover you.

271
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,490
It'll be my pleasure, gentlemen

272
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,350
It's nothin' but a lousy piece of cloth.

273
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,110
What the hell ?

274
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,350
Bastard...unbelievable!

275
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,730
Hey...watch out!

276
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,640
So...

277
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,120
you dare to enter Barbarois

278
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:16,050
I assume it's arrogance and vast stupidity that brings you here, gentlemen

279
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,310
or perhaps it's ignorance.

280
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,350
You're skillful hunters, I can see

281
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,870
but you're no match for the Barbarois.

282
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,950
Five thousand years of isolation have made us invincible!

283
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,150
Huh?

284
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,180
What?

285
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,960
What the hell's going on?

286
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,730
The shadow...

287
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,250
...watch out for the shadow.

288
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,670
What're you talking about?

289
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,460
The shadow...whaddayou mean?

290
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,320
Hey...Nolt?

291
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,230
Hey, Nolt, what the hell happened to you, huh?

292
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,090
He's...He's dead!

293
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,290
No, he's not!

294
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,610
Come on, Nolt...

295
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,830
...come on, snap out of it, come on...

296
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,230
oh my God, damn it, come on!

297
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,350
I need you!

298
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,140
Oh God...Nolt !

299
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,580
Oh, God...we're getting close.

300
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,220
Those...are the windmills of the Barbarois.

301
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,100
I really wish you'd turn back.

302
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,780
There must be another way.

303
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,360
There isn't.

304
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,150
I am D, the hunter

305
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,410
I have business with the Barbarois.

306
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,910
Oh, no.....

307
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,740
So I see you have dismounted.

308
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,420
You have respect for your elders.

309
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,440
That's very considerate indeed.

310
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,660
I want you to stop your protection of Meier Link.

311
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,320
You what?

312
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,780
You know, you make me laugh, that's a good one.

313
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,940
I see you are a very humorous young man, and beautiful too, I might add.

314
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,720
Or does that make you uncomfortable, to have an old lech like me admire you so?

315
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,640
Do you take me for a fool?

316
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,160
Someone paid me a hundred million dollars to protect Meier Link.

317
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,100
Can you top that?

318
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,310
Well, you drive a hard bargain there, old man

319
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,930
what if I can?

320
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,050
You really are entertaining me, Mr. Stranger!

321
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,630
I suppose you know our reputation

322
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,730
the Barbarois serve the people of the night,

323
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,890
and after five thousand years, I don't think we're about to change our stripes anytime soon,

324
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,330
although if we did for anyone it would be for you.

325
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,670
I have seen many a dhampir,

326
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,400
but somebody like you I've never seen before.

327
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,280
That's why it's such a pity that you have to die.

328
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,580
I really can't let you leave here alive, now, can I?

329
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm afraid you have to die, Stranger.

330
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,540
So sorry.

331
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,710
The Barbarois are great warriors.

332
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,470
You are a warrior too, no doubt

333
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,070
and although you may kill some of us,

334
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,580
in the end we will prevail.

335
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,290
I have sworn to protect the carriage

336
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,790
prepare to die!

337
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:45,810
Fool!

338
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,810
What's he doin' in there?

339
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,910
Borgoff, are we ready yet?

340
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,960
Grove

341
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,120
we have no choice.

342
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,700
We need your help on this, Grove.

343
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,480
Think you can do it there, man?

344
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,420
Give it to me

345
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,540
I'm waiting.

346
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,820
Don't push yourself too hard, now.

347
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,900
I mean it, OK

348
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,060
I want you back.

349
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,920
You know, I really have nothing against the Barbarois personally.

350
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,380
It's a shame I'll have to kill so many of you.

351
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,300
Indeed, I admire your loyalty and your devotion to duty.

352
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,860
Yet I wonder about the fairness when you allow one to fight against so many.

353
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,700
But...

354
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,360
if that will entertain you...

355
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,240
I see.

356
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,340
you make I see. a good argument, young man

357
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,480
how interesting.

358
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,360
Oh, man, I think the fellow is right.

359
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,360
Please allow the three of us to entertain our young guest here,

360
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,080
unless he thinks that's unfair

361
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,660
three against one, how unfair, three against one, unfair...

362
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,280
That's enough!

363
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,880
You mock us with your ridiculous antics, Benge.

364
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:09,050
I will not have you distracting us from the job at hand, which is the protection of the carriage.

365
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,430
We'll do things my way...huh?

366
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,810
What the devil is that?

367
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,930
Go for it, Grove...go for it!

368
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,980
Kill all those guys

369
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,180
kill every last one of 'em!

370
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,380
Come on, Grove, hold on.

371
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,210
Get the carriage out now!

372
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,050
Follow me, Tinkerbell.

373
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,070
I'm waiting for you!

374
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,180
Grove!

375
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,010
I've got to say this

376
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,610
I admire that young hunter's spirit,

377
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,870
although he doesn't stand a chance against Benge and the others.

378
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,950
Still, it's a pity I'll miss the show.

379
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,570
Oh well, c'est la vie.

380
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,500
Wake up, D!

381
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,020
What's wrong with you?

382
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,570
It's not fair, it's not fair

383
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,210
I'll show you what's not fair!

384
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,970
Stay there till you rot, hunter!

385
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,740
Suckers!

386
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,800
Stop, I beg you.

387
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,300
Say goodnight.

388
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,120
Kyle, did you happen to see where that girl went?

389
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,960
Maybe she got caught in the wheels.

390
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,060
Go look.

391
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,720
Nice, Caroline, very nice.

392
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,520
A little crude, but effective.

393
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
They're all yours!

394
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,220
That freakin' monster.

395
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,380
Is everybody all right?

396
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,200
Yeah, but Kyle was outside.

397
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,140
He was up on top.

398
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,050
Kyle?

399
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,370
Kyle, where the hell are you, Kyle?

400
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,370
Down here!

401
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:22,710
You OK?

402
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,570
Quiet! They're still around!

403
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,040
No!

404
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,720
Damn! That idiot!

405
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,900
Well, how convenient this is for me.

406
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,460
Come on out here so I can finish the job.

407
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,460
Your time is up.

408
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,080
Come on, you coward!

409
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,560
You're gonna pay for the pain you caused my brother.

410
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,210
D! Are you awake?

411
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,730
I need your help to swallow up this spell.

412
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,390
You're a slave driver, you know that?

413
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,090
Hey, remember to watch out for the shadow, huh?

414
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,610
Try and stay still.

415
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,470
Easier said than done.

416
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,910
And keep your mouth shut.

417
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,300
That was close...

418
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,000
Well, the tank is fulla holes.

419
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,940
Fuel's all gone, we can't drive it like this anyway.

420
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,020
What're we gonna do?

421
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,940
What. Should. We. Do?

422
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,940
Borgoff, any idea?

423
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,280
How's Grove?

424
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,460
Honestly, not too great.

425
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,780
Borgoff, wake up!

426
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,280
What are you thinking about over there?

427
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,600
Oh, nothin', really.

428
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,420
I was just thinkin' about the carriage.

429
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,060
Wonder where it is by now.

430
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,060
Well, man, at this point it's pretty much anybody's guess.

431
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:07,560
If you want my opinion, I'd say they're either setting sail from the port of Abrol or hiding somewhere deep in the Grenerge Mountain Range.

432
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,560
I sure hope so.

433
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,960
Anyway, we still have to get some fuel

434
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,130
and the town of Garucia isn't that far away from here.

435
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,250
Kyle, you go with Leila.

436
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,730
I'll stay here and do the repairs.

437
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,270
If you are seeking the pathway to the stars, come to me.

438
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,330
I pray for your safe arrival with all my heart.

439
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,300
The pathway to the stars....

440
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,390
I dunno about you, but y'know, I sure miss that horse.

441
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,230
What was his name?

442
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,170
Oh...oh, the silent treatment, huh?

443
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,750
Well, I got two words for you: Heat syndrome.

444
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:22,130
Look -- look, I know I'm a parasite, but haven't I always been a helpful parasite?

445
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,030
You may not care if you die from heat

446
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,350
but becoming a piece of beef jerky is not a lifelong ambition of mine.

447
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,040
Yeah, well, what's the sound of one hand yapping...

448
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,860
How much?

449
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,540
Oh no -- keep your money.

450
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,420
C'mon, just take it --

451
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,840
Let's go.

452
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,120
Leila?

453
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,280
Oh. I see.

454
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,540
It's him, isn't it?

455
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,030
Kyle, why don't you start back without me.

456
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,150
There's something I want to do here first.

457
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,890
Back off.

458
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,480
Have I told you

459
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,370
you're quite irresistible in that sexy skin-tight getup?

460
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,610
No -- tell me about it.

461
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,530
I just did.

462
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,790
Make sure you watch your back with that guy, Leila.

463
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:38,940
I'd like a beer.

464
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,470
I've just been admirin' your fancy weapon there.

465
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,070
Don't worry.

466
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,490
I have no plans to use it anytime soon.

467
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,870
That's good.

468
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:05,770
That's good, 'cause I have no plans to let you keep it.

469
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,510
Give it up.

470
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,920
You heard me, little girl.

471
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,290
Mm. Thank you.

472
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,830
Well, here's to ya, Sheriff.

473
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,650
I'd buy you a drink, but...

474
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,540
Thank you, but no thanks.

475
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:36,510
Oh, OK. I was just gonna say, you must be awfully busy with that new dhampir hunter in the town now.

476
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,810
What dhampir hunter?

477
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,220
I'd like to buy that horse.

478
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,510
Three hundred thousand dollars.

479
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,380
And if you don't like the price, go somewhere else.

480
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,950
Freeze! Put your hands where I can see 'em. Now!

481
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,680
Sheriff, he paid good money for that.

482
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,260
What are you doing?!

483
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,090
Take your money and go.

484
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,520
We don't want you here.

485
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,090
We don't sell to dhampirs in this town, understand?

486
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,530
Understand me, dhampir?

487
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,280
You understand.

488
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,570
Wait a minute. That's my horse you're talking about there,

489
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,580
and I'll sell it to whoever I want if they can afford the price I'm asking.

490
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,470
You can't do that.

491
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,250
We have laws against it, Polk...good laws, and for a damn good reason.

492
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,660
What laws?

493
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,810
Don't play coy, Polk, you know as well as I dhampirs aren't allowed.

494
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,890
Not allowed, right ...

495
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:13,430
I remember a time not that long ago when we had vampires and dhampirs both around here. But...

496
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,830
And that's why we have the law.

497
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,770
Listen to me, whether you want to hear it or not...you weren't even born when this happened.

498
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,230
Do yourself a favor and listen to the story.

499
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,160
I'm going to tell you about the time when the children were kidnapped.

500
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,540
There were ten children altogether ...

501
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,760
Yeah, I heard about that time.

502
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,740
The kidnappers turned out to be vampires, of course.

503
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,230
And so the townspeople pooled their money to hire a vampire hunter.

504
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,840
They wanted the best.

505
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,390
And when the hunter came...

506
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,750
he was a very strong and quiet man.

507
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:51,710
and he did his job, too, which was to return the children safely back into their parents' homes.

508
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,610
It wasn't easy, but many vampires died by his hands before this job was over with.

509
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,700
And when it was over and the children were back home,

510
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,400
the people attacked the man.

511
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:06,960
They said he was a dhampir, half vampire himself...so they punished him.

512
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,130
Can't say I blame them for doing that.

513
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,570
You can't trust 'em, that's all that's about.

514
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,570
They were right about that part, Polk.

515
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,290
He did the job!

516
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,440
I see then, I'll have to take matters into my own hands.

517
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,820
Let him go.

518
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,970
What is that?

519
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,280
What does it look like, idiot?

520
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,310
Put down your guns.

521
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,490
Polk, you can't know what you're doing ... put it down...

522
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,490
I know exactly what I'm doing.

523
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,870
You DON'T know! Put it down now, you old fool!

524
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,510
I would much rather be an old fool than what you are, Sheriff.

525
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,430
Now, don't shoot.

526
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,840
I can tell you I won't think twice about using this weapon.

527
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,850
I might even enjoy it.

528
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,730
Get on your horse, Stranger.

529
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,880
Thank you.

530
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,850
No, it's only fitting I thank you.

531
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,600
It's the least I can do.

532
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:10,200
I may be just an old fool now, Stranger,  but I could never forget a face like yours.

533
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,160
And I'll never forget what you done for me back then.

534
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,230
That's right...I was one of them kids.

535
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,310
And I always felt bad about that

536
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,450
the way you was treated.

537
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:32,640
How nobody stopped you, nobody thanked you instead the ignorant bastards ran you right out of our town.

538
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,510
So it's true, isn't it, what they say about you dhampirs.

539
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,520
You don't age.

540
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,140
Now go...I'm getting tired.

541
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,590
Where's Benge? What's taking him so long?

542
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,120
Well, the horses are rested now. We'd better go.

543
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:09,620
Come on.

544
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,010
Master, what is it? May I help you, sir?

545
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,320
It's still light outside, Master!

546
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,200
What...?

547
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,700
Leave her alone, Mashira.

548
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,130
Yes, sir.

549
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,370
She misses the sunlight. Let her enjoy it.

550
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,290
I am D, the hunter.

551
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,230
Your father sent me.

552
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,600
Don't be afraid...I won't hurt you.

553
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:28,540
You sit in the sunlight...you must not be changed.

554
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,550
So why do you stay with him?

555
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,830
Last night in the carriage you called out his name.

556
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,370
Why did you call for him?

557
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,690
I suppose my father has not told you that I'm in love with Meier.

558
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,050
You don't know who he is.

559
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,050
You can't be in love with him.

560
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,090
Well, I am.

561
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,240
If you only knew how good he's been to me.

562
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,240
I love him.

563
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,500
Please believe me; no one else will.

564
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,500
You don't understand.

565
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,720
He is what he is, Charlotte.

566
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,760
You can't change him; he'll take you in time.

567
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,700
And when that happens, I will have to kill you.

568
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,820
Fine; kill me, then.

569
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,860
I would rather die than to go anywhere without him.

570
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:21,340
Don't take me back there...I mean it. I simply could not live without Meier.

571
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,590
How sweet that is.

572
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:27,180
She loves a vampire.

573
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,390
So very sweet.

574
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,730
Idiot!

575
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,520
You stupid girl, get up! We're going.

576
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:37,890
Leave me alone!

577
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,420
You'll do what I say.

578
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:46,570
Do you have any idea how many people have died at the hands of your beloved Meier, this vampire you wanna protect!

579
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,570
None!

580
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:52,550
You fool! And you...You stay right where you are, my friend.

581
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,520
Sorry, but I really don't want to have to share any of my profits.

582
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,060
You understand, don't you...it's business.

583
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,000
Above you.

584
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,430
What's wrong? Tell me!

585
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,320
Too much sun.

586
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,070
I warned you about the heat, but you don't listen!

587
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:15,550
Come on. You can't survive unless you dig a hole. You need to bury yourself!

588
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,380
Hurry!

589
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,340
Leila! Leila, are you there? Come in, Leila.

590
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:42,840
Yeah, I copy.

591
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,980
Thank God. Are you OK? What's your position?

592
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,770
I'm near Lake Chiffon. Our game is heading north from here.

593
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:51,180
We'll catch up.

594
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,420
Leila, do you know what's happened to the dhampir hunter?

595
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,270
No; I haven't seen him.

596
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,020
All right. Well, take care.

597
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,130
Stay in touch. Borgoff out.

598
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,700
The tables have turned.

599
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,030
Now, that cleared my head.

600
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:56,020
I really should return the favor, don't you think, honey?

601
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,400
Don't get any ideas.

602
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,410
Hey, I'm just trying to stay dry here.

603
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,370
If there was any other place to go, believe me, I'd be there.

604
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,280
As soon as the rain lets up, I'll be gone from here and from you.

605
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,060
I think I can guess your problem.

606
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,510
Your family was the victim of vampires.

607
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,520
You don't know what you're talking about.

608
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,180
You don't know anything about it.

609
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,600
All right. Perhaps I don't.

610
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,940
This stupid thing...it bothers me.

611
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,670
You really are a weird one, you know that?

612
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:38,020
In spite of being a dhampir hunter and all that that entails.

613
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:40,770
How did you know about my mother?

614
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,040
You called her name, remember?

615
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,880
She was kidnapped by vampires.

616
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:50,480
My father went after her and was trying to rescue her ... so they killed him.

617
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:55,230
And after a while my mother returned, but she wasn't my mother any more

618
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,790
she'd been changed.

619
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,400
The people in the village stoned her to death while I watched.

620
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,050
After that I left home.

621
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:04,710
I met the Markus brothers and joined with them.

622
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,090
I wanted to be a hunter to avenge my parents' deaths.

623
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:14,310
I've seen many terrible things since then, lives destroyed, families devastated, hopes crushed...

624
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,630
every time, it seems ... vampire is to blame.

625
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,090
I can understand why you'd choose to do it, but the life of a hunter is no kind of life.

626
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:29,290
It's the only life I'm any good for now, and it looks like it's the only life you've ever known.

627
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,830
So I suggest we make a pact.

628
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:38,830
Since we're both in it for the long haul, whoever dies first, the other one can come and bring flowers to their grave.

629
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,480
How's that?

630
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:41,900
It's the rain

631
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,170
makes me sentimental.

632
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,730
I don't know why I should care about that...it's just I love flowers.

633
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,740
And I don't think I'll be getting any...

634
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,500
I'm all alone, after all.

635
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,100
We have that much in common, don't we.

636
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,100
That we're both hunters and we're both alone.

637
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,500
Oh well, I'm being silly...doesn't really matter

638
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,150
I'll do it.

639
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,860
I'll bring you flowers if I survive this...but I don't expect to.

640
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,370
Stop, I didn't really mean it when I said that.

641
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,320
And anyway, I don't really understand why you should keep on doing this.

642
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,560
Because I'm a dhampir.

643
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,090
I don't get to have a life; not like you.

644
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,310
Well, with the rainstorm last night, they can't be too far away.

645
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,560
We're even now, dhampir...understand?

646
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:15,850
I have a very bad feeling about this.

647
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,020
How so?

648
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:20,350
I think I've finally figured it out, Borgoff.

649
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:26,140
Well, I'm sure you're right...if you're thinking they're headed for the castle.

650
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,100
Yeah, that's right, the castle...the Castle of Chaythe!

651
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:34,950
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, WE CAN'T GO IN THERE, IT WOULD BE SUICIDE!

652
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,700
What are you now, afraid of a little insanity?

653
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,220
Since when have we been sane?

654
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,180
We just have to get to them before they reach the castle.

655
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,930
There's a bridge up ahead...that's where we intercept the carriage.

656
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:52,160
I remember that trick from the time we got those vampires at Keldo.

657
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,490
Yeah, it worked that time, and it can work again now.

658
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,570
Leila, come in; come in, Leila. Over.

659
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,170
Yeah it's me, I copy.

660
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,440
What's up?

661
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,090
I'm on my way.

662
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,440
Don't move.

663
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:42,820
I'm warning you...try anything funny and you'll be blown to smithereens.

664
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,310
You wanna try it?

665
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,570
I didn't think so.

666
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,020
We just want the girl.

667
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:00,880
Hello there!

668
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,930
She's still human!

669
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,330
Come on, get out of there. NOW!

670
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:09,870
Borgoff, she won't come.

671
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,830
We're doing you a favor!

672
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,390
Come ON, I said get outta there!

673
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,980
Let that be a lesson to ya, you cowardly Barbarois animal.

674
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,090
Borgoff, look.

675
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,360
Borgoff!

676
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,130
What? What the --?

677
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,340
What, is this guy crazy?

678
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,420
Doesn't he know he can't exist outside here in the sunlight?

679
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,940
I won't let you take her!

680
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,170
Oh, yeah?

681
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,360
Thanks a lot...you're making our job a lot easier.

682
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:08,720
Hot enough for ya?

683
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,200
What you deserve!

684
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,360
Over here, hot stuff!

685
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,510
Oohoo, lookit him burn!

686
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:33,740
No!

687
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,020
What the hell do you want...

688
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,430
How's that feel...moron...!

689
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,500
lookit him!

690
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:47,750
Hey, where do you think...!

691
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,860
Why'd you let her go!

692
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,660
I love you.

693
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,630
I can't go on without you.

694
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:28,730
What?

695
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,300
Borgoff, we should just let her kill herself

696
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,550
and then we can finish him off, what do you think about that idea?

697
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,190
We get the money if she's dead or alive.

698
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,080
Hey, you're right...OK.

699
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:52,670
Stop it!

700
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,940
Kyle!

701
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,150
I'll blow you to hell!

702
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,440
What!

703
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:39,060
I don't want you to worry about these wounds of mine.

704
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,650
They will heal.

705
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:44,770
Then we shall go to the city of night and distant stars.

706
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,530
When we go there we can be alone and free to love each other.

707
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:56,540
It's true, believe me; we'll be there soon.

708
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:47,200
We're it now; we're the only ones left, Borgoff; we should just give it up.

709
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:54,070
If we make it into that castle, none of us will make it out alive.

710
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,840
We CAN'T quit now.

711
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,950
We owe it to Kyle and to Nolt to keep going on.

712
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:03,980
Listen, Borgoff...

713
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,660
Shaddup! I won't hear it.

714
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,550
Leila...what do you think?

715
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:15,140
Grove, they fear us.

716
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:19,820
They fear us because they know our reputation. That we never give up.

717
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:21,460
And we never can.

718
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,730
If we quit now, we might as well quit the business, and I can't do that.

719
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,270
I won't do it...till every last one of them is gone.

720
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:52,100
Master...do you hear?

721
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,240
He is coming.

722
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,340
The castle is nearby.

723
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,860
I'll stay here and deal with him.

724
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,380
Getting close. The Castle of Chaythe.

725
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,260
Soon we'll be able to see it

726
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,040
the home of Carmila, the Bloody Countess.

727
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:33,690
You've heard of her.

728
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:38,570
For five thousand years her rule of terror lasted, and then, that was that!

729
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,190
Your father, the vampire king, grew angry.

730
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:52,590
He was impatient with her vanity; offended by her bloodlust, her gluttony.

731
01:05:52,960 --> 01:06:00,020
He grew so tired that he killed her while she slept, impaling her on a sword, and that was it for her.

732
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:06,890
Except she haunts the place now with phantoms and demons, but you don't care about that, do you?

733
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:10,100
But I bet I know what really gets to you, dhampir

734
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,850
what REALLY gets to you

735
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:17,740
the thought of those two lovebirds giving birth to another dhampir, huh?

736
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:18,520
That's it.

737
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:26,920
You see, I know you; I know how you think, I know how you feel, I know every move that you make, you can't...

738
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,850
I'm glad we could meet at last, Hunter D.

739
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,610
You are a worthy opponent.

740
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:46,510
Who hired the Barbarois?

741
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:48,530
Who were you working for?

742
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,050
It was Carmila who hired us.

743
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,640
And as a Barbarois, my duty has been fulfilled.

744
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,270
Now I can die in peace.

745
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:09,170
I gather from your letter that you had a rather difficult time.

746
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,310
I think I can understand what it's like.

747
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,690
Love is not unique to humans, you know

748
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:16,070
we vampires are very susceptible.

749
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,070
I hope I can be of service.

750
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,320
We're very grateful, Carmila.

751
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,980
You both must be exhausted.

752
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:28,750
Perhaps you should rest first.

753
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:31,340
I'm sure that the young lady would like to freshen up.

754
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:46,690
You've probably heard rumors about me, but I can assure you, they all stem from jealousy and envy.

755
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:49,810
I'm not the "Bloody Carmila" they like to portray me as.

756
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,070
Now, behold...

757
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,310
That's it; that is the ship.

758
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:09,180
It will take you to the city of the night where you can live peacefully at last.

759
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,520
You can be happy there.

760
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:20,910
There was a time, many years ago, when every castle had a ship like this one and the night sky was full of their flashing lights.

761
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:27,940
Those were the days when vampires flourished and a love like yours was not so desperately impossible.

762
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,770
So different from today.

763
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:37,100
Our numbers dwindling, hunted and alone, we're hopelessly misunderstood

764
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:42,510
but you two seem to have beaten the odds.

765
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,780
I'm very very happy for you.

766
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,810
The ship hasn't been used in years.

767
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:57,660
I've no idea if it will fly safely, but I'm sure that's a risk you're prepared to take.

768
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,290
We're very grateful.

769
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:04,290
I only wish I could go with you.

770
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,180
You look so beautiful.

771
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:48,710
Why stop? I want you, Meier. I want all of you.

772
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,100
Why not?

773
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:57,340
You don't know what it's like, Charlotte

774
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:05,960
to live forever in darkness eternal, forever thirsting for blood despite your best intention.

775
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:10,190
I can't imagine that life for you; not for you, Charlotte.

776
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,080
You're so selfish, Meier.

777
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,460
I carry a heavy weight on my conscience.

778
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,220
Those villagers and the bounty hunter and my family...they still mourn my loss, Meier.

779
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,970
It wasn't your doing, Charlotte.

780
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,480
It was my fault entirely.

781
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,900
Well, then we're both to blame, because we can't know happiness; not anymore.

782
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:40,140
I wanted you to be happy, Meier, and so I abandoned my father and my brother for you.

783
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,280
But their pain set the wheels in motion for our pain, and so on and on it goes.

784
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,600
All we have is each other now, and I want to be close to you.

785
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,270
Without that we have nothing.

786
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:02,720
All the pain I've caused and all the agony I feel is nothing now!

787
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:05,390
And you are everything to me, my love.

788
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:19,420
We'll talk more on our trip to the stars, if that's all right with you.

789
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:26,850
There is some unfinished business I have to attend to.

790
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,430
Do not leave this room, understand?

791
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,030
D.

792
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:25,600
Listen, Meier. The woman says she wants to go back home.

793
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,880
I don't ... believe it.

794
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,890
Charlotte....

795
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,620
I dunno, something's not right.

796
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,080
'Course, ah, you don't have to take my word for it

797
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,690
you can judge for yourself.

798
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,340
Let's go!

799
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,230
Leila, don't go.

800
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,390
Leila, don't go in there.

801
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,350
If you go in there, you're never coming back!

802
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,490
Oh, I'm coming back.

803
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,200
No!

804
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,500
Leila, check upstairs.

805
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:33,610
I'm on it.

806
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,580
Nice hat.

807
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,340
I know you hate me, D.

808
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,130
Please try and understand.

809
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:35,390
I loved your father.

810
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,650
What choice did I have?

811
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,500
Nolt, Kyle

812
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,870
hey, I don't believe it!

813
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,950
You two sure are a sight for sore eyes!

814
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,580
What are you doing? Get up!

815
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,240
Why aren't you listening...I said get up!

816
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,680
Go away.

817
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,410
Get out of here!

818
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:05,650
Can you forgive me, D?

819
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:07,780
D?

820
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,900
I know it's been lonely for you.

821
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:13,820
I was lonely too

822
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,200
until you came along.

823
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,790
Did you hear? D?

824
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,610
It's OK, honey

825
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,490
it's OK to cry.

826
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:35,080
I know ... I know how you feel.

827
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:39,510
It wasn't your fault. It wasn't.

828
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:41,980
Yes it was!

829
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,950
Let go!

830
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,750
It's just an illusion.

831
01:18:57,610 --> 01:18:58,920
Carmila's playing with us.

832
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,850
Excellent...what fun!

833
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:07,550
I haven't had this much fun in centuries!

834
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,190
You don't mind, do you?

835
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,020
It just makes things so much more interesting.

836
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:15,970
You're doing very well, by the way very well indeed.

837
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,210
The woman...where are you hiding her?

838
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,900
Borgoff...what are you doing! We don't have time for this!

839
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,180
Leila -- are you in love with this dhampir?

840
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:39,400
Are you crazy? What is wrong with you

841
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:42,320
Borgoff!

842
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,540
Dhampir

843
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,550
drop your weapon.

844
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:03,900
Drop it now!

845
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:06,200
She took you in, didn't she?

846
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:13,670
She'll die! I'm warning you, dhampir, don't come any closer.

847
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:18,890
Enough! Now you die

848
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,030
Grove!

849
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,450
Grove, no!

850
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,860
Lei ... la ...

851
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:43,770
Look...she's coming...Carmila.

852
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,790
The spirit of Carmila!

853
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:34,010
Dhampir hunter...your mother was human, but your father was a vampire, and you're betraying his ancient blood.

854
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,080
You side with humans against us.

855
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:45,170
Your people are facing extinction, and you're contributing to their demise.

856
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:49,520
You stalk and kill your own ancestors, dhampir

857
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:55,150
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!

858
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,800
Your human self is your weaker self.

859
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,690
Humans are nothing more than livestock.

860
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,950
We prey on them as they prey on beasts.

861
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:04,960
This is the rule of nature!

862
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,100
Your time is coming to an end.

863
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,770
Your kind must face extinction.

864
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:25,790
You cannot survive; you must die.

865
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:28,020
That is the rule of nature.

866
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:31,840
Ah...very strong words for a dhampir.

867
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:37,670
But you seem to forget...our spirits are eternal.

868
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,480
No, Carmila; nothing lasts forever.

869
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:44,890
I see.

870
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,450
I should have known better than to reason with your kind, dhampir hunter.

871
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,490
I guess my only option is to use force.

872
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,000
No...this can't happen!

873
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,910
Are you the son of the vampire king?

874
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,360
Who are you? Who are you, dhampir?

875
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:10,690
Such power...!

876
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,760
Charlotte, come back. I need you; please come back.

877
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,780
Darling, is that you?

878
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,580
Oh yes. It's me...Meier.

879
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:04,490
I'm so happy, Meier, because we are together now. At last.

880
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,870
Together. At last.

881
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:11,050
You made me happy, Meier.

882
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:16,550
You let me dream. You let me dream of our beautiful trip to the stars.

883
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,830
Our dream.

884
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:21,320
Our beautiful, wonderful dream.

885
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:25,670
It's not a dream. We are going to those stars, Charlotte.

886
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:28,220
Oh, my dear one.

887
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:32,080
You and I will get away from here.

888
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:37,120
We will fly together to the city of the night where we were meant to be free from all of this

889
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:40,280
where you can rest, my love, finally, and be free.

890
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:45,340
Yes...freedom! At last....

891
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,510
My precious, precious love.

892
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:10,910
Let's go...away from here.

893
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,370
Stop right there, Meier.

894
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,000
I'm taking her back...back to her family who loved her.

895
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,190
She knew I loved her best of all.

896
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:40,950
You can't understand it. You've never loved a human.

897
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,970
I've never killed one, either.

898
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:49,400
You struggle to resist this nature of ours, but it can't last forever, D.

899
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,020
The urge for their blood is stronger.

900
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:56,100
If that day comes, then another will hunt me.

901
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:57,860
It's as simple as that.

902
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:35,580
What a waste. What a sad waste.

903
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:13,390
Enough of killing. Enough of misery and death.

904
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:16,300
I've had enough.

905
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:38,620
I've ... had enough!

906
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:11,670
Why ... did you miss ... my heart?

907
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,400
She's dead. The ring is all I need.

908
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,580
I'll take it to her father.

909
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:33,580
As proof.

910
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:50,390
Mind giving me a ride just as far as the next town?

911
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,110
I'd appreciate it.

912
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:59,250
That reward money would rightfully be mine, y'know.

913
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:01,450
But hey, I'm generous.

914
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:04,080
I'll let you keep it just this one time.

915
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,970
Where is he taking her?

916
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:45,840
Away from here.

917
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,090
Away

918
01:32:56,510 --> 01:32:57,700
Fly, COME ON!

919
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,870
You can make it

920
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,700
come on!

921
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,480
Fly away ...

922
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,450
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in this resting place to bid farewell to our sister.

923
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,210
Into your gentle arms we commend her gracious spirit.

924
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:22,410
Take her to yourself and give her safe haven.

925
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,880
And though she struggled in life, now she knows your blessed peace.

926
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,630
For all who question will find answers,

927
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:38,160
and all who love will find contentment, joy, and peace eternal.

928
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:42,210
For now we see as through a glass darkly,

929
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:46,310
but then we shall see clearly, face to face.

930
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,450
Mister!

931
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:55,210
Wait!

932
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,090
Mister, WAIT!

933
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:05,400
excuse me, sir, but...I was wondering if you knew my grandmother Leila.

934
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:12,900
Yes ... it's you, isn't it.

935
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,160
My grandmother told me about you,

936
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:20,010
so...I'd be honored if you'd come to our house, my dad would be so happy

937
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:21,320
please?

938
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:24,900
I appreciate your kindness.

939
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:28,220
Oh, c'mon. We don't live very far.

940
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,600
I just came here to keep a promise to an old ... friend of mine.

941
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:40,450
She was afraid no one would mourn her death.

942
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:42,450
I'm glad she was so wrong.

943
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,370
Huh?

944
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,070
OK, I guess I see. .....

945
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:53,040
Anyway, thank you for coming, sir.

946
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,250
G'bye!

947
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:07,700
G-bye!!

948
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:13,650
Well, that was nice.

949
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,240
You're not so bad after all.

950
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,360
You just dress bad.
