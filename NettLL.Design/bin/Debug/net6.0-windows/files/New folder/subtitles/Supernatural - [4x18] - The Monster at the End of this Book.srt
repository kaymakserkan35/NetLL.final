1
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,300
Uh...can I help you?

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
Sure hope so. Agents deyoung and shaw.

3
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,200
Just need to ask you a few questions.

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,000
Notice anything strange in the
building, last couple of days?

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,900
Like what?

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,600
Well, some other tenants
anreported flickering lights.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,700
I don't think so. Why?

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
What about noises?

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Any tering in the
walls? Kind of like rats?

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>And the fbi is investigating
a rodent problem?</i>

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
What about cold spots?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,200
??? Sudden drops in romperature?

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,000
I know it

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,700
You guys are larping, aren't you???

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
- Excuse me?
- You're fans.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,100
- Fans of what?
- What is "larping"?

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,400
Like you don't know.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,400
Live-Action
role-Play

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
And pretty hardcore, too.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm sorry,e no idea what
you're talking about.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,000
You're asking questions
like the building's haunted.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Like those guys from the books.
What are they called? Uh...

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,900
"Supernatural."

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,200
Two guys, use fake
I.D.S with rock aliases,

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Hunt down ghosts, demons, vampires.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,300
What are their names? Uh...

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,000
Steve and Dirk? Uh, Sal and Dane?

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,800
Sam and Dean?

29
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,300
That's it!

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>You're saying this is a book?</i>

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,500
Books. It was a series.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,700
Didn't sl a lot of copies, though.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,700
Kind of had more of an
underground-Cult following.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's see. Um...

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,000
Ah. Yeah

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,000
That's the first one of them.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,700
"Supernatural" by Carver Edlund.

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,900
"Along a lonely california highway, a mysterious
woman in white lures men to their deaths."

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,800
Give me that.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,900
We're gonna need all the copies
of "supernatural" you've got.

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,800
<Font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.Com

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,100
<Font color="#ffff00">sync:misandry radorer mzinfo</font>

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,900
Supernatural 418

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,000
The monster at the end of this book

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,500
This is freakin' insane.

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,100
How's this guy know all this stuff?

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,700
<i>- You got me. 
- Everything isin here. I mean everything.</i>

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,400
From the racist truck
to -- to me having sex.

49
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
I'm full-Frontal in here, dude.

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,900
How come we haven't
heard of them before?

51
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,200
They're pretty obscure.

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,900
I mean, almost zero
circulation. Uh, started in '05.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,800
The publisher put out a couple
dozen before going bankrupt.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And, uh, the last one --
"No rest for the wicked" --

55
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Ends with you going to hell.

56
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,300
???Ate freaking insane

57
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,400
<i>Check out. Actually fans.</i>

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
??? T still. L.His?

59
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,100
Yeah.

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
Although for fans, they sure do
complain a lot. Listen to this --

61
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,600
Simpatico says "the
demon story line is trite,

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
Clich'd, and overall craptastic."

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,100
Yeah, well, screw you,
simpatico. We lived it.

64
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,900
Yeah. Well, keep on reading.

65
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,800
It gets better.

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,600
There are "Sam girls"
and "Dean girls" and --

67
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,100
What's a "slash fan"?

68
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,900
As in...

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,300
Sam-Slash-Dean.

70
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,900
Together.

71
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,100
<i>Like, together together?</i>

72
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,500
Yeah.

73
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,800
They do know we're brothers, right?

74
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,400
Doesn't seem to matter.

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Oh, come on. That...

76
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
That's just sick.

77
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,300
We got to find this carver edlund.

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,900
- Ah, ht n easy.
- Not?

79
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,200
Los like "carveris a p no known address.

80
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,400

81
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,500
Somebody ??

82
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,300
So published the "supernatural" books?

83
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,100
Yep. Yeah. Gosh. These books...

84
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,600
You know, they never really
got the attention they deserved.

85
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,600
All anybody wants to readanymore I

86
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,000
You know -- "Doctor
sexy, m.D."? Please.

87
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,600
Right. Well, we're hoping
that our article can ...

88
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,500
Shine a light on an
underappreciated series.

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,500
Yeah, ye, because, you know,???

90
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,000
Then m-Maybe we could
start publishing again.

91
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,300
No, no, no god, no.

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,200
I mean, why -- Why would you want
to do that? You know, it's, uh,

93
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Such a complete series,

94
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,700
What with Dean going to hell and all.

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,400
My god! That was one of my favorite
ones, because Dean was so...

96
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Strong...

97
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,200
And sad and brave.

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,900
And Sam...

99
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,100
I mean, the best parts
are when they'd cry.

100
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,300
You know, like
in -- In "heart,"

101
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,100
When Sam had to kill Madison, the first
woman since Jessica he really loved.

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,900
And in "home," when
Dean had to call J	ohn

103
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,300
And ask him for help.

104
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,700
Gosh...

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If only real men were so open and in-

106
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
In touchwith their feel???

107
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,600
<i>Real men?</i>

108
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,200
I mean, no offense.

109
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,600
How often do you cry like that, hmm?

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,400
Well, right now, I'm
crying on the inside.

111
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,900
Is that supposed to be funny?

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,100
Lady, this whole thing is funny.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,300
How do I know you two are legit, hmm?

114
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,900
Oh, trust me. We, uh... we're legit.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Well, I don't want any smart-Ass
article making fun of my boys.

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
- No! R.No,
- No, that's...

117
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,300
We -- We are
actually, um...

118
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,100
...big fans.

119
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,100
Hmm. You've read the books?

120
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,600
Cover???

121
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,800
What's the year and model of the car?

122
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,600
1967 chevy impala.

123

January 24th is Dean's.

126
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,600
Sam's score on the lsat?

127
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,600

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,600
74?

129
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,300
Dean's favorite song?

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,900
It's a tie.

131
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Between zep's "ramble on" and
"traveling riverside blues."

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,900
O youwant to know?

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,300

Oh, no. 'T.

Know, get the "supernatural"
story in his own words.

137
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,700
Very private. Like salinger.

138
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,200
Please.

139
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,300
Like I said --

...big fans.

142
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,100
Awesome.

143
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
You know what?

144
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,600
I got one, too.

145
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,400
<i>Whoa. You are a fan.</i>

146
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,100
Okay. His name's Chuck shurley.

147
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,100
And he's a genius,
so don't piss him off.

148
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,100
"Sam and Dean

149
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,500

150
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,900
<i>"...Approached the ramshackle
house with trepidation."</i>

151
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,000
"Did they really want

152
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,800
"That lay beyond that door?

Determination."

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,500
Ugh!

159
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,800
You Chuck shurley?

160
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,800
The Chuck shurley who wrote
the "supernatural" books?

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,600
Maybe why

162
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,100
I'm Dean. Sam.

163
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,600
The Dean and saming
you've been writing about.

164
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,000
Look, uh...

165
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,900
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,700
Really, I do. It's, uh, it's
always nice to hear from the fans.

167
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,300
But, uh, for your own good,

168
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,900
I strongly suggest you get a life.

169
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,900
See, here's the thing.

170
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,600
We have a life.

171
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,600
You've been using it
to write your books.

172
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,700
Now, wait a minute.
Now, this isn't funny.

173
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,300
Damn straight, it's not funny.

174
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,800
Look, we just want to
know how you're doing it.

175
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,800
I'm not doing anything.

176
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,300
- Are you a hunter?
- What?

177
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,500
No. I'm a writer.

178
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Then how do you know
so much about demons

179
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,100
???

180
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Is this some kind of "misery" thing?

181
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,400
Ah, it is, isn't it?
It's a "misery" thing!

182
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,700
It's not a "misery" thing.
Believe me, we are not fans.

183
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,700
Well, then, what do you want?!

184
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,900
I'm. And that's Dean.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
Sam and Dean are fictional characters.

186
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,200
I made them up! They're not real!

187
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,000
- Are those real guns?
- Yup.

188
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,800
These are real rock salts
these are real fake ids

189
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,800
Well, I got to hand it to you guys.
You really are my number-One fans.

190
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,800
So, I-I think I've got
some posters in the house.

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,200
- Chuck, stop.
- Please wait.

192
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,500
- Please, don't hurt me.
- How much do you know?

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,800
Do you know about the angels?
Or Lilith breaking the seals?

194
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,100
<i>Wait a minute. How do youbout that?</i>

195
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
The question is how do you know.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,900
Cause I wrote it?

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,900
You kept writing it

198
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,400
You know but after the publisher got
bankrupt, but those books never came out.????

199
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,700
Okay, wait a minute.

200
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,200
This is some kind of
joke, right? Did that --

201
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,600
Did phil put you up to this?

202
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,400
Well, nice to meet you. I'm Dean
winchester, and this is my brother, Sam.

203
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,500
The last names were never in the books.

204
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,300
I never told any about that.
I never even wrote that down.

205
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:00,961
Oh! Oh, you're still there.

206
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:01,849
Yup.

207
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,224
You're not ??Ion.

208
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:03,988
Nope.

209
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:07,179
Well, there's only one explanation.

210
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,359
Obviously I'm a god.

211
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,511
You're not a god.

212
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:11,754
How else do you explain it?

213
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:14,095
I write things and
then they come to life.

214
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,846
Yeah, no, I'm definitely a god.

215
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:18,950
A cruel, cruel, capricious god.

216
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:21,646
The things I put
you through --

217
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:23,253
The physical beatings alone.

218
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:24,542
Yeah, we're still in one piece.

219
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,591
I killed your father.

220
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:27,884
I burned your mother alive.

221
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:31,430
And then you had to go through the
whole horrific deal again with jessica.

222
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,800
- Chuck...
- All for what?

223
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,110
All for the sake of literary symmetry.

224
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,847
I toyed with your lives,
your emotions, for...

225
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:43,615
- ...Entertainment.
- You didn't toy with us, Chuck, okay?

226
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:44,742
You didn't create us.

227
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:48,186
Did you really have to
live through the bugs?

228
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:49,658
Yeah.

229
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,419
What about the ghost ship?

230
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,640
Yes, that too.

231
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:55,128
I am so sorry.

232
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,869
I mean, horror is one thing,

233
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,249
But to be forced to live bad writing...

234
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,672
If I would have known it was real,

235
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:04,049
I would have done another pass.

236
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,191
Chuck, you're not a god!

237
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:07,461
We think you're probably just psychic.

238
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,339
No.

239
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,088
If I were psychic, you
think I'd be writing?

240
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:13,561
Writing is hard.

241
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,162
It seems that somehow, you're just...

242
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:17,336
Focused on our lives.

243
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:19,166
Yeah, like laser-Focused.

244
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:21,640
Are you working on anything right now?

245
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,445
- Holy crap.
- What?

246
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,042
The er...??

247
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:33,889
It's, uh, it's kind of weird.

248
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:34,710
"Weird" how?

249
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:37,523
It's very vonnegut.

250
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:40,004
"Slaughterhouse-Five," vonnegut,
or "cat's cradle," vonnegut?

251
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:41,638
- What?
- What?

252
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:46,746
It's, uh, "kilgore trout," vonnegut.

253
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:49,070
I wrote myself into it.

254
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,371
I wrote myself, at my house...

255
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:56,227
Confronted by my characters.

256
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,886
"I was sitting in a laundromat,"

257
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:06,817
Reading about myself
sitting in a laundromat

258
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:08,591
Reading about myself
-- My head hurts.

259
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,197
There's got to be something
this guy's not telling us.

260
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:16,037
"Sam tossed his gigantic
darks into the machine.

261
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:18,021
"He was starting to
have doubts about Chuck,

262
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,883
About whether he was
telling the whole truth.

263
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:22,205
- Stop it.
- "'Stop it,' Sam said."

264
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,490
Guess what you do next.

265
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,084
"Sam turned his back on Dean.

266
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,232
His face, brooding and pen."

267
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:32,825
I mean, I don't know how he's doing it,

268
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:33,926
But this guy is doing it.

269
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:35,323
I can't see your face,
but those are definitely

270
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,126
Your "brooding and pensive" shoulders.

271
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,187
You just thought I was a dick.

272
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:46,929
E guy's good.

273
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,565
So...

274
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:29,295
You wrote another chapter?

275
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,629
This was all so muchier
before you were real.

276
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,042
Can take just spit it out.

277
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,356
You especially are not gonna like this.

278
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:37,282
<i>I didn't like hell.</i>

279
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:40,932
It's Lilith.

280
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,241
She's coming for Sam.

281
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,278
Coming to get him?

282
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:48,070
When?

283
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,850
Tonight.

284
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:53,541
She's just gonna show up? Here?

285
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:55,276
Uh...

286
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,009
"Lilih patted the bed seductively.

287
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:04,148
"Unable to deny his
desire, Sam succumbed,

288
00:14:04,148 --> 00:14:07,348
And they sank into the
throes fiery demonic passion."

289
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,289
You're kidding me, right?

290
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:14,829
- You think this is funny?
- You don't?

291
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:15,506
I mean, come on.

292
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:18,113
"Fiery demonic passion"?

293
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:19,364
It's just a first draft.

294
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:21,546
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Lilith is a little girl.

295
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,935
No, uh, this
time she's a --

296
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:29,209
"Comely dental hygienist
ington, indiana."

297
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,420
Great. Perfect.

298
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:33,969
So what happens after the...

299
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:36,335
"Fiery demonic" whatever?

300
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,924
I don't know, that
hasn't come to me yet.

301
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:40,631
Dean, look, there's
nothing to worry about.

302
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,716
<i>Lilith and me? In bed?</i>

303
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:47,009
How does this whole
psychic thing of yours work?

304
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:48,142
You mean my process?

305
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,867
Yes, your "process."

306
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,695
Well, it usually starts with a headache.

307
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,011
A really bad headache.

308
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:57,771
Aspirin is useless, so...

309
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:59,123
I drink.

310
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,740
Until I fall asleep.

311
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,570
The first time it happened, I
thought it was just a crazy dream.

312
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,098
The first time you dreamt about us?

313
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:06,054
It flowed.

314
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,147
It just it it kept flo

315
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:10,851
Still does. I-I can't stop it, really.

316
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:12,500
You can't
seriously believe --

317
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,266
Humor me.

318
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,460
Look, why don't we, we just...

319
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:25,635
Take a look at these
and see what's what.

320
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,219
You
--

321
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,247
...knew you were gonna
ask for that. Yeah.

322
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,817
Dean, come on.

323
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,755
"The minivan accident wasn't that bad,

324
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:40,250
"But Dean was still seeing stars.

325
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:44,537
"He scratched absently at the
pink-Flower band-Aids on his face."

326
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,182
So?

327
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:47,435
So, I've seen you gushing blood.

328
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:51,389
You'd use duct tape and bar rags before
you'd put on a pink-Flower band-Aid.

329
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:53,264
- What's your point?
- My point is this --

330
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:56,283
All of this -- I-Is totally
implausible, it's nuts.

331
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:57,598
<i>He's been right about everything so far.</i>

332
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:59,617
You think he's just gonna
ground out at first now?

333
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,545
"Dean slid behind the
wheel of his beloved impala

334
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:05,361
"And drove off,

335
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,999
"The plastic tarp on the rear window
flapping like the wings of a crow."

336
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:09,669
A tarp?

337
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,032
Yeah. On the rear window.

338
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,139
And you drive it like that.

339
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,778
Well, he might be
wrong about the details,

340
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,467
But doesn't mean he's
wrong about the end result.

341
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:16,378
So we just got to run?

342
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:18,007
We are a rom?? Way...

343
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:20,631
From ready for a face-To-Face
death match with Lilith.

344
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:27,045
???

345
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,946
What seems to be the prm?

346
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:34,035
Bridge is out ahead.

347
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,955
We're just trying to get out of town.

348
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:36,805
Yeah, afraid not.

349
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:38,729
- Is there a detour?
- Nope.

350
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,544
There's not a side road
that takes us to the highway?

351
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:43,722
To get to the highway, you
have to cross that river.

352
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:45,671
To cross the river, you
have to take that bridge

353
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,218
- How deep's the river?
- Sorry.

354
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:48,994
Afraid you boys are gonna have
to spend the night in town.

355
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:00,339
Hey, this could be a good thing.

356
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:03,351
I mean, if this is what puts
us on the path to Lilith,

357
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:05,688
Then all we got to do
is get off the path.

358
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:06,343
How do you mean?

359
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:08,115
It's a blueprint of what not to do.

360
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,223
I mean, if the pages
say that we go left --

361
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:11,691
- Then we go right.
- Exactly.

362
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:13,114
We get off-Book.

363
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:14,624
We never make it to the end.

364
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:16,198
It's opposite day.

365
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,606
It says that we, uh,
we get into a fight,

366
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:19,933
So no fighting.

367
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:21,909
No research for you...

368
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,727
No bacon cheeseburger for you.

369
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:26,086
Yeah, no problem.

370
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,375
I'll just order something else.

371
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:29,696
Hi, uh, what's good?

372
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,278
Well, if you like burgers,
oprah's girlfriend said

373
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:34,799
We had the best bacon
cheeseburgers in the country.

374
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:35,912
Really?

375
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:37,836
I'll just have the cobb salad, please.

376
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:44,565
I'll have the... veggie tofu burger.

377
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:49,301
Thanks.

378
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:52,887
- This whole thing's ridiculous.
- Lilith is ridiculous?

379
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:55,141
The idea of me hooking up with her is.

380
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,067
Right.

381
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,125
'Cause something like
that can never happen.

382
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,471
Dean, for the first time,

383
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:06,624
We have warning that Lilith is close.

384
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:09,644
So?

385
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:10,906
So...

386
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:13,089
We've got the jump on her.

387
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:16,303
If we know when she's
coming, we know where she's --

388
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:18,383
This is an opportunity.

389
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:18,979
Are
you --

390
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:25,674
It frustrates me when you
say such reckless things.

391
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:29,013
Well, it frustrates me when
you'd rather hide that fight.

392
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:37,509
Cobb salad for you.

393
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,322
Ane tofu veggie burger for you.

394
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:41,183
Thank you.

395
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,068
It's not hiding. It's being smart.

396
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,369
It's picking your battles.

397
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,276
And is a battle that we
are not ready to fight.

398
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:00,133
Oh, my god.

399
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,669
This is delicious.

400
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:04,056
Tofu is amazing!

401
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:05,858
I am so sorry.

402
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:08,148
I gave you the bacon
cheeseburger by mistake.

403
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:23,732
Dude, this place charges by the hour.

404
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:26,378
Yeah, well, the book says Lilith
finds you at the red motel.

405
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,009
Hence, the uh, ???

406
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,288
It's opposite day, remember?

407
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:41,584
What are you doing?

408
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:44,131
Couple of x bags ought
to Lilith-Proof the room.

409
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:46,770
So, what? I'm supposed to
just hole up here all night?

410
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:48,093
That's exactly what
you're gonna do, okay?

411
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:49,167
And no research.

412
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,231
I don't care
what you do --

413
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,945
Use the magic fingers or, watch ???

414
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:54,680
??

415
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,592
Oh, dude, come on.

416
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh dude. Com on

417
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,800
???

418
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,000
What you gonna do?

419
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Well, the pages say that I spend
all day riding around in the impala.

420
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,800
So I'm gonna go park her.

421
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
Behave yourself, would you?

422
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,900
No homework.

423
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,700
Watch some porn.

424
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,500
Tureador

425
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,800
Re d

426
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,900
Hey!

427
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,200
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

428
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,500
Thanks for coming.

429
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
Ah, sure.

430
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,600
Um...

431
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,800
I was just wondering
how much you know...

432
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,300
About me.

433
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
What do you mean?

434
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,300
<i>Have you seen ons of me</i>

435
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,700
When I'm not with Dean?

436
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,700
Oh...

437
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,800
You want to know if I
know about the demon blood.

438
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,000
You didn't tell Dean.

439
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,000
I didn't even write it into the books.

440
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,400
I was afraid it would make
you look unsympathetic.

441
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Unsympathetic?

442
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,300
Yeah, come on, Sam.

443
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,300
I mean, sucking blood?

444
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
You got to know that's wrong.

445
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
It scares the hell out of me.

446
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,500
I mean, I feel it inside of me. I...

447
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,800
I wish to god I could stop.

448
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,200
But you keep going back.

449
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,800
What choice have I got?

450
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
If it helps me kill
Lilith op the apocalypse --

451
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,100
Ght that was Dean's job.

452
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,100
That's what the angels say, right?

453
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,100
De not...

454
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,200
<i>...he's not Dean lately.</i>

455
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,000
Ince he got out of hell.

456
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,700
He needs help.

457
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,500
So you got to carry the weight?

458
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,900
Well, he's looked
after me my whole life.

459
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,700
I can't return the favor?

460
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Yeah, sure you can.

461
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,300
I mean if that's what this is.

462
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,100
What else would it be?

463
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,700
I don't know.

464
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,300
Maybe the demon blood
makes you feel stronger?

465
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,100
More in control?

466
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,000
No.

467
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,000
That's not true.

468
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm sorry, Sam.

469
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
I know it's a
terrible burden --

470
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,400
Feeling that it all
rests on your shoulders.

471
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,400
???

472
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,100
All rest on my shoulders?

473
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,300
That seems to be where
the story's headed.

474
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,800
Am I strong enough to
stop Lilith tonight?

475
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,700
I don't know.

476
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,300
I haven't seen that far yet.

477
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,900
Omg ???

478
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,100
- Stars
- ???

479
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,900
I'm so sorry. I just didn't
see you. Are you okay?

480
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And sorry about...

481
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,600
You know.

482
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
M-My daughter's going
through a doctor phase.

483
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,600
What are you talking about?

484
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,600
You're better now.

485
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,600
, no...

486
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,800
- Dean.
- I take it you knew I'd be here.

487
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,700
You look terrible.

488
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,400
That's 'cause I just got
hit by a minivan, Chuck.

489
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh.

490
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,200
That it?

491
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,700
Every damn thida you
write about me comes true.

492
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,300
And all you have to say is "oh"?!

493
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,600
Please don't yell at me.

494
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,100
Why do I get feeling

495
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,700
There's ththing that
you're not telling us?

496
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,600
How you know what you
know, for starters!

497
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,300
???

498
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,100
I don't know how I know. I just do.

499
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
That's not good enough.

500
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,500
How the hell are you doing this?!

501
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,400
Dean, let him go.

502
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,300
This man is to be protected.

503
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,300
Why?

504
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,100
He's a prophet of the lord.

505
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
You...

506
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,400
You're castiel... aren't you?

507
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,000
It's an honor to meet you, Chuck.

508
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,300
I...???

509
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,800
Whoa, whoa, what? This guy, a prophet?

510
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,100
Come on, he's
-- He's...

511
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,300
<i>He'scticallya penthouse foru</i>

512
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,500
Did you know about this?

513
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,700
I, uh, I might have dreamt about it.

514
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,000
And you didn't tell us?!

515
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,900
It was too preposterous.

516
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,600
Not to mention arrogant.

517
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,700
I mean, writing yourself into the
story is one thing, but as a prophet?

518
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,500
That's like m. Night-Level douchiness.

519
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,700
This is the guy who decides our fate?

520
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,600
He isn't deciding anything.
He's a mouthpiece --

521
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,800
A conduit for the inspired word.

522
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,600
The word?

523
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,100
The word of god?

524
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,900
What, like the new new testament?

525
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,800
One day, these books -- They'll
be known as the winchester gospel.

526
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,700
You got to be kidding me.

527
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,900
I am not... kidding you.

528
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,100
If you'd both please
excuse me one minute.

529
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,700
Him? Really?

530
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,500
You should've seen luke.

531
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,900
Why'd he get tapped?

532
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,700
I don't know how prophets are chosen.

533
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,600
The order comes from high up on
the celestial chain of command.

534
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
How high?

535
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,500
Very.

536
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Well, whatever. How
do we get around this?

537
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,200
Around what?

538
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,700
The Sam-Lith love connection.

539
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,700
How do we stop it from happening?

540
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,500
What the prophet has written

541
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,200
Can't be unwritten.

542
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,800
As he has seen it,

543
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,500
So it shall come to pass.

544
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,000
Re d

545
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
Come on. We're getting out of here.

546
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,400
What? Where?

547
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Anywhere, okay?

548
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,000
Out of this motel, out of this town.

549
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,700
I don't care if we got to
swim, we are getting out.

550
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,100
Dude, where are all the hex bags?

551
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,000
I burned them.

552
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,100
- You what? 
- Look, if Lilith sis coming, which is a big "if" --

553
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,500
No, no, no. It's more than an "if."

554
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
Chuck is not a psychic.

555
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,800
He's a prophet.

556
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,200
- What?
- Cass showed up, and apparently Chuck is writing the gospel of us.

557
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,600
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's get the hell out of here.

558
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,500
No.

559
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,000
Lith is gonna slaughter you.

560
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,600
Maybe she will, maybe she won't.

561
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,900
So what? You think you can take her?

562
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,800
Only one way to find out,
Dean, and I say bring her on.

563
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,300
- Sam...
- You think I'll do it, don't you?

564
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,400
- You think I'll go dark side.
- Yes! Okay? Yes.

565
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,800
The way you've been acting lately?
The things you've beendoing?

566
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,700
Oh, I know.

567
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,600
How you ripped alastair apart like it
was nothing, like you were swatting a fly.

568
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,200
Cass told me, okay?

569
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
What else did he tell you?

570
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,700
Nothing I don't already know.

571
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,100
That you've been using
your psychic crap,

572
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,200
And you've been getting stronger.

573
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,000
We just don't know why,
and we don't know how.

574
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,400
- It's not what you think.
- Then what is it, Sam?

575
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,900
'Cause I'm at a total loss.

576
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,400
Are you coming or not?

577
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,100
No.

578
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,300
Well,I feel stupid doing this.

579
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,660
But...I am fresh out of options.

580
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660


582
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,270
I need some help.

583
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,730
I'm praying,okay?

584
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,380
Come on.

585
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,260
Please.

586
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,430
Prayer is a sign of faith.

587
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,980
This is a good thing,Dean.

588
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,350
So does that mean you'll help me?

589
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,230
I'm not sure what I can do.

590
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,010
Drag Sam out
of here -- Now.

591
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,990
Before Lilith shows up.

592
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,060
It's a prophecy.

593
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,700
I can't interfere.

594
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,940
You have tested me and
thrown me every which way.

595
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,210
And I have never asked for anything.

596
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,740
Not a damn thing.

597
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,840
But now I'm asking.

598
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,840
I need your help.

599
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,200
Please.

600
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,110
What you're asking,it's...

601
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,030
Not within my power to do.

602
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,800
Why? 'Cause it's "divine prophecy"?

603
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,290
Yes.

604
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,280
So,what -- We're just
supposed to sit around

605
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,840
A
- And wait for it to happen?

606
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,030
I'm sorry.

607
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,360
Screw you.

608
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,490
You and your mission.

609
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,780
Your god.

610
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,190
If you don't help me now,

611
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,880
Then when the time comes

612
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,090
And you needme...

613
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,270
...don't bother knocking.

614
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,020
Dean.

615
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,780
Dean!

616
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,410
What?!

617
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,300
You must understand

618
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,270
Whyi can't intercede.

619
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,630
Prophets are very special.

620
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,420
They're protected.

621
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,030
I get that.

622
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,930
If anything threatens a prophet,

623
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,740
Anything at all,

624
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,940
An archangel will appear
to destroy that threat.

625
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,890
Archangels are fierce.

626
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,930
They're absolute.

627
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,460
They're heaven's most terrifying weapon.

628
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,400
And these archangels,
they're tied to prophets?

629
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:28,940
Yes.

630
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:35,610
So if a prophet was in
the same room as a demon --

631
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,570
Then the most fearsome wrath of
heaven would rain down on that demon.

632
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,660
Just so you understand...

633
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,940
Why I can't help.

634
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,420
Thanks,Cass.

635
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,040
Good luck.

636
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,830
What are you doing here?
I didn't write this.

637
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,340
Come on.

638
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,380
I need you to come with me.

639
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:02,900
What? Where?

640
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,110
To the motel where Sam is.

641
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,110
That's where Lilith is.

642
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,900
Yeah,exactly.

643
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,930
I need you to stop her.

644
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,970
Are you insane?

645
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,620
Lith?

646
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,110
I know what she's capable of,

647
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,730
Dean -- I
wrote her.

648
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,610
All right, listen to me.

649
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,980
You have an archangel
tethered to you,okay?

650
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,300
All you got to do is
show up and boom! --

651
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,580
Lith gets smoked.

652
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,580
But I-I haven't seen that yet.

653
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,600
T- The
story --

654
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,060
Chuck,you're the only
shot that I've got left.

655
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,080
But...I'm just a writer.

656
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,850
This isn't a story anymore,man.

657
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,190
This is real!

658
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,220
And you're in it!

659
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,370
Now,I need you to get
off your ass and fight.

660
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,960
Come on,Chuck.

661
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,070
No friggin' way.

662
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,340
Okay,well,then,

663
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,130
How about
this --

664
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,460
I've got a gun in my pocket,

665
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,430
And if you don't come with
me, I'll blow your brains out.

666
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,980
I thought you said I was
protected by an archangel.

667
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,050
Well, interesting exercise.

668
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,340
Let's see who the quicker draw is.

669
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,600
Hello,Sam.

670
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,030
I've been waiting for you.

671
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,210
Where's the knife,Sam?

672
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,210
On the nightstand.

673
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,460
By the bed.

674
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,870
You're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that.

675
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,240
How 'bout this?

676
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,560
You're strong.

677
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,920
But you're notthatstrong.

678
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,310
Not yet.

679
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,810
So why don't you throw me around then?

680
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,240
Because I can't

681
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,410
And you know it.

682
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,490
You're immune to my charms.

683
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,810
Seems we're at a stalemate.

684
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,480
Why are you here?

685
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,370
To talk.

686
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,320
Yeah,well,

687
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,180
I'm not interested.

688
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,290
Hmm...

689
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,700
Even if I'm offering

690
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,950
To stand down...

691
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,130
From the seals...

692
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,810
The apocalypse...

693
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,570
All of it?

694
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,060
You expect me to believe that?

695
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,540
Honestly? No.

696
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,090
You were always the smart one.

697
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,870
But it's the truth.

698
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,880
You can end it,Sam.

699
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,250
Right here,right now.

700
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,060
I'll stop breaking seals,

701
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,080
Lucifer keeps rotting in his cage.

702
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,280
All you have to do is agree to my terms.

703
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,630
Why would you back down?

704
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,200
Why now?

705
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,380
Turns out, I don't survive this war.

706
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,100
Killed off,right before
the good part starts.

707
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,400
What do you want?

708
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,550
For it to go back to the way it was.

709
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,710
Before I had angels to deal with 24/7.

710
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,610
The good old days,

711
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,810
When it was all baby blood all the time.

712
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,340
And what do you want in return?

713
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,520
Your head on a stick.

714
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,070
Dean's,too.

715
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,120
Call it a consolation prize.

716
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,320
So what do you say,Sam?

717
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:52,810
Self-Sacrifice is the
winchester way,isn't it?

718
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,810
You really think I'm stupid
enough to fall for this?

719
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,600
I make a deal, I have to follow through.

720
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,390
Those are the rules,

721
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,700
And you know it.

722
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,700
Are you really so arrogant

723
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,070
That you would put your life before
the lives of 6billioninnocent people?

724
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,780
Maybe it's all that demon blood
pumping through your pipes.

725
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,310
Man after my own heart.

726
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,130
You think I'm likeyou?

727
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,530
I amnothinglike you.

728
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,600
Then prove it.

729
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,360
Going once.

730
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,890
Going twice.

731
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:32,460
Fine.

732
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,310
Swell.

733
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,700
By the way,a contract with
me will take more than a kiss.

734
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,200
A lot more.

735
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,630
Don't worry.

736
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,210
The dental hygienist in here?

737
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,450
She wants it bad.

738
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,720
I am the prophet Chuck!

739
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,730
You've got to be joking.

740
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,070
This is no joke.

741
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,640
See,Chuck here's got an
archangel on his shoulder.

742
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,760
You've got about 10 seconds
before this room is full of wrath

743
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,630
And you're a piece of charcoal.

744
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,720
You sure you want to tangle with that?

745
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,250
So deals,huh?

746
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,920
That's what she said.

747
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,570
To call the
whole thing off --

748
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,430
Angels,seals,lucifer rising,

749
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,360
The whole nine?

750
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,750
That was the gist of it.

751
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,020
Huh.

752
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,710
What?

753
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,310
You didn't think once about taking it?

754
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,060
You kidding me?

755
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,080
You spent all day trying to
talk me off the Lilith track.

756
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm just saying...

757
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,300
She would have found some
way to weasel out of it.

758
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,670
And all it would have
cost us was our lives.

759
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:03,390
Yeah,

760
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,230
I guess you're right.

761
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,100
Anyway.

762
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,350
That's not the point.

763
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,100
What's the point?

764
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:07,720
The point is,

765
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,750
She's scared.

766
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,880
I could see it.

767
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,890
Lilith is running.

768
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,580
Running from what?

769
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,330
Don't know.

770
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,390
But she was telling the
truth about one thing.

771
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,570
What's that?

772
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,000
She's not gonna survive the apocalypse.

773
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,000
I'll make sure of that.

774
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,230
Did you see it?

775
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,640
Who are you?

776
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,500
I'm Zachariah.

777
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,660
You may know me

778
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,580
From your work.

779
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,630
What do you want?

780
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,500
Did you see it?

781
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,760
Is it true?

782
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,610
Is all of that...really going to happen?

783
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,180
Have you been wrong so far?

784
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,010
I got to warn Sam and Dean.

785
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,260
I wouldn't advise it.

786
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,360
People shouldn't know too
much about their own destiny.

787
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,170
You try...and I'll stop you.

788
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,440
Where are you going?

789
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,740
To go kill myself.

790
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,790
Don't be melodramatic, Chuck.

791
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,770
We'd only bring you back to life.

792
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,530
What am I supposed to do?

793
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,310
What you always do.

794
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,720
Write.

795
00:41:57,970 --> 00:43:57,970
