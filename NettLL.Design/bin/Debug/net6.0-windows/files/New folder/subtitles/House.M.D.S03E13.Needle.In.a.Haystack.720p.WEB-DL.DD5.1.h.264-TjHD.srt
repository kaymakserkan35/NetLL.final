2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,000
Wait. We shouldn't...
We shouldn't be doing this.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,170
What? You're not having fun?

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,340
It's not that. I just...

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,180
Rather be with the boys?

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,480
No.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,380
Well, then come on.

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,310
(BANGING)

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,690
You kids need any help?

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,170
No. No, we're fine.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,390
Car trouble?

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,560
No.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,330
Then why are you here?

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,670
We're just talking.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,740
Does she do all the talking?

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,140
Most of it.

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,340
I know what that's like.

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,350
I'm gonna come back
through here in 10 minutes,

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,050
and if you're still here,
I'm gonna call your parents.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,490
Yes, sir. Thank you.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,330
Now, where were we?

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,300
We were going.

23
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,960
In nine minutes.

24
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,880
Wait...

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,550
Stevie? What's wrong?

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,700
Oh, my God!

27
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,630
Help! Someone help me!

28
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,860
(WATER SPLASHING)

29
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,430
Sixteen-year-old
with respiratory arrest.

30
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,410
The only thing I hate more
than a thief
is a crippled thief.

31
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,500
Yeah, me, too.
No sign of trauma, no history

32
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,340
of asthma or...
Who the hell is J. Whitner?

33
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,650
No idea. Stevie Lipa's EKG
and echocardiogram
were normal, but...

34
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,050
Normal is good. Send him home.

35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,390
J. Whitner, doctor.
Who is he,
and where do I find him?

36
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,450
She's the new researcher,
works with Ereshevsky.

37
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,290
Is she hot?
She's in a wheelchair.

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,460
Doesn't mean she's not hot.

39
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,960
Just means
she can't bend over,

40
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,230
so Cuddy has to
bend over backwards.

41
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,740
Sixteen-year-old kid.
ER workup revealed
a bloody pleural effusion.

42
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,140
That's odd.

43
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,640
Yeah, that occurred to me.

44
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,640
What took you so long
to mention it?

45
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,440
No tumors or pneumonia
on the CT.

46
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,710
He passed out
while making out.

47
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,650
If he's into sex,
drugs and rock and roll
can't be that far behind.

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,080
I'm guessing cocaine.

49
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,310
Tox screen was clean.

50
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,790
Just means he wasn't on drugs,
not that he hasn't been
using drugs.

51
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,720
Looks like a plumbing problem
to me. Leaky pipes.

52
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,260
If he popped an aneurysm,
he'd be in the morgue,
not the ER.

53
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,660
That's why you're gonna
do a venogram
instead of an arteriogram.

54
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,060
This is not
a high-pressure burst.
It's a low-pressure leak.

55
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,000
Still could've been drugs
that caused the pipes
to corrode in the first place.

56
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,500
So go look under his mattress.

57
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,270
See if he's got any pills
or powder stashed
with the hand lotion.

58
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,280
Sweet ride. I asked for
the one with the sissy bar
and the banana seat,

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,850
but Santa gave me
this instead. Guess that's
what I get for being naughty.

60
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,290
You must be Dr. House.

61
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,430
Yeah.

62
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,130
So looks like there's been
some sort of mix-up
at the parking office.

63
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,000
They had to move me closer
to the door.

64
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,600
Had to? You don't look
like the type to
pull a weapon.

65
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,610
Wheelchair.
Cane.

66
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,140
I think you should do the
honorable thing and let me
have my space back.

67
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,520
Oh, well,
since you asked so nicely,
wheelchair.

68
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
Cane.
Walking long distances
makes my leg hurt.

69
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,380
And it's easy for me?

70
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,790
Of course not.
Pushing that little lever?

71
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,060
The muscles must burn.
I'm sure the last 10 yards
are pure torture.

72
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,330
Crossing the parking lot
is dangerous.
Cars can't see me.

73
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,770
You ever hit a patch
of black ice with a cane?

74
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,530
No, gosh,
on account of the fact
that I can't walk.

75
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,510
Maybe you should ask
the parking office
for some crampons.

76
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,510
This is about who can most
easily cross the parking lot.
You're the winner.

77
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,680
Oh, and the prize
is apparently a parking space.

78
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,060
There's still no answer
at either one of your
parent's cell numbers.

79
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,430
Is there any other way
we might be
able to contact them?

80
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,960
No, they're in a conference.

81
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,310
They probably had
to turn them off or something.

82
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,500
What does it matter
where they are?
I mean, he's in pain.

83
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,700
You gotta do something.

84
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,040
We need them to sign this.

85
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,240
Why can't he just
sign the papers? He's 16.

86
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,680
Still not an adult.

87
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,620
Then call my parents.
They know him, and they'll
take responsibility,

88
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,310
do whatever you need.
I can't. It won't...

89
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,120
You can't just let him
sit here in agony until
his parents finally decide...

90
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,180
Leah, it's okay.

91
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,020
No, it's not.

92
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,660
I feel like there's an anvil
sitting on my chest.

93
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,590
(MONITOR BEEPING)

94
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,290
You win. I'm doing the
venogram now. We'll deal
with the fallout later.

95
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,920
(COUGHING)

96
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,800
My fingers feel wet.

97
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,390
That's just the dye.
Your nerves can't
tell the difference

98
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,990
between the cold
inside your body and
the wet outside your body.

99
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,570
The nerves can't tell the
difference, or the brain can't
interpret the difference?

100
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,010
A little of both.
You like science?

101
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,780
Looks like
a diffusion pattern.

102
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,520
That's because it's
the venous side. Low pressure.

103
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,610
So Graham's law applies.

104
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,450
You've taken physics already?

105
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,930
No, I just sort of
read up on my own.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,990
I had to teach myself a lot
of stuff, too. Schools sucked
where I grew up.

107
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,860
You go to public or private?

108
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,060
Public.

109
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,030
Leak has to be in
the pulmonary veins
to get in my lungs, right?

110
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,300
Yep.

111
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,040
I don't see anything. Do you?

112
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,540
No.

113
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,410
It doesn't make sense.

114
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,280
How can I have
a bloody effusion
without any bleeding?

115
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,020
(COUGHING)

116
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,270
This is putrid.

117
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,300
Put food-borne parasites
and infections
on the list to check on.

118
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,980
I'll take the bedroom.

119
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,320
Oh. Sorry, I didn't know
there was anyone.

120
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,730
We were just...

121
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,820
Oh, God! I have a gun.

122
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,920
Look, you can take
whatever you want.
My wallet's in my suit.

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,530
Freeze! Freeze!

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,260
I'm calling the cops.

125
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,170
Okay, you don't have a gun,
and you're not
calling the cops.

126
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,070
Oh, no, I'm calling the cops
unless you two
get out of here right now.

127
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,600
"Unless"? Who calls the cops
unless a burglar
does something?

128
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,310
You don't want to
have to explain the affair.

129
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,190
We're not having an affair.

130
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,430
He's got a ring. You don't.

131
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,520
And judging from the state
of the kitchen downstairs

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,160
and the half-vacuumed bedroom,

133
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,860
I'm guessing
you're a better lover
than you are a maid.

134
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,630
Maid? You son of a bitch.

135
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,900
I'm not a maid, okay?
This is my house, not his.

136
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,510
Sorry.
And what's wrong
with my kitchen?

137
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,350
Nothing. We're sorry.
We're just here
to help Stevie.

138
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,580
Who's Stevie?

139
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,210
Your son?

140
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,050
It was the address you gave.

141
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,650
The ER must have
written it down wrong.

142
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,960
Or you lied because
you don't want us to
talk to your parents.

143
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,520
I gave you their
phone numbers.

144
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,260
You gave us some numbers.
We haven't been able to
reach anyone.

145
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,600
I told you,
they must be in a conference.

146
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,790
He's lying.

147
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,460
Leah.

148
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,530
He's Romany, a Gypsy.

149
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,430
So you don't have a home?

150
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,980
Of course we do.

151
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,020
What, next you're gonna ask me
about dancing around campfires

152
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,710
and stealing children?
This is why
I don't tell people.

153
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,380
They share everything with
each other and nothing with
the <i>gadje,</i> the outsiders.

154
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,900
Sharing information with
outsiders has not gone
so well for my people.

155
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,760
Right now you're making
yourself more vulnerable
by lying to us.

156
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,230
You can't go to my house.
You'll pollute it.

157
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,460
All we're gonna do
is look around.

158
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,100
Your presence is enough.

159
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,510
My parents take it seriously.
It's spiritual as much
as it is physical.

160
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,670
You know where he lives?

161
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,220
Don't.

162
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,180
Look, I'll tell you
whatever you need to know.

163
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,680
If we can't
trust your answers...

164
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,780
I drink sometimes, okay?
I've smoked pot.

165
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,690
I'll tell you anything,
the truth. You just...

166
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,260
You can't go in my home.

167
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,870
The pot wouldn't cause
a bleeding problem.
A pesticide on the pot could.

168
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,870
Where did you get it?

169
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,060
Some kid at school.

170
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,400
Stevie. He got the pot
from me.

171
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,500
He doesn't even go to school.
His parents made him drop out.

172
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,640
I'm home-schooled.
He reads books.

173
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,340
What else are you lying about?
Is your father really
a professor?

174
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,110
He's a salesman.

175
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,520
They buy and sell
anything they can
get their hands on.

176
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,180
They? So you're with your dad
when he's making these deals?

177
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,220
He was just in Chicago
a week ago.

178
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,350
You fly?

179
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,660
No, my dad's got a truck.

180
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,960
You can't be serious.

181
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,440
Actually, I can.

182
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,010
See? It's my space.
I want it back.

183
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,700
It's not your space.
It's the hospital's space,

184
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,810
and the hospital thinks that
the person who's worse off
should get the better space.

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,010
Your application for
a handicap space says
you can walk 50 yards.

186
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,450
And Whitner's says
she can roll 50 miles

187
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,650
between oil changes.
I can't change my leg.

188
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,320
The space I moved you to
is only 46 yards away
from the front door.

189
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,020
I measured. You'll be fine.
Great.

190
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,060
So I can collapse four yards
into the lobby instead of
outside in the cold.

191
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,000
As long as
it's not in my office.
Do you know who won

192
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,100
the New York City Marathon
six years in a row?
Guy in a wheelchair.

193
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,110
Then go get yourself one,
and leave me alone.

194
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,010
Give me my space,
I'll be happy to
roll around all day.

195
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,010
You couldn't last one week
in a wheelchair.

196
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,210
Wanna bet?

197
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,380
What's wrong with you?

198
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,920
Nothing that a week off
my feet won't solve.

199
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,520
Venogram's negative. No leak.

200
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,690
You mean you couldn't
find the leak.

201
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,850
Is your leg worse?

202
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,260
No, my parking spot is.

203
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,730
Blood is only made inside
the circulatory system,

204
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,830
which means when we
find it outside...
There's no leak.

205
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,560
I even checked lymphatics.
So you're gonna spend a week

206
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,130
in a wheelchair just to get
a parking space
closer to the front door?

207
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,730
Easier than chopping off
my legs.

208
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,140
We've ruled out toxins
and drugs.

209
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,040
Kind of. He's Romany.
Apparently, they feel the need
to keep secrets,

210
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,810
so it's hard to know
anything for sure.

211
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,280
Yeah, he's also a human being,

212
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,180
which means
you shouldn't be trusting him
to begin with.

213
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,620
Stop relying on his answers
and find some on your own.

214
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,180
It's a deep-vein thrombosis.

215
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,050
The kid spent 16 hours
in the back seat
of an old pick-up.

216
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,030
Causes a clot,
makes its way to his lungs.

217
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,430
We should do an arteriogram,
find the clot,
bust it with TPA.

218
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,590
Or we can find the leak.

219
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,030
There's no leak.

220
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,500
Hey, you can't yell at a guy
in a wheelchair.

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,400
This is a slow leak.
You've got to speed it up.

222
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,200
Thin his blood.
Redo the venogram.

223
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,770
That could cause
a massive bleed.

224
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,400
Excellent.
Massive will be
even easier to find.

225
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,810
Pardon me. I guess you guys
are gonna have to
get the next one.

226
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,150
I thought you were
redoing the venogram.

227
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,450
As soon as we're done
with the arteriogram.

228
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,020
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little poke.

229
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,360
Can you maybe do that?

230
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,960
Don't worry. It's just
your leg. I don't have to
go any further than this.

231
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,030
Take a look at this,
bones of your forearm.

232
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,100
Radius and ulna.

233
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,570
How about the wrist?

234
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,370
Lunate, hamate, the...

235
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,870
"Scared lovers
try positions
they can't handle."

236
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,820
It's a mnemonic for
the wrist bones. It's the
only way I can remember them.

237
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,060
(GROANING)

238
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,860
FOREMAN: You okay?

239
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,030
My stomach.
Did you hit something?

240
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,870
I barely started.
Lie flat.

241
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,130
No, I can't.
It hurts too much.
I'm getting out.

242
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,800
It's our only chance
to see what's going on.

243
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,340
If he moves,
I could shred his artery.

244
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,500
Get it out now!

245
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,310
It's gonna be okay, Stevie.
Just inject the dye.

246
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,480
Dye's going into his liver,
but it's not coming out.

247
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,890
Clot's gotta be constricting
the flow in the hepatic vein.

248
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,790
It's not constricting it.
It's completely blocking it.
His whole liver's fried.

249
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,160
The kid's liver's failing
because of a massive clot

250
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,040
that's blocking his
hepatic vein. How can he have
both a bleed and a clot?

251
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,740
It's not a clot.
You must have blocked the vein

252
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,800
with a catheter wire.
Not a chance.

253
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,810
Increased pressure downstream
could also stop the blood.

254
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,150
There's no heart failure
or cirrhosis.
Means it has to be a clot.

255
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,710
Massive clots block veins.
They don't make them leak.

256
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,810
And since he clearly
has some kind of...

257
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,950
You having a little problem?

258
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,150
Would you mind?

259
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,030
Boy, that was humiliating.
How does Whitner
make it through the day?

260
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,400
"Pride goeth before the fall."

261
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,840
Lucky for me,
I'm sitting in one
of these babies.

262
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,030
So what other theories
can I shoot down?

263
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,440
DIC would explain both the...

264
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,840
His platelets are normal,
and his PTT isn't elevated.

265
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,540
Leukemia?
Normal CBC, and differential?

266
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,110
You guys are still thinking
like doctors when you should
be thinking like plumbers.

267
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,280
Come on, I wanna see
some butt crack.

268
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,980
Something inside the liver
is punching holes
in the pipes.

269
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,890
Blood bleeds through
the opening, sticks to
the intruder, forms a mass.

270
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,550
A clot.
A mass.

271
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,690
Cancer? A tumor could
erode a blood vessel.

272
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,490
Well, so could a granuloma
from tuberculosis
or sarcoidosis.

273
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,870
Do a CT, MRI,
sputum and ACE level.

274
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,630
Excuse me. Sorry.
Cripple coming through.

275
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,640
He says his throat hurts.

276
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,550
That phrasing means
you think it doesn't.

277
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,020
No, I don't.

278
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,160
Good enough for me.
Where are you going?

279
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,490
Mothers know best.
Get yourself a sucker
on the way out.

280
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,530
Look, I think he's just faking
so he doesn't have to
go to school.

281
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,730
How did you know
I was a truant officer?

282
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,670
I told him he had a choice,
go to school or the doctor.

283
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,760
Right. He's wasting
your precious time,
so you decided to waste mine.

284
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,370
How thoughtful.

285
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,380
I'm in a wheelchair,
so I can't examine him
all the way up there.

286
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,440
Hop down.
My life is just
one horror after another.

287
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,850
Open.

288
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,450
Does it look like it hurts?

289
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,720
No.

290
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,490
What's that?

291
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,540
Syringe. I'm with you.

292
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,570
Make him hate
the doctor's office
more than he hates school.

293
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,570
That's okay.
I don't think that's...

294
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,770
It's just saline.

295
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Hurts like hell
when it's injected directly
into the muscle.

296
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,280
So what do you think,
arm or ass?

297
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,680
I think he's
learned his lesson.

298
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,310
Oh, I don't know.
We better check.

299
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,550
Jack, is your mommy a big,
fat idiot?

300
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,560
Well, what do you know?
I guess you were right.

301
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,600
Just hold still, Stevie.
This shouldn't take long.

302
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,460
Sorry, I'm guessing
the mike in this thing
doesn't pick up nods.

303
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,770
Smart kid.

304
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,430
Too bad it's all
gonna go to waste.

305
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,980
Nothing wrong
with being a salesman.

306
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,640
He should be able to
pursue his own life,

307
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,270
not be stuck
helping his parents
sell old toasters.

308
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,580
He's still young.
You never know what
he'll end up doing.

309
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,050
Unless he goes back to school,
I know exactly
what he'll end up doing.

310
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,650
Wait. A lesion?

311
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,630
CHASE: Magnifying times five.

312
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,060
CAMERON: It's a granuloma.

313
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,990
It means Wegener's
is the most likely.

314
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,720
Stevie!
Mom, is that you?

315
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,000
Get him out of this now.

316
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,230
Your son is sick.
The sign on the door...

317
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,240
The sign says, "No metal."
We took everything off.

318
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,170
It says, "No admittance."

319
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,510
What's wrong with our son?
We don't know yet.

320
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,810
He's not gonna die, is he?

321
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,610
Your son is very ill.
We're still trying to
figure out why,

322
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,350
which is why
we need you to leave the room.

323
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,640
What are you gonna do now?

324
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,670
Oh, now I've got to
slide my butt from
one padded seat to another.

325
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,710
What if I bump my knee?

326
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,110
MRI showed
a granuloma in his liver.

327
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,620
Fantastic.

328
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,820
Wanna give me a hand here?
No.

329
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,260
Clotting, bleeding
and a granuloma
equals Wegener's.

330
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,260
I know.
That's why I said fantastic.
I was being sincere.

331
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,300
Now, give me a hand.
Wouldn't be fair.

332
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,090
We're gonna biopsy
the liver to confirm.

333
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,500
Wouldn't be fair not to.

334
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,330
People are good and kind
and gentle and help people
in wheelchairs.

335
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
You don't believe that.
But you do.

336
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,630
No, I don't.

337
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,970
Foreman, forget the biopsy.

338
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,770
His liver will be gone
before you get the results.

339
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,370
Start treatment
with cyclophosphamide

340
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,350
before the Wegener's
punches a hole
in another pipe.

341
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,270
What's with the clothes?
You're not being discharged.

342
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,080
I know.

343
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,370
It's my parents.
They insist that I wear
this stuff.

344
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,250
We insist on our on food,
gown and furnishings
for a reason.

345
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,260
Hey, my chest burns.
Are you sure the treatments
are working?

346
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,560
Wegener's causes the body
to attack itself.

347
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,890
That doesn't get undone
overnight. Be patient.

348
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,060
Where's your soup?

349
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,500
It's in the garbage.

350
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,130
It has willow-bark extract.

351
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,830
Willow-bark extract
is basically aspirin.

352
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,460
Yes, for the fever.

353
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,560
He's already on meds,
our meds.

354
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,370
We can't risk any
adverse interactions.

355
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,640
We need all this stuff to go.
We need to control
this environment.

356
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,380
So do we. People get sick
for a reason,

357
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,040
'cause something in their life
is out of balance.

358
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,280
Dad, he's a doctor.
He doesn't want to
hear your talk.

359
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,350
Balance is just starting
to be restored
now that that girl is gone.

360
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,760
That girl took pretty good
care of your son
while you were away.

361
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,760
Yes, we can see that.

362
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,590
Look, all this stuff may make
him feel more comfortable,
but it's not gonna...

363
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,000
How long is this treatment
gonna take?

364
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,500
We should start to see
some improvement

365
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,930
in his liver function soon.

366
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,230
Soon. Very scientific.

367
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,270
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,350
I'll be back in a little bit
to check on you.

369
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,830
Ah, yes, if it isn't
Dr. Ironside.

370
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,990
Ah, if it isn't
Dr. "I Had No Friends
When I Was Growing Up,

371
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,930
"So All I Did Was Watch TV

That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

375
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,900
(EXCLAIMS)

376
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,970
Safe from Cuddy,
but I guess not from
her trusted rat-complice.

377
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,480
Reasonable people don't debate
the relative merits
of their handicaps.

378
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,450
Reasonable people
make rules based on evidence,

379
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,710
like difficulty
covering a distance,

380
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,590
say, 50 yards, not on
some preordained
patheticness scale.

381
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,560
Last I checked, pigheadedness
was not the eighth
heavenly virtue.

382
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,890
It's only pigheaded
if you're wrong.
If you're right,

383
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,860
they call it,
"Sticking to your principles."

384
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,490
Give it up.
You're demeaning yourself.

385
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,260
That's what they told
Rosa Parks.

386
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,070
Don't stand up in there.
I'm watching your feet.

387
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,430
Get out of our home.

388
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,770
This is not a home.

389
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,830
It's certainly not...

390
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,240
It's our home as long as
our son is here.

391
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,410
Mom, Dad, will you please
just calm down.

392
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,680
You're not family.
You have no right to be here.

393
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,380
What are you gonna do?
Throw me out? You can't
even touch the <i>gadje.</i>

394
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,420
I'll touch you.
What is going on?

395
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,290
I'm the one who brought
him here. I should be
able to see how he's doing.

396
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,450
He wouldn't even need
to be here
if it weren't for you.

397
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,430
Right. I'm so unclean,
I caused his liver
to shut down.

398
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,490
Enough. No one is leaving.

399
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,590
He's our son,
and we want her out of here.

400
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,130
(GROANING)

401
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,630
It hurts.
It's your stomach again?

402
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,330
No.
What?

403
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,510
FOREMAN: His liver's
actually improving.

404
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,950
We plug one hole
and end up poking another.

405
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,490
Are we talking about
the patient or how to
get a raise from Cuddy?

406
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,530
The Wegener's treatment
gave him a massive hemorrhage
in his bladder.

407
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,030
Which means it's Wegener's.

408
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,290
What did I just say?

409
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,530
We were treating him
for Wegener's when
everything went wrong.

410
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,660
Not everything.

411
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,230
Yeah, it was a very
lovely day outside.

412
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,740
On the other hand,
the treatment made him worse.

413
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,900
Treatment made his
bladder worse, not his liver.

414
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,370
Clot in the liver's
breaking up.

415
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,810
And MRI, sputum and ACE
ruled out TB,
sarcoidosis and lymphoma,

416
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,250
which leaves us with...

417
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,510
Still could be
a cancer with multiple...

418
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,710
A cancer we can't see
on MRI, CT or blood tests?

419
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,090
It's Wegener's.

420
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,820
It's not the wrong diagnosis.
It's the wrong treatment.

421
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,290
We could increase
immunosuppression.
Add methotrexate.

422
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,850
We can't give methotrexate
to a kid who's already
had lung problems.

423
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,660
Methotrexate is
carpet bombing.
Hits everything.

424
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,800
We need a smart bomb.

425
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,240
We don't suppress
the immune system.
We change it.

426
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,780
Immune modulation. FT28.
His antibodies are
attacking his blood vessels.

427
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,250
The irritation causes it
to bleed and clot.
We change his immune system

428
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,480
<i>so the antibodies</i>
<i>don't interact</i>
<i>with his blood vessels</i>

429
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,150
but work fine
everywhere else.

430
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,120
FT28 is still experimental.
It's not FDA approved.

431
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,790
It's worked for
Crohn's disease
and rheumatoid arthritis.

432
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,490
He doesn't have Crohn's
or arthritis.

433
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,970
Let's say that he does
and start the treatment.

434
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,700
Absolutely not.

435
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,340
My people have been
experimented on before.
Never again.

436
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,880
Mister Lipa,
with all due respect,

437
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,350
comparing this hospital
with Auschwitz,
it's ridiculous.

438
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,680
FT28 has been proven
safe in hundreds...

439
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,310
People always say
you can trust them.

440
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,550
Why would they
say anything else?

441
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,180
Why do they think
we would listen?

442
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,490
You think I don't understand
what it's like to come
from a people

443
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,690
who've been enslaved,
mistreated
and experimented on?

444
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,700
Tuskegee went on
for 28 years
after World War II.

445
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,260
And the laws that made it
illegal for the Romany
to even set foot

446
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,530
in this state were still
on the books until 1998.
It's not ancient history.

447
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,480
Conventional therapy
hasn't worked.
Your son may be dying.

448
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,310
He needs a targeted approach,
and you need to trust us.

449
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm sorry. A lifetime
of experiences tells me
I can't trust you,

450
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,460
and the past three days
have done nothing
to change that.

451
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,260
We want our son treated,
not experimented on.

452
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,360
If you don't know how to
do that, then just tell us,

453
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,920
so we can take him
someplace where they do.

454
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,900
They're absolutely right.
Stay away

455
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,100
from that unproven,
experimental stuff.
Much better to stick

456
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,370
with the "moving the furniture
until he gets better"
approach.

457
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,670
Yes, you're right.
We're gonna have to come up
with something else.

458
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,010
Do you mean another
last-ditch, desperation move?
You got anything?

459
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Go back and don't take no
for an answer. What kind of
salesman are you?

460
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,210
The kind who avoids the house
with the crazy couple

461
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,520
who put tin foil
over their windows.

462
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,790
They got money for tin foil,

463
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,350
they got money for
whatever you're selling.

464
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,990
What's that mean?

465
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,860
It means that if they don't
trust you, you should
earn that lack of trust.

466
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,990
What does paying
for tinfoil mean?

467
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,730
Why should I have
to answer all the questions?

468
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,260
Oops.

469
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,840
Sorry. Still getting used to
the power steering.

470
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,270
I assume you've
heard the news?

471
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,470
I'm not worried.

472
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,640
From what I hear,
what you lack in shame,
you also lack in willpower.

473
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,050
My will may be weak,
but my backbone is strong

474
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,890
and pain-free
now that I've stopped
using the cane.

475
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,260
Of course,
it's harder to look down
Cuddy's shirt,

476
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,590
but then the vantage point
on her ass has much improved.

477
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,030
Then that's just me,
always looking
on the bright side.

478
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,330
I'm the guy who said
that her C-cups are half full.

479
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,930
They are nice, aren't they?

480
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:58,830
Oh, no, no, no,
you're not gonna win me
over that easily.

481
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,380
You may have a wheel.
It doesn't mean you get
the grease.

482
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,250
You gotta squeak.

483
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,460
What's that?

484
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,000
It's cyclophosphamide.

485
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,600
We're continuing
the standard treatment
as you requested.

486
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,340
I have to ask everyone
to leave the room
for a few minutes

487
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,610
while I apply some bandages.

488
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,440
Why do we have to leave?

489
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,680
They're for his penis.

490
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,100
You lied to them.
The bleeding's stopped.
I don't need any bandages.

491
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,980
I need to change
your treatment,

492
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
but your parents won't let us.
They've got it in their minds

493
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,140
that we want to try some sort
of inhuman experiment on you.

494
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,840
The treatment's experimental?

495
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,480
FT28 has been
through extensive
clinical trials.

496
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,520
It's also been used
successfully
for other conditions.

497
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,220
The fact that you're
recommending
experimental treatment

498
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,690
means you have
no other options.

499
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,560
Sorry. We stop
the pleural effusions,
your liver almost fails.

500
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,530
We save your liver,
the bladder fails.

501
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,930
If we don't get ahead
of the curve on this...

502
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,100
What do you need me to do?

503
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,370
Take the medicine,
but don't tell your parents.

504
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,850
I don't like lying
to my parents.

505
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,210
The rest of the world,
though...

506
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,840
The rest of the world
I can't trust.

507
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,540
You can trust me.

508
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,920
How do I know?

509
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,950
Because if you do this,
then tell your parents,
I lose my license.

510
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,640
(GROANS)

511
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,070
God.
Get in here.

512
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,780
Wow, his spleen
basically exploded, huh?

513
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,620
Got another bleeder.
2-O silk on a stick.

514
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,660
Got it.

515
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,360
I believe you ordered
your meat rare.

516
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,770
Keep him open.
If I confirm Wegener's,

517
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,830
might as well stage
the disease while he's
still on the table.

518
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,210
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

519
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,580
External capsule's
ruptured but still intact.

520
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,220
No signs of a clot or a bleed.
Normal follicles,
normal lymphoid tissue.

521
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,520
<i>His spleen is ripped</i>
<i>to shreds. There's gotta be</i>
<i>granulomas. Keep looking.</i>

522
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,220
Come on,
can't leave Humpty Dumpty
like this forever.

523
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,600
I don't see anything
but normal spleen.
No granulomas.

524
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,190
Means no Wegener's.

525
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,430
That's all I need to know.
Let's go people.

526
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,770
<i>Run his bowel.</i>

527
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,740
No need. I'm closing.

528
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,240
Suture.

529
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,170
Run his bowel.

530
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,240
Nothing suspicious
in the spleen.

531
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,800
Get him out of here.

532
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,140
You missed it.

533
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,210
He had a granuloma
in his liver.

534
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,310
No, it was just scar tissue.

535
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,650
Looks like a granuloma
on the MRI, but it's not.

536
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,680
I don't know why I'm debating
this. Pass me the
Kelly clamp. I'm closing.

537
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,700
Not unless you're gonna sew
my hand into
this kid's stomach.

538
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,230
Get out of there.
He's unstable.

539
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,000
He's got Wegener's,
which means he's got
granulomas.

540
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,230
I'm calling my lawyer.

541
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,430
It's only 26 feet.

542
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,370
If you were an ostrich,
you'd have a 46-foot wait.

543
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,040
(BEEPING)

544
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,600
Blood pressure's dropping.

545
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,150
Hang another bag
of Ringer's lactate.

546
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,550
I'm having nothing
to do with this.

547
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,280
Foreman, hang another bag...

548
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,150
Ringer's lactate. Got it.

549
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,630
Come on. Come on.
It's gotta be in here.
It's gotta be in here.

550
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,910
It's not.

551
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,780
Mind if we close?

552
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,430
It's a good thing we never
sold him on FT28.
His parents were right.

553
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,360
There's no way his parents
are gonna let us
near him again.

554
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,000
They won't be able to
transfer him until he's
recovered from the surgery.

555
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,310
You can add the surgical team
to the list of people who
won't let us near him.

556
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,840
Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots,
spleen explodes.

557
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,350
We should test for
Von Willebrand's.

558
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,450
Or just play tic-tac-toe.

559
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,960
Okay, X's are bleeds.
O's are clots.

560
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,290
We started in the lungs,
right? What did we do?

561
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,730
CT, sputum, two venograms.

562
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,820
It's one bleed, one clot,
then what?

563
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,460
Liver shut down, MRI, labs,
treated with cyclophophamide.

564
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,800
Whereupon he peed out
three units of O-negative,
another bleed.

565
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,900
Where is this going?
I don't know yet.

566
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,640
What's next?
Bladder, kidneys.

567
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,340
High-resolution CT scan,
UA and urine sediment.

568
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,510
GI tract?

569
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,950
You ran his small bowel
in the OR.

570
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,250
The large bowel's fixed
to the abdominal wall.

571
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,980
I didn't run that.
Because there was
no reason to.

572
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,020
He hasn't been having
any symptoms in his bowels.

573
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,560
Do a colonoscopy.

574
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,150
Because he's had no symptoms?

575
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,090
You lose your keys,
the first thing you do
is look everywhere

576
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,720
you might logically
have placed them.

577
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,160
When you don't find them,
then you start looking
in other places.

578
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,670
The medicine cabinet, freezer,
mailbox. We need to look
in this kid's mailbox.

579
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,040
Why don't we x-ray his feet?
They're fine, too.

580
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,240
Because we need to take
the center square to block.

581
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,510
Okay, even if that did
make sense, it's kind of hard
to do a colonoscopy

582
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,710
on a kid you can't get near.

583
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,410
He's in the ICU now.

584
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,350
His parent's only have
limited visiting privileges.

585
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,260
I like that kid.
He's got spunk.

586
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,170
Can't talk now. On guard duty.

587
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,410
You're still in that thing?

588
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,640
What thing?

589
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,780
Oh, this?
Forgot it was even there.

590
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,880
You know, even if you manage
not to get struck down
by a bolt of lightning,

591
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,820
and make it a week,
Cuddy's not gonna give you
the space.

592
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,880
She can't.

593
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,980
A bet's a bet.

594
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,550
Yes, and that rule outranks
the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

595
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,900
You think you've got logic
on your side, but Whitner's
got the legal system,

596
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,590
and legal beats logic
every time. Just ask OJ.

597
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,230
You're right.

598
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,110
I am?
Yeah.

599
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,910
So you're doing this even
though you know you've got
no legal leg to stand on?

600
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,780
Who needs legs when
you got wheels?
I'm gonna get that spot.

601
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,770
No way Cuddy is going to
gyp me.

602
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,050
What did you say?

603
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,350
I'll see you later.

604
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,650
Gonna have them
yelling at me
for the next 20 minutes.

605
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,250
Mucosa looks normal, healthy.
No lonely diverticula.

606
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,800
Blood pressure's dropping.
He's bleeding again.

607
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,530
CHASE: I'm in his colon.

608
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,270
Hurry up.
I am.

609
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,630
There's nothing there.

610
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,680
Wait. Wait. What's that?

611
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,440
A reflection?

612
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,380
No, it's something.

613
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,120
Looks like a...

614
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,680
Toothpick.

615
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,980
Are you sure?

616
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,830
He must have swallowed it
accidentally and just figured
he'd digest it eventually.

617
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,530
When you two were making
out in the car, he must have
folded awkwardly,

618
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,470
<i>pushed the toothpick through</i>
<i>the wall of the intestine</i>
<i>and into the lung.</i>

619
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,660
Then it moved on to his liver
and made its way
to his bladder and spleen.

620
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,260
So that's it?
He's gonna be okay?

621
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, small holes.

622
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,340
It shouldn't take that long
to heal now that
we've got it out.

623
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,010
See? See what you did?
Me?

624
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,240
If you hadn't been
kissing him...

625
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,880
That's what you heard?

626
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,510
It was the toothpick.
It was that disgusting
habit that you...

627
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:05,350
It would have just passed
right through him if he
hadn't been writhing around.

628
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,190
Isn't that right...

629
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,760
That's it?

630
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,860
Yeah, that's it.

631
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,300
Wood absorbs water,
becomes the same density
as the tissue around it.

632
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:21,570
That's why
it didn't show up
on the CT or MRI.

633
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,170
That's cool.

634
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,640
I mean, not cool for me,

635
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,770
but a lot of damage
for something so small.

636
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,320
You know, the lab here,
they have a paid intern
position.

637
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,620
It's usually given to
one of the kids
from the universities,

638
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,390
but if you want,
I could probably get you
an interview.

639
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,090
You know, some entry-level
stuff, some gopher work,

640
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,430
but you'd also have access
to a lot of cool things.

641
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,370
Thanks, really, but I can't.

642
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,340
Yes, you can.
Stevie, you're bright.

643
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,680
You have more curiosity
than 90% of the doctors
on this staff.

644
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,210
No, it's not that.
It's just...

645
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,160
I go to work every day
with my family, you know?

646
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,260
People I've known
my whole life.

647
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,330
I don't want to lose that.

648
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,330
You can have both.

649
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,430
No, I can't.

650
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,600
Because they don't
want to let you.

651
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,200
They shouldn't be
making you choose.

652
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,680
Maybe not, but they are.

653
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm choosing them.

654
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,150
Change is hard.
Trust me, I know.

655
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,060
But it worked out for me.

656
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,320
You're a successful doctor.

657
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,900
Your name is on
journal articles.
I would love that.

658
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,870
It's just I see you
with Doctors Chase
and Cameron,

659
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,570
and you all got
empty ring fingers.

660
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,610
You're alone.

661
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,300
(LAUGHS)

662
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,330
This is my last day
living a life of leisure.

663
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,430
So are you gonna
tell Doctor Whitner
she's out of my space,

664
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,270
or can I?
Why would I do that?

665
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,210
Because you said that
you would, and lying is wrong.

666
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,310
I said I would give you
the space if you made it
a whole week...

667
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,220
Which I...
Didn't.

668
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,520
The bet didn't stipulate
that you had to be
in the chair for a week

669
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,080
unless you had to barge
into an operating room

670
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,250
and shove your hands
in a kid's bowels.

671
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,850
You know about that?

672
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,100
You lost.

673
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,900
I saved a life.

674
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,030
Two minutes
out of the chair
to save a kid's life.

675
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,300
You lost, House.

676
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,140
I earned that space.

677
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,770
No, you didn't.

678
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,610
I earn that space every day
I limp into that building
and do my damn job.

679
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,580
You lost.

680
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,770
Hey!

681
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,760
You were never gonna give me
that space, were you?
I saw Whitner the other day.

682
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,230
She knew about the bet,
didn't seem that worried.

683
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,660
She knew I'd win.

684
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,530
She doesn't know me.

685
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,500
In fact,
she doesn't know anything,
except what you tell her.

686
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,130
You told her that you
were never gonna give me
that space, didn't you?

687
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,940
Just tell me,
do you at least feel
a little guilty?

688
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,010
You wanna teach me lessons,
don't make commitments
you can't keep.

689
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,760
How's it going?

690
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,820
How guilty does she look?

691
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,160
About an eight.

692
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,830
That space is mine.
<i>Vini, vidi, vinci.</i>

693
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,710
