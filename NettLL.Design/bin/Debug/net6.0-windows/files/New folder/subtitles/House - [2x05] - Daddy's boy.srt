00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,794
Nothing. I mean,
why would you think
she was sick?

168
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,962
We think it may have been
what caused her car accident.

169
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,833
Wait, what do you mean?
My mom's car was hit
by a drunk driver.

170
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,502
That's not what
the police report indicated.

171
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,637
Well, you must have gotten
the wrong report.

172
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,179
No. They didn't.

173
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,115
(SlGHS)

174
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,317
When you started driving...

175
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,918
I...

176
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,427
You lied about how Mom died?

177
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,898
KEN: I figured if her death
could somehow mean something,
it...

178
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,333
How does lying about it
mean something?

179
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,330
How could you use her
like that, Dad? Her death?

180
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,500
I was just trying
to protect you.
What else isn't true?

181
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,771
She wasn't a teacher,
you just wanted me to read?

182
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,243
What's that smell?

183
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,906
I don't smell...

184
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,578
We're gonna need a nurse.

185
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,623
What the hell?
It's okay.
We'll take care of it.

186
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,452
You didn't feel anything?

187
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,949
No.

188
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,522
You feel that?
Yeah.

189
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,032
But you didn't feel
any of this?

190
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,456
No.

191
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,013
Sphincter paralysis
plus shocks equals
Miller Fisher Syndrome.

192
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,414
Not if you add
the stool sample,

193
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,883
which is negative
for C. jejuni.

194
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,819
He lied to his son
about how his mom died?

195
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,884
CAMERON: He was just
protecting him.

196
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,151
Manipulating him.

197
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,055
That's what parents do.
They lie to us
because they love us.

198
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,322
Who's getting teary?

199
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,727
Mom's death is irrelevant.

200
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,594
DNA revealed no NF2 markers

201
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,224
or any other
inherited disease.

202
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,997
Apparently, she really did
fall asleep at the wheel.

203
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,630
So, what exactly
are we talking about here?

204
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,608
A little peeker,
or did the prairie dog
actually come out to play?

205
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,145
Excuse me?
Are we talking explosive?

206
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,414
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
The hemoccult
was negative for blood,

207
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,250
and I wouldn't say
he actually exploded.
More like gushed?

208
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,614
Good, then we're
getting somewhere.

209
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,850
Yeah? Where?

210
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,652
I have no idea.

211
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,984
Of course.
Hello?

212
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,222
Love the riddles.
Hi, Mom.

213
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,366
Look, I have a business
dinner on Thursday night.
I can't get out of it.

214
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,902
I know, I really
wanted to see you, too.

215
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,874
Actually, can I call you back?
I'm in a meeting right now.

216
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,273
Okay, thanks.

217
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,237
Who was that?

218
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,644
Angelina Jolie.

219
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,578
I call her "Mom."
Who thinks that's sexy?

220
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,243
So, explosive or gushing...

221
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,481
She never calls here,
is everything okay?

222
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,423
Great, yeah.

223
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,987
My dad's taking her to Europe.

224
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,462
They got a nine-hour layover
in Newark on Thursday.

225
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,967
If it's gastrointestinal...
You lied to avoid
seeing your own mom.

226
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,764
Are you kidding?
I can't lie to my mom.

227
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,668
Seriously, I can't.

228
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,138
Wilson's invited me to dinner.

229
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,675
It'd be rude to stand up a guy
who just loaned me 5 grand.

230
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,506
Transverse myelitis.

231
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,078
Could cause numbness,
anal sphincter dysfunction,

232
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,171
and the shocks.

233
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,944
Thank you for taking
no interest in my mother.

234
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,382
But that begs the question,

235
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,614
what caused
the transverse myelitis?

236
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,122
Well, we've ruled out
cancer and MS.

237
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,351
Leaves infection.

238
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,949
If there was infection,
there'd be a fever.

239
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,927
And his blood and CSF cultures
are all negative.

240
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,192
Maybe the infection's gone
but the memory remains.

241
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,456
Molecular mimicry.

242
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,757
Nice.

243
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,805
Okay,
get an immunoglobulin level
and electrophoresis.

244
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,372
You're good, my friend.
I'm sure we'll meet again.

245
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,910
Do you really think
that was his mom on the phone?

246
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,544
Probably, don't know
why he'd lie about that.

247
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,744
Who cares?

248
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,415
You're not
the least bit curious
what his parents are like?

249
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,856
I'm sure his mom's
a piece of work.

250
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,620
Only a mother
could do that much damage.

251
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,423
My bet's he was born
the way he is.

252
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,726
Probably
tormented his parents,
not the other way around.

253
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,323
Yeah, he was
either a fast runner
or one hell of a fighter.

254
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,163
Where are you going?

255
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,700
You guys can handle
the tests, right?

256
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,177
Is there something important
that you and House need
to discuss over dinner?

257
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,113
Other than
the skyrocketing

258
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,048
interest rates
on personal loans?

259
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,882
You know,
this is the fourth time
I've loaned him money.

260
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,047
Not lunch money, money-money.

261
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,215
House's parents.

262
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,349
They have a layover
in Newark Thursday evening.

263
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,459
I'm canceling dinner.
No.

264
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,995
I thought maybe
you could just invite
a few more people.

265
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,635
FOREMAN:
An infectious agent's
molecular structure

266
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,367
can resemble
the spinal cord's.

267
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,375
And when the immune system
attacks the infection,

268
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,071
it ends up attacking
the spinal cord's as well.

269
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,806
So he has an infection?

270
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:36,973
They just said I don't.

271
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,711
Even after
the infection is gone,
it goes right on attacking

272
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,116
because the spinal cord
is still there.

273
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,211
KEN: Is there a treatment?

274
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,449
Depends on what
the original infection was.

275
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,455
All right, you're done.

276
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,051
You need to lay flat
after a lumbar puncture
for about an hour.

277
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,096
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

278
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,563
Hey, Dad, can you get me
a Coke, please?

279
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,623
Yeah, that usually helps.

280
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,602
You're done.

281
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,033
If you're nauseous...

282
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,666
No, I'm not nauseous.
I just want him out of here.

283
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,370
He's your dad.
He's gonna be around.

284
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,977
Yeah, I know.

285
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,914
It's not that, it's...

286
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,448
Are these people
completely incapable

287
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,885
of telling the truth
to each other?

288
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,287
He went to Jamaica
with his friends.

289
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,721
No wonder he lied.

290
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,018
Children aren't supposed
to have good times.

291
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,925
One of his friends
flew them down.

292
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,124
Carnell's dad has this thing
about him accepting stuff
from rich friends.

293
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,259
He wants him to
remember who he is,
where he came from.

294
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,462
Where have you been?

295
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,097
Making dinner plans.
What's up?

296
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,334
The boys have uncovered
the shocking fact

297
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,400
that the patient has
a crappy relationship
with his dad.

298
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,571
They seem to actually care.
Well, I don't.

299
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,138
There's only one reason
any kid with a plane
flies to Jamaica.

300
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,582
It wasn't for marijuana.
He doesn't do anything
but drink.

301
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,017
He said that to you
or his pops?

302
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,112
Tox screen was negative
for THC.

303
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,623
Spring break was over
a month ago.

304
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,022
Even pot would have
washed out by now.

305
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,458
Even if he'd smoked,

306
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,018
no way marijuana
causes transverse myelitis.

307
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,827
True. But the stuff
they put on it does.

308
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,292
Pesticides.

309
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,462
Well, why would he
come clean about the trip
but lie about smoking pot?

310
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,165
He wouldn't
necessarily have to smoke
to get pesticide poisoning.

311
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,174
He could have eaten fruit
that'd been sprayed,

312
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,301
or been exposed
through his skin on a hike.

313
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,006
Or he could have smoked it.
A lot of it.

314
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,640
Then lied about it
because that's what
this family does.

315
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,116
Start him on lv pralidoxime.
Two grams per liter,

316
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,983
and then one gram
every eight hours until
you see some improvement.

317
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,888
You have no evidence
to support
a poisoning diagnosis.

318
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,416
Which is why
it's gonna be so cool
when I turn out to be right.

319
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,392
Cameron.

320
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,195
Who are you making
dinner plans with?

321
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,693
No one.

322
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,307
HOUSE: You bastard.

323
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,778
You invited my parents
to dinner.

324
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,973
Cameron's got a big mouth.

325
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,109
Not as big as yours.

326
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,279
Hey! You used me
to avoid seeing your parents.

327
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,549
Well, what do you care?
I don't.

328
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,648
I just thought
it might be interesting
to find out why.

329
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,216
You could've just asked.
You would've lied.

330
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,055
And you would've believed me.

331
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,687
Which would've kept us
both happy.

332
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,631
You want your money back?
Is that what this is about?

333
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,760
No!

334
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,633
Wait, have you got the money?

335
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,113
If you have the money,
then why did you need
the loan?

I just wanted to see
if you'd give it to me.

I've been borrowing
increasing amounts

338
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,712
ever since you lent me
$40 a year ago.

339
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,246
A little experiment,

340
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,256
to see
where you draw the line.

341
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,418
You're trying
to objectively measure

342
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,555
how much
I value our friendship?

343
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,428
Hey, it's 5 grand.
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

344
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,562
So, what do you say?
One little phone call,
one big check?

345
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,100
Fine.

346
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,871
Thanks.

348
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,944

tell Mommy and Daddy
you don't wanna see them,

00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,541

at 7:00 for dinner.

What do you mean?
You just said that...
I lied.

I've been lying to you
in increasing amounts

00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,483
ever since I told you
you looked good unshaved
a year ago.

353
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,221
It's a little experiment,
you know,

354

where you draw the line.

357
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,370
Haven't been in yet, today.

358
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,771
As long as he hasn't gotten
any worse.

for pesticide poisoning

of pesticides.

00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,975
I'm gonna have
a hell of a time

362
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,481
explaining that
to our lawyer.

363
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,574
I told House not to...

364
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,313
Wow.

365
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,157
Lawyer's not gonna
believe this.

366
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,621
He's got his appetite back.

Whatever you did,
it's working.

368
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,191
He's healthy,
so all is forgiven.

He is not healthy.

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,800
Nausea and diarrhea
were not his only symptoms.

372
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,271
The shocks
have also decreased.

373
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,739
But not disappeared.

374

375
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,305

for everyone.

and his temperature's spiking.

The truth is I have no idea.

397
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,972
There's the fever
that Cameron was looking for.

398
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,234
We knew if it was myelitis,
there had to be an "-itis."

00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,776
This must be the infection
that set it off.
Yeah.

effect follows cause.

but...

402
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,808
Maybe the tests were wrong.

403
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,080
No. The tests were right.
Yesterday he had no fever,
no infection.

404
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,417
So he just happened
to catch a bug
while he was here?

405
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,512
That's all this is?

406
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,521
Yeah.

407
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,058
Because his white blood cell
count was down,
he was vulnerable.

408
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,459
Because it's really down,
it might kill him.
That's all this is.

409
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,293
Is he still pooping his pants?

412
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,729
It stopped
when he was getting better.

413
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,030
When he was feeling better.
He was never getting better.

414
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,474

what causes a 22-year-old kid

to become immunocompromised

00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,773

and shocks?

Just stop and start
for no apparent reason.

418
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,808
And we need
to find an answer

419
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,180
before this infection
kills him.

420
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,912

You. Intravenous
broad spectrum antibiotics.

and lumbar T2-weighted

all those Richie Rich's

424

see if any of them
have got the shocks,
the trots or the hots.

425
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,998
The hots, it's the fever.

You're not curious?

429
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,474
I'm curious about crocs,
but I don't stick my head
in their mouths.

no DNA mutation.

You're gonna have
one dinner with two people.

433
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,981
Sixty minutes,
most of it spent chewing
or talking about the weather.

434
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,457
Unless they say
something like,

435
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,460
"Do you prefer
the chardonnay
or the merlot?"

436
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,258
and, "Oh, we kept Greg
locked in a closet
for 17 years."

437
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,764
You're not gonna
learn anything.

438
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,055
Okay.

439
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,468
CAMERON: We'd like to talk
to some of your friends,

440
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,231
see if they have
any similar symptoms.

441
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,704
The doctors in the ER
already asked me that.

442
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,865
We understand,

443
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,205
but they didn't have
all the information
that we have now.

444
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,006
What kind of information?

445
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,679
Would you mind
if I spoke with Carnell
alone for a minute?

446
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,879
Is this bad news?

447
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,853
No. It's just confidential.

448
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,356
Why is something
suddenly confidential?

449
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,325
I mean, if you know
something about my son,

450
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,725
I need to know
what's going on.

451
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,286
I'm sorry, I have to insist.

452
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,491
I'm his father,

453
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,367
and if I'm going
to take care of him,
I need to know the truth.

454
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,527
Dad.

455
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,966
She wants to know
who I went to Jamaica with.

456
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,867
You've never been
to Jamaica.

457
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,969
Taddy's dad flew
a bunch of us down
over spring break.

458
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,043
You told me you had
two papers to write
over the break.

459
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,555
'Cause I didn't
want to come home
and work my ass off.

460
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:34,155
I wanted an actual break
during a break for once.

461
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,894
I shouldn't have lied to you.

462
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,262
No, what you should have done
is come home

463
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,767
instead of partying
with your rich friends.

464
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,133

00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,205
What do you want?

466
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,276
To apologize.

467
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,245
I realize that
my attention to the clinic
has been somewhat lax of late,

468
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,286
and I wanna make amends.

469
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,751
How about tomorrow night?
I take the night shift.

470
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,449
The clinic's closed at night.

471
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,152
Yeah, but I'm sure
there's plenty of things
to be done,

472
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,751
there's charts to be reviewed,
supplies inventoried...

473
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,421
Dinners avoided.

474
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,753
You're going, too?

475
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,424
I love their Cobb Salad.

476
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,869
Give me a reason
to get out of this,

477
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,564
and I'll tell you
who started the rumor

478
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,573
about you
being a transsexual.

479
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,176
There is no such rumor.
There will be,

480
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,938
unless you get me
out of this dinner.

481
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,502
No one's making you
do this, House.

482
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,104
Just do what
everybody else does.

483
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,308
Lie to them.

484
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,509
You lie to your mother?

485
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,017
Only since I was 1 2!

486
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,247
My mom's a human polygraph.

487
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,653
My dad should be
taking her to vegas,
not the Louvre.

would much rather think

489
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,920
you have a business meeting
than you hate her.

490
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,062
I don't hate her.
I hate him.

491
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,397
TADDY: We all had headaches,
nausea, vomiting.

492
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,961
You know,
we figured it was connected

493
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,836
to the massive amounts
of drinking.

494
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,738
What, you think
what happened to Carnell

495
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:58,901
has something
to do with the trip?

496
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,137
Don't know.

497
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,702
You haven't had
any unexplained pain

498
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,270
or strange feelings
since you got back?

499
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,146
No, except for a little
athlete's foot, I'm fine.

500
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,908
Can I see it?

501
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,180
See what?
Your feet.

502
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,816
There's a common parasite
in Jamaica

503
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,224
that can resemble
foot fungus.

504
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,390
It's not really my feet.

505
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,562
You know,
I figured fungus is fungus.

506
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,631
It's my groin.

507
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,373
I'm going to need
to take a look at that.

508
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,797
Now?

509
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,876
Unless you wanna come down
to the hospital with me.

510
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,878
No, no, I can't. I mean,
I just started two days ago.

511
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,538
We're right in the middle
of a big merger...

512
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,139
Then drop your pants.

513
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,459
Reilly, I need the...
What the hell's going on here?

514
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,659
She's a doctor.

515
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,829
I'm a doctor,
he has a rash,
and a friend of his is...

516
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,567
Right. Well, as soon as
she's done treating your rash,

517
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,074
I need the numbers
on D-Port Technology.

518
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,268
Yes, sir.

519
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,972
And, Doctor,
why don't you leave
a card on your way out?

520
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,817
Except for one guy
with a rash,

521
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,949
no one else on the trip
has any health issues.

522
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,050
What kind of rash?

523
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,651
I don't know,
I took some scrapings,

524
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,320
it doesn't
appear to be ringworm.

525
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,230
What did it look like,
aside from "not ringworm"?

526
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,824
Basically like diaper rash.

527
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,129
He's been working
around the clock,

528
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,194
he said he hasn't changed
his clothes in three days.

529
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,136
Kaposi's Sarcoma
can look like diaper rash.

530
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,799
Any discoloration
around the edges?

531
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,900
Get him in here.
We all wanna take a look.

532
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,002
Even if it is Kaposi's,
it's not related.

533
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,512
Our patient doesn't
have any skin symptoms

534
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,105
and we've already
ruled out cancer.

535
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,877
What are the odds
of two friends

536
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,816
who just
returned from a trip
outside the country

537
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,377
coming down with unexplained
but unrelated illnesses?

538
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,854
Get him in here.
CAMERON: He won't come.

539
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,356
Just started a new job
after graduation,

540
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,790
they're working
on some big merger.

541
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,691
Tell him his friend's life
hangs in the balance.

542
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,592
That's what I told him
the first time.

543
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,961
Still wound up
driving into Manhattan.

544
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,563
Tell him his life
hangs in the balance.

545
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,364
Tell him the rash
is flesh-eating,

546
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,565
and the next
course on the menu
is his frank and beans.

547
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,734
Where's Stacy?

548
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,603
Speaking at a conference
in Baltimore.
Why, what do you need?

549
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,909
Can I subpoena a patient?

550
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,213
House wants me
to lie to the kid
to get him in here.

551
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,310
Well, then you'll be the one
getting the subpoena.

552
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,821
Well, we do need him
to diagnose his friend.

553
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,118
Take the test to the kid.

554
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,682
There is no test,
House just wants
to look at it.

555
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,387
Then take House to it.

556
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,123
Yeah,
like that's gonna happen.

557
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,862
Tell House his parents called.

558
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,458
Said they were
coming in early.

559
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,902
He'll go anywhere
just to avoid them.

560
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,406
So, it's okay to lie to House
but not to a patient?

561
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,603
Yup.

It's rigid!

He's bleeding
into his abdomen!

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,684
CAMERON: What's going on?

567
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,628
We need a surgeon
and an OR, stat!
On it.

568
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,932
Try to hang in there, Carnell.

569
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,869
The infection
caused a perforation
in his sigmoid colon.

570
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,004
It's repairable.

571
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,014
But it means
the antibiotics
aren't working.

572
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,414
Double the dose,
and add Tygacil to the list.

Where's Richie Rich?

575
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,016
He said he can't leave work.

00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,189
Yeah, you told me that
two hours ago.

I'm not gonna lie.

578
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,593
Why, 'cause it's wrong?
Or because you're a coward?

579
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,055
Tough choice.

580
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,690
You'd be wasting two hours
of the kid's time.

581
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,036
Is that deeply
and unforgivably
morally wrong? No.

582
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,470
Because it's not
a waste of his time.
Unless we're wrong.

583

Unless his condition's
got nothing to do
with his friend's.

of being wrong.

Yeah, by vomiting blood.

Don't talk to her,
listen to me.

He's vomited in excess
of three units of blood.

596
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,011
He needs to be
admitted before...
If you wanted to be a doctor,

597
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,516
maybe you should
have buckled down
a little more in high school.

were you and Carnell?

Not so close.

Spend a lot of time together
in Jamaica?

00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,852
Share a room?

Wait, you don't think...
Look, we're not gay.

604
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,661
I'm not saying you're gay.
I'm saying you had sex.

00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,133
Look, we're not gay.
We hardly even hung out.

606
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,963
Right. Guess you just
flew him down to Jamaica

'cause he won a contest.

00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,536
No, he's in my frat.

All right,
between school and wrestling

610
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,870
and going home
every break to work
in his father's junkyard,

611
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,103
Carnell didn't have any time
to hang out with anybody.

612
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,304
It's not fungus.

613
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,778
CAMERON: I already
told you that.

00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,372
There's no pustules,

00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,620
His dad owns a scrap metal
salvage yard.

617
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,817
Carnell worked there
during breaks.

618
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,387
You lied.

619
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,797
What are you talking about?

620
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,062
Oh, yeah, of course,
in this family,

621
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,229
you probably
need more specifics.

622
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,468
You told us you owned
a construction company,
not a salvage yard.

623
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,009
I know the way things work.

624
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,511
The better my job,
the better my son
gets treated.

625
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,240
Right, that's why I'm mad,

626
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,805
we wasted all that
filet mignon on you.

627
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,545
Did your kid find anything
unusual the last time
he worked for you?

628
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,643
No.

629
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,710
Braided wire?

630
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,348
Metal weights on each end,
a lead canister,
maybe just a lid.

631
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,415
Probably used it as a doorstop
or a paperweight.

632
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,120
Why would he wanna...

633
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,921
Okay, here it comes.

634
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,726
I gave him
an early graduation gift,

635
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,234
an old plumb I found,
looks like a fishing weight.

636
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,795
Put it on a keychain,
so he'd always remember
where he came from.

637
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,841
So he could lie
about it later?

638
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,536
Where's the keychain?
I don't know,
he never used it.

639
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,101
Just kept it
as a good luck charm.

640
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,306
Kept it where?
I don't know.

In the bureau
back in his regular room.

It mightn't have caused
nerve damage,

but it definitely destroyed
his immune system.

657

And caused tumors.

showed anything.

675
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,564
The equivalent of about
70,000 chest X rays.

676
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,107
His ability
to create white blood cells
has been completely destroyed.

677
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,605
And that's why he can't
fight off this infection?

678
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,717
Yeah. He's gonna need
a bone marrow transplant.

679
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,581
And we did
another PET scan.

680
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:36,049
There's a cavernous angioma
within his spinal cord,
it's a tumor.

681
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,719
That's what's been causing
the shocks and CNS symptoms.

682
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,665
He has a tumor
inside of his spinal cord?

683
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,632
The cord is made of strands

684
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,436
put together,
sort of like a kite string.

685
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:55,739
The surgeon should be able
to pull the strands apart
and excise the tumor.

686
00:31:56,347 --> 00:32:01,011
But surgery on someone
who's as hemopoetically
compromised as your son

687
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,678
is extremely risky.

688
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,825
And,

689
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,399
if you don't do the surgery?
I mean...

690
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,872
The tumor could cause
his breathing to stop.

691
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,338
Possibly his heart as well.

692
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,807
There's no way
you could have known.

693
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,626
Now, you're gonna
have to come with us.

694
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:46,994
You need to start
treatment yourself.

695
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,589
No. No, no.

696
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,766
I can start
my treatment later.

697
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,235
But he can't.

698
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,068
He needs to be
in a sterile isolation room
to prevent further infections.

699
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,810
Mom.
We're early.

700
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,454
It's great to see you.
Oh, Greg, don't lie.

701
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,456
We came at a bad time,
didn't we?

702
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:19,155
Actually, yeah, I think
I have to take a rain check.

703
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,465
Oh, plans have been made.
Wilson made them.

704
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,565
I asked him to cancel.

705
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,001
I'm dealing with a kind
of a complicated case
right now so...

706
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,663
Well, we'll just come back

707
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,867
when things aren't
so out of control.

708
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,342
My team is busy.

709
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,571
You don't wanna see us.

710
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,237
Mom, don't make me
feel guilty.

711
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,248
No, no, of course not.
Sorry.

712
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,410
I've got a patient
who's probably gonna
die of radiation poisoning.

713
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,613
So that means you can't eat?

714
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,953
Come on,
let's grab a bite
in the cafeteria.

715
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,618
I'll buy you a Reuben.

716
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,888
Well, I guess
I got time for a sandwich.

717
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:55,955
Good.

718
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:00,893
Yeah?

719
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,234
I just wanted
to let you know

720
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,830
that Carnell's prepped
for surgery.

721
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,239
Thank you.

722
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,837
Hi, I'm Allison Cameron.
I work with your son.

723
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,043
Greg's told us
all about you.

724
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,106
Really?

725
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,778
New, huh?

726
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,344
Nope, just gullible.

727
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,221
I'm sorry, I was just
making fun of my son,

728
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,418
not of you.

729
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,058
We were just about to go
to get something to eat,

730
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,653
would you care to join us?

731
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,699
You don't have
a lot of time with your son.

732
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,870
Maybe another time.

733
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,174
Do you like the Beatles?
They're all right.

734
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,411
My 1 2-year-old
just turned me
back on to them.

735
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,758
McCartney's gotta have
more money than God.

736
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,057
I think that's all of it.
Reverse him.

737
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,690
How's he doing?

738
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,400
Looks pretty good down here.
Do I rock, or what?

739
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,102
(BEEPlNG)
NURSE:
His pressure's dropping!

740
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,109
Give him another two units.
I did already!

741
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,906
His heart rate's falling.

742
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,808
CHASE: He's hemorrhaging.

743
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,991
They're talking about Mom's
last trip to the dentist.

744
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,818
Grown children
talking to their parents,

745
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,453
nothing gets talked about.

746
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,828
Trust me,
you're not missing anything.

747
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,100
So, besides work,
what you been up to?

748
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,228
Not much.

749
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,704
MR. HOUSE:
You always say that,
"Not much."

750
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,931
It's always the answer.

751
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,443
Any new babes
you might wanna tell me about?

752
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,412
Leave him alone, John.

753
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,941
Got a new motorcycle.

754
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,518
Might have seen it out front,

755
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,952
it's orange
with a gigantic scrape.

756
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,217
Is it the one
in the handicapped parking?

757
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,280
Yeah.

758
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,890
Looks like crap,
but it drives great.

759
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,156
Well, you'll be careful,
right?

760
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,664
Last I checked,
you still have two legs.

761
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,132
Actually, three.

762
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,098
You know what
your problem is, Greg?

763
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,502
Shifting gears?

764
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,200
You just don't know
how lucky you are.

765
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,639
Where's the head?

766
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,980
Well, good thing
we got that cleared up.

767
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,081
Oh, he was just
trying to help.

768
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,625
I don't need help.

769
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,921
I know.

770
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,255
You're absolutely perfect
just the way you are.

771
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,042
Thank you.

772
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,048
So, how much longer
do you think
he'll be in surgery?

773
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,752
It's hard to say.

774
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,831
You know, he just
started school when Ann died.

775
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,965
I was a mess.

776
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,714
Still adjusting
to being a parent,
much less a single parent.

777
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:38,515
You know,
I used to put cold pancakes
in his lunch box.

778
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,955
I mean,
that was the only thing

779
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,687
I could make
that he would eat.

780
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:47,556
You did okay,
he's a good kid.
Yeah.

781
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,464
Hey. So, how is he?

782
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,537
Well, the surgeon
has removed the tumor

783
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,601
without damaging
the spinal cord.

784
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,341
But, the infection has caused

785
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,576
another
intestinal perforation.

786
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,910
We stopped the bleeding,

787
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,011
but his white count
keeps falling.

788
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,214
Okay.

789
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,590
So what now? Another drug,
antibiotics, what?

790
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,696
I'm sorry.

791
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,196
The reality is,
no matter what we give him,

792
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:30,104
it's unlikely
he's gonna be able
to fight off the infections.

793
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,564
Okay, okay.

794

The father and the friend
are responding well
to treatment.

796
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,177
Things aren't looking
so good for Carnell.

797
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,914
Thank you,

798
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,141
for not eating.

799
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,851
It was none of my business.

800
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,153
They seem perfectly pleasant,
don't they?

801
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,850

like everyone else,

she's nice enough,

no great sense of humor,
hates confrontation.

00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,322

I lied to you about Mom.

Why does he hate
seeing his parents?

835
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,511
So his dad tells the truth,
he can't handle that?

836
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,519
He hates
being a disappointment.

can they be?

is worse
