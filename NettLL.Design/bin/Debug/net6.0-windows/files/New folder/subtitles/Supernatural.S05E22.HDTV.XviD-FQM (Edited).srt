1
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:21,027
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities,

2
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:24,329
and play the roles
that destiny has chosen for you.

3
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:25,497
You're <i>the</i> vessel.
Michael's vessel.

4
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:26,932
The answer's no.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,433
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

6
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:30,235
You're the one, Sam.
You're my vessel.

7
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:31,336
That'll never happen.

8
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:39,944
Hi, Lisa. Things are
about to get really bad.

9
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:41,379
Whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't do it.

10
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:42,479
I have to.

11
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:44,048
<i>The cage</i> <i>you 
sprung Lucifer from...</i>

12
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:45,683
<i>you can shove his ass back in.</i>

13
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,920
<i>The key to the cage...</i>
<i>four rings from the Horsemen.</i>

14
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:50,688
- Who is it?
- That's our brother.

15
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:52,590
- What do you mean Adam is gone?
- The angels took him.

16
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:54,190
Maybe they're moving on
from you, Dean.

17
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:56,299
- Think Adam's okay?
- No.

18
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:57,727
Doubt it.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,666
What if <i>you</i> guys lead the devil
to the edge and <i>I</i> jump in?

20
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:04,768
Are you idjits
trying to kill me?!

21
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:09,838
You're going to
let your brother

22
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:12,541
jump right into that fiery pit.

23
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,109
What exactly are you afraid of?

24
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,343
Losing?

25
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,612
Or losing your brother?

26
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:28,222
<i>On April 21, 1967,</i>

27
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,792
<i>The 100 millionth GM vehicle</i>
<i>rolled off the line</i>

28
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,760
<i>at the plant in Janesville...</i>

29
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:35,529
<i>A blue two-door Caprice.</i>

30
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,565
<i>There was a big ceremony,</i>
<i>speeches.</i>

31
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:41,368
<i>The lieutenant governor</i>
<i>even showed up.</i>

32
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:44,805
<i>Three days later, another car</i>
<i>rolled off that same line.</i>

33
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,373
<i>No one gave two craps</i>
<i>about her.</i>

34
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,043
But they should have.

35
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,846
<i>Because,</i>
<i>this 1967 Chevrolet Impala</i>

36
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:55,482
<i>would turn out to be</i>
<i>the most important car...</i>

37
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:59,752
No, the most important <i>object...</i>

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,621
in pretty much
the whole universe.

39
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,091
<i>She was first owned</i>
<i>by Sal Moriarty,</i>

40
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:09,261
<i>an alcoholic with two ex-wives</i>
<i>and three blocked arteries.</i>

41
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,198
<i>On weekends, he'd drive around</i>
<i>giving bibles to the poor.</i>

42
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,667
<i>"Gettin' folks
right for judgment day."</i>

43
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,702
<i>That's what he said.</i>

44
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,203
<i>Sam and Dean</i>
<i>don't know any of this,</i>

45
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,740
<i>but if they did,</i>
<i>I bet they'd smile.</i>

46
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:25,777
<i>After Sal died,</i>
<i>she ended up at rainbow motors,</i>

47
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,847
<i>a used-car lot in Lawrence,</i>

48
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,548
<i>where a young marine</i>
<i>bought her on impulse.</i>

49
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:35,185
<i>That is, after a little advice</i>
<i>from a friend.</i>

50
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:38,789
<i>I guess that's where</i>
<i>this story begins.</i>

51
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,359
And here's where it ends.

52
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,200
Hey.

53
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:01,544
Dean?

54
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:03,611
What's going on?

55
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:06,682
I'm in.

56
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:10,618
In with...?

57
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:12,788
The whole
"up with Satan" thing.

58
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:14,723
I'm on board.

59
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:17,825
You're gonna let me say yes?

60
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,360
No. That's the thing.

61
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:23,230
It's not on me
to <i>let</i> you do anything.

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,335
You're a grown...
well, <i>overgrown...</i> man.

63
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:32,972
If this is what you want,
I'll back your play.

64
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:36,142
That's the last thing
I thought you'd ever say.

65
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,210
Might be.

66
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:40,446
I'm not gonna lie to you, though...

67
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,216
it goes against
every fiber I got.

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,553
I mean, truth is...

69
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:54,659
you know, watching out for you...

70
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:57,930
It's kinda been my job, you know?

71
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:00,432
But more than that, it's...

72
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:02,267
it's kinda who I am.

73
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:05,237
You're not a kid anymore, Sam...

74
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:07,105
and I can't keep
treating you like one.

75
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,511
Maybe <i>I</i> got to grow up
a little, too.

76
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,485
I don't know if we got
a snowball's chance.

77
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:24,054
But...

78
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:26,823
but I do know
that if anybody can do it...

79
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,858
it's you.

80
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:33,063
Thank you.

81
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,299
If this is what you want...

82
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:39,736
is this <i>really</i>
<i>what you want?</i>

83
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,274
I let him out.

84
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,211
I got to put him back in.

85
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,683
Okay.

86
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:57,753
That's it, then.

87
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:13,301
Season 5 Episode 22
    "Swan Song"

88
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,832
I still can't get used
to you at eye level.

89
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,433
So, was I right?

90
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,835
As always, Yoda.

91
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:51,137
Two stunt demons inside,
just like you said.

92
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,105
Did you get it?

93
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,774
Yeah, all the "go juice"
Sammy can drink.

94
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:58,644
You okay?

95
00:05:58,712 --> 00:05:59,677
Not really.

96
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:01,346
What do you got?

97
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:04,015
Not much.
These look like omens to you?

98
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,317
Cyclone in Florida,

99
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:07,719
temperature drop in Detroit,
wildfires in L.A.

100
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,254
Wait. What about Detroit?

101
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,089
Temp's dropped
about 20 degrees,

102
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:13,725
but only in a five-block radius
of downtown Motown.

103
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,959
That's the one.

104
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,727
Devil's in Detroit.

105
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,828
Really?

106
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,629
As far as foreboding goes,

107
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,298
it's a little light
in the loafers.

108
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:22,299
You sure?

109
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,368
Yeah, I'm sure.

110
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:42,084
Aw. Ain't he
a little angel?

111
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,023
Angels don't sleep.

112
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,867
Sam, I got a bad feeling
about this.

113
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,936
Well, you'd be nuts
to have a <i>good</i> feeling about it.

114
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,271
You know what I mean.

115
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,737
Detroit.

116
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:06,274
He always said he'd jump
your bones in Detroit.

117
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,375
Here we are.

118
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:08,910
Here we are.

119
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,912
Maybe this is him rolling out
the red carpet, you know?

120
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,479
Maybe he knows something
that we don't.

121
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:15,016
Dean, I'm sure
he knows a <i>butt-load</i> we don't.

122
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,918
We just got to hope
he doesn't know about the rings.

123
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,860
Hey, um...

124
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,162
On the subject, there's something
I got to talk to you about.

125
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,163
What?

126
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:33,333
This thing goes our way

127
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:36,001
and I... triple Lindy
into that box...

128
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,439
y-you know
I'm not coming back.

129
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:43,642
Yeah, I'm aware.

130
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:47,079
So you got to
promise me something.

131
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:49,214
Okay. Yeah, anything.

132
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:54,284
You got to promise
not to try to bring me back.

133
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:56,520
What?

134
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:58,556
No, I didn't sign up for that.

135
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:00,091
Dean...

136
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:01,692
Your hell is gonna make my tour
look like Graceland.

137
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,761
Y-you want me just to sit by
and do nothing?

138
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:06,029
Once the cage is shut,
you <i>can't</i> go poking at it, Dean.

139
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:08,730
- It's too risky.
- No, no, no, no, no.

140
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,366
As if I'm just gonna
let you rot in there.

141
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:10,834
Yeah, you are.
You don't have a choice.

142
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:11,969
You can't ask me to do this.

143
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:14,170
I'm sorry, Dean.
You <i>have</i> to.

144
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,908
So then what am I
supposed to do?

145
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,445
You go find Lisa.

146
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:23,446
You pray to God she's
dumb enough to take you in,

147
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:27,616
and you... you have barbecues
and go to football games.

148
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:30,853
You go live some normal,
apple-pie life, Dean.

149
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,556
Promise me.

150
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:54,609
Demons.

151
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,443
At least two dozen of them.

152
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:57,911
You were right... something's up.

153
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,813
More than something.

154
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,382
He's here, I know it.

155
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,202
I'll see ya around, kid.

156
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,670
See ya around.

157
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:37,249
He gets in...

158
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:39,851
you fight him tooth and nail,
you understand?

159
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,521
Keep swingin', don't give an inch.

160
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,754
Yes, sir.

161
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,167
You take care of these guys, okay?

162
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,936
That's not possible.

163
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:05,975
Then humor me.

164
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:08,077
Oh, I was supposed to lie.

165
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,613
Uh...

166
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:13,748
Sure. They'll be fine. I...

167
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,750
Just...
just stop... talking.

168
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,701
You mind not watching this?

169
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,420
Okay.

170
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:55,054
Let's go.

171
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,231
All right!

172
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,633
We're here,
you sons of bitches!

173
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,801
Come and get it!

174
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,939
Hey, guys.

175
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,441
Is your father home?

176
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,218
Hey, guys.

177
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:30,020
So nice of you to drop in.

178
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,130
<i>The Impala, of course,</i>

179
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,098
<i>has all the things</i>
<i>other cars have...</i>

180
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,033
<i>and a few things they</i> don't.

181
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:46,936
<i>But none of that stuff's</i>
<i>important.</i>

182
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:50,606
<i>This</i> is the stuff
that's important.

183
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,608
<i>The army man that Sam</i>
<i>crammed in the ashtray...</i>

184
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:54,644
<i>it's still stuck there.</i>

185
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:57,112
<i>The legos that Dean shoved</i>
<i>into the vents...</i>

186
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,281
<i>to this day, heat comes on</i>
<i>and they can hear 'em rattle.</i>

187
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,284
<i>These are the things</i>
<i>that make the car theirs...</i>

188
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,754
really <i>theirs.</i>

189
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:08,056
<i>Even when Dean rebuilt her</i>
<i>from the ground up,</i>

190
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,892
<i>he made sure</i>
<i>all these little things stayed,</i>

191
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,294
<i>'cause it's the blemishes</i>
<i>that make her beautiful.</i>

192
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,065
<i>The devil doesn't know or care</i>

193
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:19,133
<i>what kind of car</i>
<i>the boys drive.</i>

194
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:23,271
Sorry if it's a bit chilly.

195
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,374
Most people think I burn hot.

196
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,010
It's actually quite the opposite.

197
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,644
Well, I'll alert the media.

198
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:40,120
Help me understand something,
guys.

199
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:41,921
I mean, stomping through
my front door

200
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,892
is... a tad suicidal,
don't you think?

201
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,594
We're not here to fight you.

202
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:48,794
No?

203
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:51,962
- Then why are you?
- I want to say "yes."

204
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,932
Excuse me?

205
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,909
Chock-full of Ovaltine, are we?

206
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:05,510
You heard me.

207
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,511
Yes.

208
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,613
You're serious.

209
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,419
Look, judgment day's
a runaway train.

210
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,321
We get it now,
we just want off.

211
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:17,322
Meaning?

212
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,991
Deal of the century.

213
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,792
I give you a free ride,
but when it's all over,

214
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,562
I live, he lives,
you bring our parents back...

215
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,564
Okay, can we please
drop the Telenovela?

216
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,001
I know you have the rings, Sam.

217
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,206
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

218
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:42,111
The Horsemen's rings?

219
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,548
The magic keys to my cage?

220
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,518
Ring a bell?

221
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,920
Come on, Sam.
I've never lied to you.

222
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,522
You could at least
pay me the same respect.

223
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:58,060
It's okay. I'm not mad.

224
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,828
A wrestling match
inside your noggin...

225
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,997
I like the idea.

226
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:07,602
Just you and me,
one round, no tricks.

227
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,337
You win, you jump in the hole.

228
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,173
<i>I</i> win...

229
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,008
well, then I win.

230
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:17,545
What do you say, Sam?

231
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,813
A fiddle of gold
against your soul

232
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,915
says I'm better than you-ou.

233
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,188
So he knows.
Doesn't change anything.

234
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:29,989
Sam.

235
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,724
- We don't have any other choice.
- No.

236
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,229
Yes.

237
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:16,533
Sammy!

238
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:18,235
- Dean!
- Sammy!

239
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:22,005
I can feel him.

240
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:23,607
- Oh, God!
- You got to go now!

241
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,907
Come on!

242
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,112
Go now, Sammy.

243
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,813
Now!

244
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,800
I was just messing with you.

245
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,970
Sammy's long gone.

246
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,770
I told you...

247
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,640
this would always happen
in Detroit.

248
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,336
Sam.

249
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,503
Come on.

250
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,873
I can feel you...

251
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:13,108
scratching away in there.

252
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,914
Look...

253
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:22,083
I'll take the gag off, okay?

254
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,290
You got me all wrong, kiddo.

255
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,293
I'm not the bad guy here.

256
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:34,962
I'm gonna rip you apart
from the inside out.

257
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,597
Do you understand me?

258
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,135
Such anger...

259
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:42,737
young Skywalker.

260
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:48,808
Who are you <i>really</i>
<i>angry with?</i>

261
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,543
Me?

262
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,279
Or that face in the mirror?

263
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:54,781
I'm sure this is all
a big joke to you, huh?

264
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:55,882
Not at all.

265
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,550
I've been waiting for you...

266
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:02,053
for a long, <i>long</i> time.

267
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:04,089
Come on, Sam.

268
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:06,057
You have to admit...

269
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,827
you can feel it, right?

270
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:11,428
- What?
- The exhilaration.

271
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,532
And you know why that is?

272
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,668
Because we're two halves
made whole.

273
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:18,269
M.F.E.O.

274
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,537
Literally.

275
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:22,640
This feels
pretty damn far from good.

276
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,777
I'm inside
your grapefruit, Sam.

277
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:29,046
You can't lie to me.

278
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,981
I see it all.

279
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,950
How odd you always felt,

280
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:38,021
how... out of place

281
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,457
in that... family of yours.

282
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,994
And why shouldn't you have?

283
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:47,163
They were foster care... at best.

284
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:49,665
<i>I'm</i> your real family.

285
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,334
No, that's not true.

286
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,301
It is.

287
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,338
And I know you know it.

288
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:58,173
All those times you ran away,

289
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:00,108
you weren't running
from <i>them.</i>

290
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,610
You were running
towards <i>me.</i>

291
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,883
This doesn't have to be
a bad thing, you know.

292
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:12,454
I let Dean live, didn't I?

293
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:13,988
I <i>want</i> him to live.

294
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:16,458
I'll bring your folks
back, too.

295
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:20,494
I want you to be happy, Sam.

296
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:23,731
I don't want <i>anything</i>
<i>from you...</i>

297
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,200
Really?

298
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,771
Not even a little payback?

299
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,373
What's that supposed to mean?

300
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,408
Look closely.

301
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:39,011
None of these little devils
look familiar to you?

302
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,818
That's Mr. Bensman.

303
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,353
One of my grade-school teachers.

304
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:50,623
And that's your friend Doug
from that time in East Lansing.

305
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,092
And Rachel...

306
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,660
your prom date.

307
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,865
Sam Winchester,
this is your life.

308
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,566
Azazel's gang...

309
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:05,136
watching you since
you were a rug-rat.

310
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,873
Jerking you around
like a dog on a leash.

311
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,510
I know how you feel about them.

312
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,478
Me too.

313
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,048
So, what do you say you and I
blow off a little steam?

314
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,653
Reports are flooding in... a 7.6
earthquake in Portland,

315
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,487
<i>8.1 in Boston,</i>

316
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:27,089
<i>More in Hong Kong,</i>
<i>Berlin, and Tehran</i>

317
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:29,659
<i>The U.S.G.S. has no explanation</i>

318
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,161
<i>But says to expect</i>
<i>a six-figure death toll.</i>

319
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:33,863
It's starting.

320
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:36,165
Yeah, you think, genius?

321
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,501
You don't have to be mean.

322
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,135
So what do we do now?

323
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:47,509
I suggest we imbibe
copious quantities of alcohol.

324
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,511
Just wait for the
inevitable blast wave.

325
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:50,979
Yeah, swell.
Thank you, Bukowski.

326
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,247
I-I mean,
how do we stop it?

327
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:57,217
We don't.

328
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:02,490
Lucifer <i>will</i> meet Michael
on the chosen field,

329
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,525
and the battle of Armageddon begins.

330
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,461
Okay, well,
where's this chosen field?

331
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:07,962
I don't know.

332
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:10,865
Well, there's got to be
something that we can do.

333
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,533
I'm sorry, Dean.
This is over.

334
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,802
You listen to me,
you junk-less sissy...

335
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,504
we are <i>not</i> giving up!

336
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:20,005
Bobby?

337
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,908
Bobby?

338
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:31,149
There was never much hope
to begin with.

339
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,488
I don't know what else to do.

340
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:00,777
So...

341
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:02,546
are we having fun yet?

342
00:22:09,898 --> 00:22:11,298
<i>In between jobs,</i>

343
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:13,367
<i>Sam and Dean</i>
<i>would sometimes get a day...</i>

344
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:15,669
<i>sometimes a</i> week,
<i>if they were lucky.</i>

345
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:18,070
<i>They'd pass the time</i>
<i>lining their pockets.</i>

346
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,306
<i>Sam used to insist</i>
<i>on honest work,</i>

347
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:24,010
<i>but now he hustles pool,</i>
<i>like his brother.</i>

348
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,445
<i>They could go anywhere</i>
<i>and do anything.</i>

349
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:28,848
<i>They drove over a 1,000 miles</i>
<i>for an Ozzy show.</i>

350
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,250
<i>Two days for a Jayhawks game.</i>

351
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,020
<i>And when it was clear,</i>

352
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,823
<i>they'd park her</i>
<i>in the middle of nowhere,</i>

353
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:41,126
<i>sit on the hood,</i>
<i>and watch the stars...</i>

354
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,396
<i>for hours...</i>

355
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,630
<i>Without saying a word.</i>

356
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,835
<i>It never occurred to them...</i>
<i>that sure,</i>

357
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,738
<i>maybe they never really had</i>
<i>a roof and four walls...</i>

358
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,708
<i>But they were never,</i>
<i>in fact, homeless.</i>

359
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,479
That's a good line.

360
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:08,518
Mistress Magda?

361
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:11,788
Um, no, Chuck.

362
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:13,790
Oh, uh, Dean.

363
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:16,526
Uh, wow. I, uh,
I didn't know that you'd call.

364
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:17,961
Who's Mistress Magda?

365
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,663
Nothing. She's a, uh, a...

366
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,064
Just a, uh... a close friend.

367
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,533
Yeah, I'll bet... <i>real</i> close.
Whatever happened to Becky?

368
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:25,801
You know, it didn't work out.

369
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:29,038
I had too much respect for her.

370
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:30,773
Boy, you really got a whole virgin/hooker
thing going on, don't you?

371
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,541
Okay, this can't be
why you called.

372
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,744
Sam said yes.

373
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:37,478
I know.

374
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,380
I saw it.

375
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,215
I'm just working on the pages.

376
00:23:41,283 --> 00:23:43,250
Did you see where
the title fight goes down?

377
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:45,753
The angels are keeping it
top secret.

378
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:46,821
Very hush-hush.

379
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:47,889
Aw, crap.

380
00:23:47,957 --> 00:23:49,523
But I saw it anyway.

381
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:52,460
Perks of being a prophet.

382
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:55,261
It's tomorrow, high noon...

383
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:57,698
place called Stull cemetery.

384
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,733
Stull ceme...

385
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:01,134
Wait. I know that.

386
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:03,870
That's... that's an old bone-yard
outside of Lawrence.

387
00:24:03,938 --> 00:24:04,905
Why Lawrence?

388
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:06,172
I don't know.

389
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,674
It all has to end
where it started, I guess.

390
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:08,941
All right, Chuck.

391
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:10,710
You know of any way
to short-circuit this thing?

392
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:11,811
Besides the rings?

393
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:14,246
No. I'm sorry.

394
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:15,481
Well, do you have any idea
what's gonna happen next?

395
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:16,749
I wish that I did.

396
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:19,919
But I-I just...
I honestly don't know yet.

397
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:23,756
All right. Thanks, Chuck.

398
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:31,930
You goin' someplace?

399
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:38,336
You're goin'
to do somethin' stupid.

400
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:40,238
You got that look.

401
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,239
I'm gonna go talk to Sam.

402
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:44,074
You just don't give up.

403
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:45,275
It's Sam!

404
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:46,710
If you couldn't
reach him here,

405
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,211
You're certainly not gonna be
able to on the battlefield.

406
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,647
Well, if we've already lost,

407
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:51,248
I guess I got
nothing to lose, right?

408
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,786
I just want you
to understand...

409
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:59,388
The <i>only</i> thing
that you're gonna see out there

410
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,958
is Michael killing your brother.

411
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:08,330
Well, then I ain't
gonna let him die alone.

412
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:51,470
It's good to see you, Michael.

413
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:53,372
You too.

414
00:25:54,474 --> 00:25:56,009
It's been too long.

415
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:57,310
Can you believe
it's finally here?

416
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:01,113
No.

417
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:04,183
Not really.

418
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,586
Are you ready?

419
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:14,893
As I'll ever be.

420
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:19,430
A part of me wishes
we didn't have to do this.

421
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,701
Yeah.

422
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:25,469
Me too.

423
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,071
Then why <i>are</i> we?

424
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:28,339
Oh, you know why.

425
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:31,776
I have no choice,
after what you did.

426
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:33,844
What I did?

427
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,511
What if it's not my fault?

428
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:36,679
What is that supposed to mean?

429
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:37,647
Think about it.

430
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:40,450
Dad made everything.

431
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:44,888
Which means
he <i>made</i> me who I am.

432
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:47,457
God <i>wanted</i> the devil.

433
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,258
So?

434
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,127
So why?

435
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,561
And why make us fight?

436
00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:55,965
I just can't
figure out the point.

437
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,767
What's <i>your</i> point?

438
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:01,203
We're going to kill each other.

439
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,639
And for what?

440
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,840
One of dad's tests.

441
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:07,776
And we don't even
know the answer.

442
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,279
We're brothers.

443
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:16,484
Let's just
walk off the chessboard.

444
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:24,958
I'm sorry.
I-I can't do that.

445
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,796
I'm a good son,
and I have my orders.

446
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,063
But you don't
have to follow them.

447
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:32,065
What,
you think I'm gonna rebel?

448
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:33,100
Now?

449
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:34,802
I'm not like you.

450
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,136
Please, Michael...

451
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:38,672
You know, you haven't changed
a bit, little brother.

452
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:41,207
Always blaming
everybody but yourself.

453
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:43,910
We were together.
We were happy.

454
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:45,878
But you betrayed me,
all of us...

455
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:47,280
and you made our father leave.

456
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:49,215
No one makes dad do <i>anything.</i>

457
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:51,318
He is doing this <i>to</i> us.

458
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:58,324
You're a monster, Lucifer.

459
00:27:58,391 --> 00:27:59,991
And I have to kill you.

460
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:03,562
If that's the way
it's got to be...

461
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:09,167
then I'd like
to see you try.

462
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:07,856
Howdy, boys.

463
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:15,529
Sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

464
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:19,254
Hey.

465
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,755
We need to talk.

466
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,164
Dean.

467
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:31,233
Even for you,

468
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:34,101
this is a whole new
mountain of stupid.

469
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:36,970
I'm not talking to <i>you.</i>
<i>I'm talking to, Sam.</i>

470
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:39,507
You're no longer
the vessel, Dean.

471
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:40,974
You got no right to be here.

472
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:45,879
Adam, if you're in there
somewhere, I am so sorry.

473
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,682
Adam isn't home right now.

474
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:49,516
Well, then you're next
on my list, Buttercup.

475
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,284
But right now, I need
five minutes with <i>him.</i>

476
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:52,552
You little maggot.

477
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,821
You are no longer
a part of this story!

478
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:56,155
Hey, ass-butt!

479
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,438
"Ass-butt"?

480
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:14,773
He'll be back... and upset...

481
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:16,975
but you got your five minutes.

482
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:18,510
Castiel.

483
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,450
Did you just Molotov
my brother with holy fire?

484
00:30:27,153 --> 00:30:28,253
Uh... no.

485
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,989
No one dicks with
Michael, but <i>me.</i>

486
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:47,371
Sammy, can you hear me?

487
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,842
You know...

488
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,310
I tried to be nice...

489
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:56,312
for Sammy's sake.

490
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,347
But you...

491
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:01,184
are such a pain...

492
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:04,287
in my ass.

493
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:23,137
N-o-o-o-o!

494
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:24,639
Yes.

495
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,580
Sammy?

496
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:35,649
Are you in there?

497
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:37,051
Oh, he's in there, all right.

498
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:41,155
And he's gonna feel
the snap of your bones.

499
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:46,893
Every single one.

500
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:50,663
We're gonna take our time.

501
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,804
Sam, it's okay.

502
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:00,605
It's okay. I'm here.

503
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:01,773
I'm here.

504
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:03,342
I'm not gonna leave you.

505
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:06,778
I'm not gonna leave you.

506
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,248
It's okay, Dean.

507
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,618
It's gonna be okay.

508
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,821
I've got him.

509
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:12,496
Sam!

510
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:16,033
It's not gonna end this way!

511
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:17,268
Step back!

512
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:18,936
You're gonna
have to <i>make</i> me!

513
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:21,205
I have to fight
my brother, Sam!

514
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:23,073
Here and now!

515
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,740
It's my destiny!

516
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,274
Cass, you're alive?

517
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,375
I'm better than that.

518
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:04,558
Cass, are you God?

519
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:07,061
That's a nice compliment,

520
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:08,095
but no.

521
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:13,067
Although, I do believe
he brought me back.

522
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:18,072
New and improved.

523
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,634
<i>Endings are hard.</i>

524
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:53,938
<i>Any chapped-ass monkey</i>
<i>with a keyboard</i>

525
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:57,808
<i>Can poop out a beginning,</i>
<i>but endings are impossible.</i>

526
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:59,944
<i>You try to tie up</i>
<i>every loose end,</i>

527
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,145
<i>but you never can.</i>

528
00:37:01,213 --> 00:37:03,081
<i>The fans</i>
<i>are always gonna bitch.</i>

529
00:37:03,148 --> 00:37:04,815
<i>There's always gonna be holes.</i>

530
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:06,550
<i>And since it's the ending,</i>

531
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:08,218
<i>it's all supposed to</i>
<i>add up to something.</i>

532
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:10,487
<i>I'm telling you, they're</i>
<i>a raging pain in the ass.</i>

533
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:17,494
What are you gonna do now?

534
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,796
Return to heaven, I suppose.

535
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,731
Heaven?

536
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,133
With Michael in the cage,

537
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,800
I'm sure it's total
anarchy up there.

538
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,369
So, what... you're
the new sheriff in town?

539
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:30,373
I like that. Yeah,
I suppose I am.

540
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,807
Wow.

541
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,143
God gives you a brand-new,
shiny set of wings,

542
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,212
and suddenly
you're his bitch again.

543
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,780
I don't know
<i>what</i> God wants.

544
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,681
I don't know
if he'll even return.

545
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:42,617
It just... seems like
the right thing to do.

546
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:44,452
Well, if you do see him...

547
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,054
you tell him
I'm coming for him next.

548
00:37:48,257 --> 00:37:49,824
You're angry.

549
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,461
That's an understatement.

550
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:54,829
He helped.

551
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,363
Maybe even
more than we realize.

552
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:58,032
That's easy for <i>you</i> to say.
He brought you back.

553
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,566
But what about Sam?

554
00:37:59,634 --> 00:38:00,901
What about <i>me,</i> huh?

555
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,636
Where's my grand prize?

556
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:05,205
All I got is
my brother in a hole!

557
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:08,175
You got what you asked for, Dean.

558
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,412
No paradise. No hell.

559
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:15,148
Just more of the same.

560
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:18,851
I mean it, Dean.

561
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:21,587
What would you rather have?

562
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:24,623
Peace or freedom?

563
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:35,700
Well, you really suck
at goodbye's, you know that?

564
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:45,042
<i>This is the last Dean and Bobby</i>
<i>will see of each other</i>

565
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,945
<i>for a very long time.</i>

566
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:54,918
<i>And for the record...</i>
<i>at this point next week,</i>

567
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,921
<i>Bobby will be hunting a Rugaru</i>
<i>outside of Dayton.</i>

568
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,723
<i>But not Dean.</i>

569
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,924
<i>Dean didn't want Cass</i>
<i>to save him.</i>

570
00:39:01,993 --> 00:39:04,160
<i>Every part of him,</i>
<i>every fiber he's got,</i>

571
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:05,895
<i>wants to die...</i>

572
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:08,164
<i>or find a way</i>
<i>to bring Sam back.</i>

573
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:10,300
<i>But he isn't gonna do either.</i>

574
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:12,735
<i>Because he made a promise.</i>

575
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,512
Hey, Lisa.

576
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,382
Oh, thank God.

577
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:27,749
Are you all right?

578
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:33,154
Yeah.

579
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:35,990
Uh, if it's not too late, I...

580
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:38,592
think I'd like
to take you up on that beer.

581
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,031
It's never too late.

582
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,805
It's okay.

583
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:55,608
It's gonna be okay.

584
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,115
<i>So, what's it all add up to?</i>

585
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:04,150
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

586
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,885
<i>But me,</i>
<i>I'd say this</i> was <i>a test...</i>

587
00:40:06,953 --> 00:40:09,088
<i>for Sam and Dean.</i>

588
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,424
<i>And I think they did all right.</i>

589
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,293
<i>Up against good, evil,</i>

590
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:19,198
<i>angels, devils, destiny</i>
<i>and God himself.</i>

591
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:22,033
<i>They made their own choice.</i>

592
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:24,569
<i>They chose family.</i>

593
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:26,971
<i>And, well...</i>

594
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,541
<i>isn't that</i>
<i>kinda the whole point?</i>

595
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:38,715
<i>No doubt... endings are hard,</i>

596
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:41,918
<i>but then again...</i>

597
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:45,021
<i>nothing ever really ends,</i>
<i>does it?</i>

598
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:59,268
You okay?

599
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:01,471
Yeah, I'm good.
