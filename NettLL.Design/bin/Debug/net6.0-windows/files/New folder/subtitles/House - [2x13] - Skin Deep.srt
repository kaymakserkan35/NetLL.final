00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,836
Nurse! Nurse!

169
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,318
You son of a bitch!
You killed her!

170
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,521
She's not dead.
She had a heart attack.

171
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,224
She's stable now.
The anesthesia...

172
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,823
Get her out of that coma.

173
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,266
I don't think so.
Stop this!

174
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,431
AII right,
I don't consent anymore.

175
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,141
I want her
to do the slow detox.

176
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,812
Did you ever get a paper cut?
A really nasty one,
between the fingers?

177
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,842
Multiply that
by about a billion

178
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,580
and you'II just barely
approach the kind of suffering
she'II experience

179
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,212
if we wake her up now.

180
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,818
We're committed to this.

181
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,588
She's out till morning.
Go get a book.

182
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,476
I haven't slept in weeks,
because my teeth hurt.

183
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,076
The dentist
couldn't find any cavities.

184
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,445
And I'm getting
these headaches.

185
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,508
Oh! Poor you.

186
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,288
I think I'm going crazy.

187
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,316
And my stomach,
I roll out of bed
and I wanna puke.

188
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,319
I take it you're married?

189
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,764
You must be psychic.
You must be witty.

190
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,702
When's she due?
How'd you know she was...

191
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,900
Because I'm doing her.
You've got Couvade Syndrome.

192
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,877
It's just
a fancy way of saying
you should stop whining.

193
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,743
Millions of women
have got the same thing.
They're not bugging me.

194
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,942
You're suffering from
sympathetic pregnancy.

195
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,551
Gotta go. People dying.

196
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,245
Whole circle of Iife thing.
It's all in my head?

197
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,755
No, it's all in your hormones.

198
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,285
The good news is,
no one's gonna Iecture you
if you smoke and get drunk.

199
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:52,686
(DOOR SLAMMING)

200
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,693
Shouldn't she be awake
by now?

201
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,501
It's only been a half an hour
since we stopped the medicine.

202
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,064
Well, you said
that's how Iong it would take.

203
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,508
I said it would take
about a half an hour.

204
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,445
But couldn't this mean
something more...
So far, it means nothing.

205
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,448
She had a heart attack.
She could have brain damage.

206
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,280
She could have
something more...
She's opening her eyes.

207
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,544
AIex, you okay?

208
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,680
Can you hear me?

209
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,298
I got the cute doctor.

210
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,199
Do you feel any pain?

211
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,371
Good. Let us know
if anything changes.

212
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,905
If your stomach
doesn't feel right, anything.

213
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,265
Hey.

214
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,243
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

215
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,414
I Iet you down.

216
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,817
No, no. Not at all, sweetie,
I...

217
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,448
I should have been
more mature. I should have
handled the pressure.

218
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,888
Stop, stop.

219
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,454
We're gonna get you better,
all right?
Nothing else matters.

220
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,827
CHASE: Excuse me.

221
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,870
I've got you on
what we call a "banana bag".

222
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,630
PIenty of vitamins,
nutrients...

223
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,538
I got the cute doctor.

224
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,275
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

225
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,643
ALEX: I Iet you down.
What's going on?

226
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,618
I should have been
more mature. I should have
handled the pressure.

227
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,953
MARTIN: What's wrong with her?

228
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,853
Anterograde amnesia,
short term memory Ioss.

229
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,296
Evidence of a hypoxic
brain injury.

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,263
It might be the result
of getting cut off from
the oxygen when she flatlined.

231
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,568
Probably the result
of that rapid detox
you told us to push on her.

232
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,107
You gonna put that down?

233
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,368
(INHALING)

234
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,945
Are you gonna sulk?

235
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,654
I'm not gonna indulge you.

236
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,282
The treatment for
hypoxic brain injuries
consists of...

237
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,159
Cameron, Chase
and the Dark One.

238
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,924
Foreman, right?

239
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,159
The patient flatlined
for Iike, 30 seconds.

240
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,598
You've got to be
oxygen-deprived

241
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,260
for Ionger than that
to Iose brain function.

242
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,305
We can't be sure
how Iong she was...
Her brain's fine.

243
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,397
Memory Ioss.

244
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,066
You're saying that's not
a neurological symptom?

245
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,009
No, I'm saying
what I'm saying.
Her brain's fine.

246
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,244
She's faking?

247
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,475
She's got
posttraumatic stress disorder.

248
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,083
We got models
fighting in Iraq now?

249
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,313
Show me a woman on heroin
who Iooks Iike that,

250
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,686
and I'II show you a woman
who's been sexually abused.

251
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,486
That's your proof?
That she's good Iooking.

252
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:39,189
He manages her career,
travels the world with her,
at her side 24/7.

253
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,728
He's either a very good dad or
a very bad dad.

254
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,868
HOUSE: You saw that tokus.

255
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,702
Would the fact that
she's your daughter
really stop you?

256
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,762
(SCOFFING)

257
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,710
Her brain is running away
from reality and when the
drugs can't do it anymore,

258
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,370
it starts to shut down.

259
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:58,013
Your theory has the advantages
of being
completely un-provable

260
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,313
and completely
exculpating you.

261
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,750
When you guys
are done talking,
do an MRI and an LP.

262
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,255
When her brain
checks out as normal,

263
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,157
then we'II know
that daddy really,
really Ioves her.

264
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,824
Where's House?

265
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,859
He said he was
in too much pain to work.
Who's covering?

266
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,302
He called 15 minutes
after his shift started.

267
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,034
It was too Iate
to find anybody.
Exam Room One.

268
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,240
Hi.
Where's Dr. House?

269
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,046
I wish I knew.
What's the problem?

270
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,752
It's personal.

271
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,590
And it's so personal
he didn't bother writing
anything in your chart.

272
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,457
It's getting worse.
What is?

273
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,623
It's personal.

274
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,659
Fine. You can wait.
Doctor!

275
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,711
I tell you what.

276
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,940
I am going to give you
Dr. House's
personal pager number.

277
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,953
Why would your mind
go to abuse so fast?

278
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,091
Because I had a funny uncle.
You were abused?

279
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,255
What? No.
Why'd your mind
go to that so fast?

280
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,724
I just had a funny uncle.
Great stories, always filthy.

281
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,201
I don't know
if it's something
with this case

282
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,433
or you got
something personal going on,
the whole breakup thing?

283
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,997
It's personal.
House.

284
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,542
Your pain is affecting
your decision-making.

285
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,947
You got a problem
with a call I make,
question the call.

286
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,380
Don't make it personal.

287
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,816
Are you saying
pain can't affect your mood?

288
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,687
If I'm right about the pain,
you're gonna wanna
rush everything,

289
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,383
which is what you're doing.

290
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,285
Don't.

291
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,762
Thank you.

292
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,030
Are you doing your daughter?
What?

293
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,073
We should probably
talk privately, huh?
Come on, walk with me.

294
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,654
Come on.
He's not!

295
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,714
I'm sure he's not.
She is a babe, though.

296
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,907
We're gonna need you
to keep still.
I am.

297
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,709
What do you think
that means?

298
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,281
It's either neurological
or psychological.

299
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,415
The only thing we know
for sure is it's gonna
screw up the MRI results,

300
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,285
which is gonna
make House think he's right.

301
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,954
This is a waste of time.

302
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,356
Let's just get the LP.

303
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,724
I should take your head off.

304
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,501
Your glands are fine.
See, now, you're my patient.

305
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,768
You got doctor-patient
confidentiality. No worries.

306
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,874
So, what did you do to her?
Why would you
possibly think...

307
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,139
Hard to imagine anyone
not wanting to nail her.

308
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,511
You son of...
It's a compliment.

309
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,985
That heart-shaped ass,
those perfect, perky,
all-natural breasts.

310
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,078
That is my daughter
you're talking about!

311
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,147
No, that's your daughter
you were talking about.

312
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,156
"She just instinctively
knows how to walk.

313
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,822
"Designers just Iove
that heart-shaped ass,
those perfect, perky..."

314
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,889
I'm her manager.
I have to promote her.

315
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,867
Oh, that makes sense.

316
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,964
So you compartmentalize.

317
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,528
When you're
dealing with the press,
you're her manager.

318
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,041
When you're helping
with homework, you're her dad.

319
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,340
When you're making
sweet, sweet Iove,
you're her manager.

320
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,471
AII right.
Do you Iove her?

321
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,641
I have never touched her.
Do you Iove her?

322
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,844
What are you doing?
Are you trying
to trap me into saying...

323
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,320
Do you Iove her enough
to admit that you
slept with her?

324
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,623
Psychological conditions
can manifest themselves
in physical problems.

325
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,290
Sometimes these can be
extreme enough to kill.

326
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,228
There are treatments,
but only
if there is a diagnosis.

327
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,805
Are you going to admit
that you slept
with your daughter

328
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,863
or are you just gonna
Iet her die?

329
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,344
One time.

330
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,225
PTSD.

331
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,466
Get her a psyche referral,
pack her bags. He did her.

332
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,506
Don't think so.
Daddy thinks so.

333
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,442
He could be mistaken.
He said he was drunk.

334
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,069
Maybe it was
some other daughter.

You're wrong about PTSD
and I was wrong about
the hypoxic brain injury.

337
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,249
Daddy didn't do this to her.
And neither did we.

if I save her Iife first
or do you want to make sure

that daddy
doesn't get visitation rights
to the gravesite?

344
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,947
Okay, elevated proteins
in her CSF could mean
dozens of different things.

Viral encephalitis, CNSV,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

346

So we're just gonna Ieave
a child molester in the
same room as his victim?

Fine. Arrest him.

for Iunch and is rapidly

in case
he's got any more secrets

that I need to know about.

355
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,841
Now, if you're not
too distracted, go take out
a piece of her brain,

356
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,510
stick it under a microscope.

Just for my own clarity,
how many more patients
do you have to kill

364
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,744

this Ieg thing
just might be a problem?

We're gonna do something
called a burr-hole biopsy.

We drill a small opening
in the back of your skull.

should talk about this first.

No.

to be overwhelmed right now.

I think she should have a say
in what happens to her body.

anyways.

the amnesia is only temporary.

We checked the pancreas.

499
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,993
Obviously,
you've taken something.
Did you check the bones?

500
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,689
There are a Iot of bones,
I think.

501
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,662
And none of them have cancer.

502
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,563
Ovaries?
There's no mass.

503
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,965
If anything,
they're undersized.

504
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,266
No Ieukemia, no Hodgkin's,
we checked everything.

505
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,863
Unless they've invented
a new organ, it's not cancer.

506
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,906
Differential diagnosis.
It's gotta be cancer.

507
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,747
There's gotta be something
we missed.

508
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,412
You've got to Iearn
to Iet go, Foreman.

509
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:40,150
Maybe the protein Ievel
was some sort of anomaly.

510
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,714
It might just still be PTSD.

511
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,317
Just PTSD?

512
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,124
Yeah, Daddy's diddling her.
Nothing to worry about.

513
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,687
Okay, Iet me rephrase.

514
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,427
CHASE: Maybe the protein Ievel
was some sort of anomaly.

515
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,763
Oh, my God!

516
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,097
It might be PTSD!

517
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,072
If it was PTSD,
the twitching wouldn't have
magically disappeared

518
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,971
when we started the IVIG.

519
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,769
Wrong.

520
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,108
What it wouldn't have done
was medically disappear.

521
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,247
Nothing to stop it
from magically disappearing.

522
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,047
She was watching me
start and stop the medicine.

523
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,985
You think she's faking?

524
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,522
Not consciously.

525
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,150
But if her subconscious
is trying
to get away from it all,

526
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,421
cancer's gotta
be a Iovely vacation spot.

527
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,264
Tell her you've got to give
her a fresh IV. Don't tell her
you're starting her on saline.

528
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,131
See if the twitching
comes back.

529
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,239
How Iong has the social worker
been in there?

530
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,007
Just went in. She was
in with the dad before.

531
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,216
You switched the girl's IV?
About a half an hour ago.

532
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,412
When's she gonna
start twitching?

533
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,317
If she's gonna
start twitching.

534
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,685
Another few minutes.

535
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,920
We've got to wait
for the remaining IVIG
to clear her system.

536
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,021
That was quick.
What's gonna happen?

537
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,757
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

538
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,765
The father had sex...
Do you have any
medical evidence of that?

539
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,027
He admitted...
He denies the conversation
ever took place.

540
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,429
But she...
She denies it, too.

541
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,972
I'm sure you meant well.

542
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,117
You have to
tell her the truth.

543
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,517
Nothing happened.

544
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,250
You don't have to
be afraid of him.
They can protect you.

545
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,121
From what? Things are fine.

546
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,457
You think things are fine.
They're not.

547
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,693
He's my dad.
He's abusing you.

548
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,264
He's not a bad person.

549
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,305
I seduced him.

550
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,501
You're the child.
He's the adult.

551
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,445
He has the responsibility...
I got him drunk.

552
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,073
I had to get him drunk.

553
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,984
I wanted to
have sex with him.

554
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,946
You're sexually attracted
to your father?

555
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,314
No.

556
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:57,723
But by sleeping with him,
now he Iets me do
whatever I want.

557
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,967
I also slept with my
photographer, my financial
manager and my tutor.

558
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,198
If I hadn't,
I'd be getting C's

back in Detroit.

No, we don't.

slept with you,
you were traumatized.

or somebody else you needed?

00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,660
You're 15. You're smart.

566
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,861
You don't have...
I am not that smart.

567
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,474
I am that beautiful.

if I give you an epidural,

574
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,937
you won't be able
to feel when to push.
You're not funny.

I'm pretty sure I am.

because you're in pain.

get off your ass
and help me...

I did.

Did she have hair?
What are you getting at?

584
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,559
Right now I'm getting at
whether or not
she had hair down there.

585
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,197
Not much.
She's manipulative,
yet completely docile.

586
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,505
Everybody tells us that
outburst on the catwalk
was out of character.

587

She's never had a period.

this is hormonal?

she's the ultimate woman.

Because we changed
your medicine back
to the real stuff.

vain hope that you wouldn't
feel the need to also say it.

Wilson already did
an ultrasound. He said
her ovaries were undersized.

the way to go if you were

Yep.

Technically, no.
So it's not cancer?

About an hour
after you solved the case?

646
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,492
If I wanted to be
psychoanalyzed, I'd get
Wilson to give me the shot.

647
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,269
Same dosage?

648
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,372
If you'd be
more comfortable,

649
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:21,240
I might be able to deal with
a few Iess cc's of morphine.

650
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,945
It wasn't morphine.

651
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,080
What did you give me?
I told you I wanted...

652
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,483
It was saline.

653
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,415
I gave you a placebo.
