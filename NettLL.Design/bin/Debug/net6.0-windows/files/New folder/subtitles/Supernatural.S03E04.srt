1
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:02,003
Look, dad's gone now.

2
00:00:02,038 --> 00:00:04,020
We have to carry out his legacy.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,505
And that means hunting down
as many evil sons of bitches

4
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:08,206
as we possibly can.

5
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:14,324
What the hell
just happened?

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,233
That's a devil's gate,
a damn door to hell!

7
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:19,483
How certain are you

8
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:24,026
that what you brought back
is 100% pure Sam?

9
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:30,055
Just tell me who you are.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,893
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:33,549
Just tell me who you are!

12
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:35,055
You're a demon.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,598
I want to help you from time to time.

14
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:37,838
Why would you want to help me?

15
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:39,160
I could help you save your brother.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,764
Back in 1835,
Samuel Colt made a special gun.

17
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,707
This gun can kill anything.

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,000
One more.

19
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:39,270
That's all for tonight, sister.

20
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:41,654
Come on.
Let me walk you to your car.

21
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:44,802
Father?

22
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:47,318
Andy?

23
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,068
Father, God's not with us.

24
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,700
Not anymore.

25
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,273
Andy, of course he is.

26
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:57,360
Why would you say that?
What's wrong?

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,643
He can't help us.

28
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,328
And if he can...

29
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,078
He won't.

30
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,152
Andy, wait!

31
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,130
Hey, what's up?

32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Might have found
some omens in ohio.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
Dry lightning.
Barometric-pressure drop.

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,530
Well, that's thrilling.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,200
Plus, some guy blows
his head off in a church

36
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,660
and another goes postal in a hobby shop

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,830
before the cops take him out.

38
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,660
Might be demonic omens.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,800
Or just a suicide and a
psycho scrapbooker.

40
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,400
But it's our best lead sinclincoln.

41
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,730
Where in ohio? Elizabethville.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,100
It's a half-dead factory
town in the rust belt.

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,930
There's got to be a demon
or two in south beach.

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,330
Sorry, hef. Maybe next time.

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,700
How's it going, bobby?

46
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,360
Slow.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,330
I tell you, it's a little sad
seeing the colt like that.

48
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,030
The only thing it's good for now
is figuring out what makes it tick.

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,330
So what makes it tick?

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,730
So, if we want to go check
out these omens in ohio,

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,900
you think you can have that thing
ready by this afternoon?

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,160
Well, it won't kill demons by then,

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
but i can promise you it'll kill you.

54
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,860
All right. Come on,
we're wasting the daylight.

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,730
- See you, Bobby.
- Hey.

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,600
You boys run into anything... anything... you call me.

57
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,160
There's not much left for the insurance company.

58
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,560
It was a suicide.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,830
I saw it myself.

60
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,530
Well, this shouldn't take long, then.

61
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,730
That's where andy did it.

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,030
It's the first time i'd seen him in weeks.

63
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,630
He used to come every sunday.

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,730
When did he stop?

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,060
Probably about two months ago

66
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,060
right around the time everything
else started to change.

67
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,160
Change how?

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,100
Let's just say this used to be a town
you could be proud of.

69
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,730
People... cared about each other.

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,430
Andy sang in the choir,

71
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,360
and then one day,
he just wasn't andy anymore.

72
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,260
It was like he was...

73
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,160
possessed?

74
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,900
You could say that.

75
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,060
Gambled away his money,
cheated on his wife,

76
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,900
destroyed his business.

77
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,660
Yes.

78
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,500
Like a switch had flipped.

79
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,930
Father, did you know the man

80
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,830
who killed those folks in the hobby shop?

81
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,500
Sure, tony perkins. Tony perkins.

82
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,200
Good man.

83
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,100
Would you say that his personality

84
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,960
suddenly changed one day, too?

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
I never thought about it that way, but... yes.

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,030
About the same time as andy
- about two months ago.

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,400
Well, thank you, father.
Appreciate your time.

88
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,900
Two months ago,
we open up the devil's gate,

89
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,300
all of a sudden this town
turns into margaritaville?

90
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,630
It's no coincidence.

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,930
Richie.

92
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,360
I don't believe it.

93
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,300
Hey. Dean... winchester, right?

94
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,860
This is my sister, uh, cheryl.

95
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,630
Hi, cheryl.

96
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,630
There.

97
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,730
Well, you know... stepsister.

98
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,330
Come on in.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,630
This is my brother, sam.

100
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,430
Hey. How you doing? Not too bad.

101
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,930
How do you two know each other?

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,230
You were in school.

103
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,930
It was that succubus, right?

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,430
Yeah, yeah. Oh, man.

105
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,330
You should have seen the
rack on this broad.

106
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,930
Freakin' tragedy when
i had to ganch her.

107
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,060
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Who killed her?

108
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,860
If i remember, your ass was
toast until i showed up.

109
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,930
Oh, i forgot what a
comedian this guy was.

110
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,130
I told you then. I'll tell you again.

111
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,400
You're not cut out for this job.

112
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,730
You're gonna get yourself killed.

113
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,630
Talk to me.

114
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,360
Fyi, winchester... words hurt. Yeah.

115
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,360
No, it's not a good time, baby.

116
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
Later.

117
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,860
You find anything in this town, anyway?

118
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Uh, no. I got nothing.

119
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,200
Oh, wait a minute. You mean as
in demons and whatnot?

120
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,260
Yeah.

121
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,700
No, i got nothing. Typical.

122
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,100
What about your sister back there?

123
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,660
Honestly, she definitely had the devil in her,

124
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,030
but she wasn't no demon,
you know what i'm saying?

125
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,860
Right. Seriously.

126
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,630
Church guy, hobby-shop guy...

127
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,530
they were lunch meat
by the time i got there.

128
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,530
Maybe they were possessed,
but i can't prove it.

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,430
Yeah, that's where we are, too.

130
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,260
Let's just say the demons are
possessing people in this town.

131
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,260
You know, raising hell.

132
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,200
But why would a demon
blow his brains out?

133
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,300
For fun? He wrecks one body,
moves to another.

134
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,130
Like taking a stolen car for a joyride.

135
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,660
Anybody else that fits the profile...

136
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,860
nice guy turned douche that's still breathing?

137
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,500
There's trotter. Who's that?

138
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,200
He used to be head of the rotary club.

139
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,030
Then he turned bastard all of a sudden.

140
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,560
Brought in the gambling, the hookers.

141
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,130
He practically owns this whole town.

142
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,230
Know where we could find him?

143
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,500
He'll be at his bar in a few hours.

144
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,160
I thought you said this was some
boarded-up factory town.

145
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,330
It is.

146
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,600
At least, it's supposed to be.

147
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,230
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's do some research.

148
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,030
- Oh, richie. Look at you.
- Hey.

149
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,060
- Bringing satin back.
- Oh, you like this?

150
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,300
Try thai silk... canal street.

151
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,130
You have to pay $300 for
threads like these, easy.

152
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,400
Cost to me... forget about it.

153
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,730
How much is "forget about it"?

154
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,800
Ah, forget about it.
That's trotter over there.

155
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,200
He sits there all night.
Can't touch him.

156
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,430
So, what do we do now?

157
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,500
I don't know about you guys,
but i'm gonna do

158
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,460
a little investigating with that bartender.

159
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,130
Easy. Me and her, we got a little
somethin'-somethin' lined up for later.

160
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,630
Yeah, right.

161
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,100
Stings, don't it?

162
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,260
All right. I got to hit the head.

163
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,360
Release the hostages.

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,730
Be back in a few.

165
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,330
No way he gets a girl like that.
I mean, look at her.

166
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,860
You could fit that ass on a nickel.

167
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,600
You think so?

168
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,760
Oh. Sorry, padre.

169
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,300
Knew you boys would find your way here.

170
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,960
They all do.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,130
No offense, but what are you
doing here, father?

172
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,860
Like it or not, you go where your flock is.

173
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,360
- Plus, the clergy drinks for free. - true.

174
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,260
And a certain bartender owes
me a confession.

175
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,760
Not in this lifetime, father.

176
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,130
I better see your butt on sunday.

177
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,100
Nickel or no nickel.

178
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,700
What can i get you boys?

179
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,060
What's your speciality?

180
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,630
I make a mean hurricane.

181
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,300
I guess we'll see about that.

182
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,230
You drink hurricanes?

183
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,630
I do now.

184
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,130
Hi, john.

185
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,100
Reggie. Everything okay with you?

186
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,360
I don't know.

187
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,130
I'm just not feeling myself today.

188
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,130
Hey, what are you doing?!

189
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,100
He slept with my wife.

190
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,260
That bastard slept with my wife!

191
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,160
Somebody call 911!

192
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,100
Too many cops here. I say we roll.

193
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,330
Just be cool.

194
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,560
Poor jerk. Only thing possessing
him was a sixer of pabst.

195
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,900
So, what's the deal, then?

196
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,160
People in this town getting
possessed or not?

197
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,960
I don't know. Maybe it is just what it is...

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,430
town full of scumbags.

199
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,960
Yeah. Maybe.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,230
You boys ready for your mug shots?

201
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,100
The photographer's gonna be here in a few

202
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,030
and take your picture for the local paper.

203
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,600
Be an honor, officer. What a thrill.

204
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,200
Yep, time to go.

205
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,030
Wait a second. Wait a second.

206
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,260
What?

207
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,800
Where's richie?

208
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,360
So, how's a bartender afford a place like this?

209
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,930
My parents left it to me.

210
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,400
I don't come out here much...

211
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,330
mostly when i want to be alone.

212
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,260
Wow. This is, uh, charming.

213
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,100
You sure you wouldn't be more comfortable

214
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,400
in a bedroom or my motel room?

215
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,300
I mean, not for nothing, but,
you know, i got oils.

216
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,860
But i have toys.

217
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,930
Yeah, no. Toys trump oils.

218
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,230
You don't get, uh, scared down
here all by yourself?

219
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,630
Of course not.

220
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,300
Not when i've got a hunter to protect me.

221
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,423
Thanks.

222
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,810
You do realize there's red meat

223
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,010
within striking distance, right?

224
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,480
How many times i got to tell richie

225
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,950
he's gonna get himself in trouble?

226
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,180
Dean, you're assuming he's missing.

227
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,980
I mean, maybe he just bailed.

228
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,080
He's a moron.

229
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,250
He's a sweet moron,
but he's not a coward.

230
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,480
He wouldn't just bail. I got to go find him.

231
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,910
Meanwhile, i think i'm
gonna trail this trotter guy.

232
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,180
Yeah?

233
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,050
I don't know. Something about the
way he looked at me last night.

234
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,550
Maybe there is something going on here.

235
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,250
Cute piece.

236
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,950
Who are you?

237
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,850
It won't stop a demon,
if that's what you think.

238
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
How the hell would you know?

239
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,410
Oh, i don't know.

240
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,210
Call it an educated guess.

241
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,050
Well, ain't i lucky, then?

242
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,380
Found a subject for a test fire.

243
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,650
Luck has nothing to do with it.

244
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,110
But, hey, by all means.

245
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,010
Take your best shot.

246
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,710
Are you gonna stand
there like a pantywaist,

247
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,950
or are you gonna shoot me?!

248
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,580
That smarts a little.

249
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,880
What do you want?

250
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,710
Peace on earth.

251
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,250
A new shirt.

252
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,410
Now... do you want me to help
you out with that gun or not?

253
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,850
- Dean.
- Sammy.

254
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,110
- Yeah. Hey. I can't talk right now.
- You okay?

255
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,550
Yeah, i'm fine.

256
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Just meet me at the bar
in 20 minutes, okay?

257
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,950
Sam!

258
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,080
I got to tell you...

259
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,410
every woman in this place
- they want to eat you up.

260
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,650
Anybody could have tackled that guy

261
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,350
and wrestled the gun away...
prevented mass murder.

262
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,550
Here's what i'm gonna do.

263
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,680
Normally, i charge $400 a night.

264
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,850
Why don't we call it an even deuce

265
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,350
and get the hell out of here?

266
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,710
What do i look like?

267
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,910
What do i look like?

268
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,950
Cheapskate.

269
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,350
Did i just see you strike out with a prostitute?

270
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,650
How's that work?

271
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,580
I just told her i had a thing for the bartender.

272
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,710
It was pretty easy.

273
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,580
Who says the bartender's available?

274
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,280
That's a good question.

275
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,410
You got something going with
some guy about yea tall,

276
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,880
wears a sweat suit? Who?

277
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,350
No. My mistake.

278
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,010
What do you say you and me grab
a drink after your shift?

279
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,980
I say why wait...
when we can go right now?

280
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,080
What are you doing here?

281
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,750
I think maybe you know. Yeah?

282
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,050
Well, i think i'm calling the cops.

283
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,150
Cops?

284
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,910
Breaking and entering, assault...

285
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,950
you're in a peck of trouble, my friend.

286
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,050
Uh, well, i think i could probably explain it!

287
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,650
All right, back up!

288
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,010
Get back. Money's in the safe!
Take it and go.

289
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,910
I don't want your money.

290
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,080
I just got to be sure.

291
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,550
What kind of psycho are you?

292
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,950
Oh, god.

293
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,780
Uh, i'm sorry.

294
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,210
I think this was just a minor
misunderstanding?

295
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,610
How 'bout i just leave, cause...

296
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,580
you know, i'll take these.

297
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,380
I'll, uh, i'll leave this for, uh...

298
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,550
you, uh... have a nice day?

299
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,650
Looks like the maid's day off.

300
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,350
Everything okay?

301
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,580
Make yourself comfortable.

302
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,010
Oh, i forgot to mention...

303
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,410
richie was a friend of mine.

304
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,980
When i realized i could track the
GPS in his cellphone,

305
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,410
i swung by earlier.

306
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,450
Give him a proper burial.

307
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,780
It's better than rotting in
some skank's basement.

308
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,750
Whoops.

309
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,550
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

310
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,110
Isn't that a buzz kill?

311
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,110
Sorry, sister,

312
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,650
but you're going back to where you came from.

313
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,680
I don't think so.

314
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,510
What are you laughing at, bitch?

315
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,880
You're still trapped.

316
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,080
So are you... bitch.

317
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,410
Lose something?

318
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,540
All you demons have
such smart mouths.

319
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,610
It's a gift.

320
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,740
Well, let's see if you're smiling

321
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,440
when i send your ass back to hell.

322
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,110
Without your little exorcism book?

323
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,270
Hey, go ahead.

324
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,810
Having a little trouble there, sport?

325
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,670
Nice try, but i think you just
ordered a pizza.

326
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,670
I guess you should have paid
more attention in latin class.

327
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,370
I don't know what you're smiling about.

328
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,510
You're not going anywhere.

329
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,810
And, apparently, neither are you.

330
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,970
Yeah, but i got somebody
coming for me, and, uh...

331
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,710
he did pay attention in class.

332
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,510
Oh, right... sam.

333
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,940
Everyone says he's the brains of the outfit.

334
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,010
- Everyone? - sure.

335
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
You winchester boys are famous.

336
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,710
Not lohan famous, but, you know...

337
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,940
well, that's flattering.

338
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,970
I'll be sure to let sam know when he gets here.

339
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,040
If he shows up first.

340
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,870
What, you thought i was flying solo?

341
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,170
You shouldn't underestimate, dean.

342
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,310
It might be the death of you.

343
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,440
You can give me hard eyes all you want,

344
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,670
but the fact remains,

345
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,340
we just have to wait and
see who shows up first...

346
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,470
the cavalry or the indians.

347
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,470
You look kind of tense.

348
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:45,010
You know, i know a surefire way to relax.

349
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,610
Maybe later.

350
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,640
Excuse me.

351
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,210
What can i get for you?

352
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,340
Um, you remember the guy
i was with last night?

353
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,970
We sat right here.

354
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,410
The big hero who jumped on reggie.

355
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,270
Yeah, yeah. The... the big hero. Right.

356
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,240
Um, have you seen him around at all today?

357
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,370
Maybe. Depends.

358
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,040
D-depends on what?

359
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,240
Oh, my...

360
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,470
does everyone around here
have their hand out?

361
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,270
He left with casey about an hour ago.

362
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,010
Any idea where they went?

363
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,870
Her place... for bible study.

364
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,840
- You got an address?
- What's wrong with you?

365
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,870
You think i'm gonna give you a co-worker's address

366
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,170
just so you can go over there

367
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,910
and get your freaky peeping-tom rocks off?

368
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,940
Corner of piermont and clinton.

369
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,570
Have fun.

370
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,560
Why don't you relax?

371
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,920
Why don't you kiss my ass?

372
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,020
Why, dean, you're a poet. I had no idea.

373
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,520
Look, we won't have any
effect on the outcome of this.

374
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,860
We might as well be civil.

375
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,120
Civil, huh?

376
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,260
Killing richie... that was civil?

377
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,690
The guy was harmless.

378
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,590
That knife he pulled on me
didn't look so harmless.

379
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,090
A knife wouldn't hurt you.

380
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,660
No, but it would damage this body.

381
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,220
And casey has such a fine body,

382
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,520
i wouldn't want to see it ripped.

383
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,690
A demon with a heart. Wow.

384
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,390
Well, you know, there's a
bunch of dead people in town

385
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,620
that might disagree with you.

386
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,190
Hey, i didn't pull any triggers.

387
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,890
Yeah, you did something.

388
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,520
You want to know what i did
- what i really did?

389
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,860
I had lunch.

390
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,790
- Lunch? - me and trotter.

391
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,920
He had a cheeseburger, i had a salad,

392
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,320
and i just pointed out the
money that could be made

393
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,390
with a few businesses that
cater to harmless vice.

394
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,820
So trotter built it, and, man,
did they come.

395
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,360
Supposedly god-fearing folk,

396
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,120
waist-deep in booze, sex, gambling.

397
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,920
I barely lifted a finger.

398
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,760
- That's it?
- You don't get it.

399
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,460
All you got to do is nudge
humans in the right direction.

400
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,020
Some whiskey here, a hooker there,

401
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,860
and they'll walk right into hell

402
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,790
with big, fat smiles on their faces.

403
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,160
Your kind is corrupt, dean. Weak.

404
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,820
Our will's stronger. That's why we'll win.

405
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,660
And that's how it ends?

406
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,520
No.

407
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,160
That's how it begins.

408
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,190
Dean?

409
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,020
Sulfur.

410
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,160
So, demons take over.

411
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,060
I thought the meek shall inherit the earth.

412
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,090
Oh, according to your bible.

413
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,260
It's only a book, dean.

414
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,790
Not everyone would agree.

415
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,260
Because it's god's book?

416
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,820
Do you believe in god, dean?

417
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,260
I'd be surprised if you did.

418
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,120
I don't know. I'd like to.

419
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,420
Well, i don't see how you and your god

420
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,290
have done such a bang-up job.

421
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,160
War, genocide
- it's only getting worse.

422
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,760
This past century,

423
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:32,160
you people racked up a body
count that amazed even us.

424
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,120
It's our turn now,

425
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,890
and we're gonna do it right this time.

426
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,860
Don't be hopeful, dean.

427
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,790
You're not delivered.

428
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,560
It's only the wind.

429
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,160
Bobby, it's sam. We got a big problem.

430
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,320
I found some sulfur,
and now i can't find dean.

431
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,720
Call me as soon as you get this.

432
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,420
Hey, excuse me. They weren't there.

433
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,820
I guess you got to catch
your jollies another night.

434
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,060
Here. Why don't you have a drink and relax?

435
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,920
I don't want to relax.

436
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,820
What is it with the people in this town?

437
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,060
Suit yourself, princess.

438
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,620
Father.

439
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,820
Yes?

440
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,720
Um... can i talk to you for a sec?

441
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,820
You're piling it pretty high there, sweetheart.

442
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,890
I'm not sure i'm buying.

443
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,960
Why would i lie?

444
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,060
Demons lie.

445
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,060
Some do.

446
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,390
Some are true believers.

447
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,620
Believers in what?

448
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,020
You think humans have an
exclusive on a higher power?

449
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,990
You have a god?

450
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,690
Sure. His name's lucifer.

451
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
You mean the devil?

452
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,720
Your word, not ours.

453
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,620
Lucifer actually means "light bringer."

454
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,920
Look it up.

455
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,120
Once he was the most beautiful
of all god's angels.

456
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,590
But god demanded that he
bow down before man,

457
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,720
and when he refused,
god banished him.

458
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Tell me, dean.

459
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,160
How do you like bowing
before lesser creatures?

460
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,690
Lucifer's really real?

461
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,420
Well, no one's actually seen him,

462
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,520
but they say that he made us into what we are,

463
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,020
and they say that he'll return.

464
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,560
Oh, yeah? And, uh, you believe that?

465
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,790
I've got faith.

466
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,420
So, you see?

467
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,420
Is my kind really all that different than yours?

468
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,660
Well, except that, uh, demons are evil.

469
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,220
And humans are such a lovable bunch.

470
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,290
Dick cheney.

471
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,890
- He one of yours? - not yet.

472
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,460
Let's just say he's got a parking
spot reserved for him downstairs.

473
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,560
.
Hey, speaking of downstairs...

474
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,960
what's it like down there?

475
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,190
What, hell?

476
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,620
Yeah.

477
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,820
That's right.

478
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,660
You booked a one-way ticket with that deal.

479
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,890
You're not gonna like it, dean.

480
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,360
And, um, judging from the trouble you've caused,

481
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,060
i don't think you'll be getting the presidential suite.

482
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,660
No, it's a pit of despair.

483
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,260
Why do you think we want to come here?

484
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,790
So, the... the bartender the other night, casey,

485
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,590
you know her pretty well?

486
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,960
Since she was in pigtails.

487
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:19,260
Well, um, she and my brother, they, uh...

488
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,720
they... left tonight.

489
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,190
Together.

490
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,920
Well, not that i approve,
but they are consenting adults.

491
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Right.

492
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,890
I'm sorry. You said "brother."

493
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,690
I thought you were insurance investigators.

494
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,320
Right, right. Well, we are.

495
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,420
Um, it's like a family business, you know?

496
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,220
Anyways, um, so, i went to casey's apartment,

497
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,690
and they weren't there.

498
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,760
Um, i just have this feeling that they...

499
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,520
that they might be in trouble.

500
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,060
What kind of trouble?

501
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,160
Just trouble.

502
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,260
Please, father, i need your help.

503
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,020
Is there anything you
could tell me about casey...

504
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,360
anyplace she'd go, maybe?

505
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,490
Yes, there is a place.
Let me get my jacket.

506
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,760
No, wait, father. I can do this by myself.

507
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,490
Son, if casey's really in trouble,

508
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,290
then there's nothing to talk about.

509
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,720
Shall we go?

510
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,880
Kind of funny, don't you think?

511
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,320
You and me sitting here like
a couple of regular folk.

512
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,920
It's hilarious...

513
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,350
you know, in that apocalyptic sort of way.

514
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,920
You're all right, dean.

515
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,020
The others don't describe you that way.

516
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,920
But, you know, you're... you're likable.

517
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,450
A demon likes me.

518
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,380
Sorry, i don't know how to respond to that.

519
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,780
You could say thanks.

520
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,520
That deal you made to save sam...

521
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,120
a lot of others would mock you for it,

522
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,480
think it was weak or stupid.

523
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,820
I don't.

524
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,250
It's been kind of liberating, actually.

525
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,380
What's the point in worrying about a future

526
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,280
when you don't have one, huh?

527
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,580
Still, a year left.

528
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,880
You're not scared?

529
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,520
Not even a little?

530
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,120
Of course not.

531
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,180
So, insurance investigating.

532
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,250
You enjoy the work?

533
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,650
Yeah.

534
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,320
Yeah, i... like being able to help people.

535
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,820
Ever think about doing anything else?

536
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,050
Like what?

537
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,320
Mmm, anything.

538
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,880
You seem like a pretty smart kid.

539
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,420
Somehow i see you out in front of the pack.

540
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,450
You could do some great things.

541
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,920
I don't know.

542
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,950
I like doing what i'm doing, i guess.

543
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,380
Well, it's your life.

544
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,650
Does, um...

545
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
dean?

546
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,880
Yeah, dean.

547
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,320
Does he find trouble often?

548
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,250
Yeah yeah, dean finds his fair share.

549
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,150
Well, it's a good thing he has you...

550
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,250
his brother's keeper.

551
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,650
Why, dean, if i didn't know better,

552
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,220
i'd say that was lust in your eyes.

553
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,480
Well, it would be one
way to spend the time.

554
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,380
But i don't think you'd
respect me in the morning.

555
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,820
That's okay.

556
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,550
I mean, hey, i barely respect you now.

557
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,650
Hey, can i ask you a question?

558
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,020
I'm an open book.

559
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,320
So, the gate opened.
The demon army was let out.

560
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,280
What now, huh?

561
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,420
I'm not seeing a big, honking plan here.

562
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,620
Honestly, there was a plan.

563
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,650
Azazel was a tyrant,

564
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,980
but he held us all together.

565
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,220
Azazel?

566
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,220
You think his friends
just called him yellow eyes?

567
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,050
He had a name.

568
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,550
After you did him in, it all fell apart.

569
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,050
Sorry about that.

570
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,680
So, what? No chain of command?

571
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,180
There was.

572
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,520
It was sam.

573
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,650
Sam was supposed to
be the grand pooh-bah

574
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,320
and lead the big army,

575
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,380
but he hasn't exactly
stepped up to the plate, has he?

576
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,350
Thank god for that.

577
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,880
Again with god.

578
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,180
You think this is a good thing?

579
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,850
Now you've got chaos,

580
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,320
a war without a front,

581
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,220
hundreds of demons all
jockeying for power,

582
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,320
all fighting for the crown...

583
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,580
most of them gunning for your brother.

584
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,820
For the record,
i was ready to follow sam.

585
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,280
Dean?!

586
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,250
Looks like you win

587
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,550
dean!

588
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,750
Check that way

589
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,480
sam!

590
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,620
Dean?

591
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,750
Sammy, down here!
The basement caved in!

592
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,620
Dean. Hey, hold on, okay?
We're coming.

593
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,350
- Who's we?
- I'm here with the father.

594
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,950
Sammy, be careful.

595
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,580
- Bobby, you all right? - yeah.

596
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,050
How did you know where we...

597
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,880
go.

598
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,750
You heard the man. Go.

599
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,550
Stop!

600
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,980
You two?

601
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,550
For centuries.

602
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,880
We've been to hell and back, literally.

603
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
Leave him be.

604
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,780
Don't kill him. Let's just go.

605
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,120
Please.

606
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,480
Sam, wait!

607
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,160
Well, what do you think, bobby?

608
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,020
What we did here,
you think it made a difference?

609
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,260
Two less demons to worry about.

610
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,560
That's not nothing

611
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,290
but trotter's still alive.

612
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,660
Humans ain't our job.

613
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,390
Yeah, but you think
anything's really gonna change?

614
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,560
Maybe these people do just
want to really destroy themselves.

615
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,660
Maybe it is a losing battle.

616
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,290
Is that you or the demon girl talking?

617
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,190
Oh, it's me.

618
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,520
Demon is dead, and so is that
hot girl it was possessing.

619
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,690
Well, had to be done.
Sam was saving your life.

620
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,090
Yeah, but you didn't see it,
bobby. It was cold.

621
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,590
Bobby.

622
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,920
Yeah?

623
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,860
Back in wyoming,

624
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,890
uh, there was this moment

625
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,160
yellow eyes said something to me.

626
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,060
What did he say?

627
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,590
That maybe when sam came back

628
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,520
from wherever that...

629
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,860
maybe he came back different.

630
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,520
- Different how? - i don't know.

631
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,420
Whatever it was, it didn't sound good.

632
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,660
You think...

633
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,720
think something's wrong with my brother?

634
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,390
No.

635
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,720
Demons lie.

636
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,820
I'm sure sam's okay.

637
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,260
Yeah.

638
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,620
Yeah, me too.

639
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,690
Leaving so soon?

640
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,290
We haven't even had
a chance to celebrate.

641
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,920
Yeah, well, you can celebrate without me.

642
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,020
You're not gonna get all
pouty on me now, are you?

643
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,360
Come on!

644
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,760
You killed two demons today.

645
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,290
Yeah, well, maybe you don't care,

646
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,860
but i killed two humans, too.

647
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,260
Sam, you know what happens
when demons piggyback humans.

648
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,490
Chances are those two would
have died a slow, sticky death.

649
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,160
You probably did them a favor.

650
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,720
Did them a favor?

651
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,020
You're a cold bitch, you know that?

652
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,560
Yeah, and this cold bitch.

653
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,890
Has saved your ass a couple of times now.

654
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,590
Some respect might be nice.

655
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,460
Especially if you want me to help you out...

656
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,020
with dean and his little problem.

657
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,990
You know what?
You keep dangling that,

658
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,360
but last i checked,
dean's still going to hell.

659
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,260
Everything in its own time, sam.

660
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,060
- We're in a war. - right.

661
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,190
But for some reason,
you're fighting on our team.

662
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,660
Now, tell me, why is that again?

663
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,020
Go screw yourself. That's why.

664
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,890
I don't have to justify
my actions to you, sam.

665
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,320
If you don't want my help, fine.

666
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,390
Then give me the gun,

667
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,320
and i'll pass it on to
someone who will use it.

668
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,760
Maybe i'll just use it on you.

669
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,060
Go ahead, if that makes you happy.

670
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,460
It's not gonna do
much for dean, though.

671
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,290
So, what's it gonna be?

672
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,160
That's my boy.

673
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,490
This won't be easy, sam.

674
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,990
You're gonna have to do things

675
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,390
that go against that
gentle nature of yours.

676
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,660
There'll be collateral damage...

677
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,320
but, it has to be done.

678
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,760
Well, i don't have to like it.

679
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,790
No.

680
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,860
You wouldn't be sam if you did.

681
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,960
On the bright side,
i'll be there with you

682
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,360
that little fall angel

683
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,360
on your shoulder.
