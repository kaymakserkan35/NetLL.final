1
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,700
i know about sam's visions. i know everything.

2
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,530
gordon should be reaching for the soap

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,360
for the next few years,at least.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,500
you were right about everything.

5
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,900
sam winchester is more than a monster.

6
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,660
i'm not even sure he's human.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,500
we got to get me the hell out of here.

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,200
it's rude to sneak up on people.

9
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,860
bela talbot.

10
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,430
you have me at a disadvantage.

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,400
i don't know who you are.

12
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,230
gordon walker.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,830
i've heard of you.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,760
heard you were in prison.

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,100
got out.

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,330
released early on good behavior?

17
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,760
you looking for this?

18
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,100
i know you were just in massachusetts,

19
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,300
and i know you were with the winchester boys.

20
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,830
tell me where they are.

21
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,530
i don't think i know.

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,960
why don't you think a little harder?

23
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,090
put that down.

24
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,430
what's so pressing about finding the boys,anyway?

25
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,500
sam winchester's the antichrist.

26
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,800
i'd heard something about that... it's true.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,430
...from my good friend,the easter bunny,

28
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,530
who'd heard it from the tooth fairy.

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
are you off your meds?

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,630
the world hangs in the balance.

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,990
so you go ahead and be a smart-ass,

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,860
but tell me where they are,or i shoot.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,930
gordon,you and i don't know each other very well,

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,830
so let me tell you a little something about me.

35
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,930
i don't respond well to threats,

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,500
but you make me an offer,

37
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,330
and i think you'll find me highly cooperative.

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,290
okay.

39
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,530
how about...

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,700
you tell me where they are,or i kill you right now?

41
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,090
kill me.

42
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,800
good luck finding sam and dean.

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,660
i can wrangle up three grand.

44
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,030
i don't get out of bed for three grand.

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,230
you...

46
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,730
scratch that.

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,360
give me the mojo bag,and we'll call it even.

48
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,860
oh,hell,no.

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,930
this thing's a century old. it's --

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,530
priceless.

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,860
believe me,i know.

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,360
now,how badly do you want the winchesters?

53
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,060
hello,dean?

54
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,160
hey,where are you?

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,500
supernatural season 3 episode 7
Flesh Blood

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,060
hey,hey. don't worry.

57
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,760
we're gonna call you some help,okay?

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,860
where is she? where'd she go?!

59
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,900
smell that?!

60
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,630
come and get it!

61
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,730
that's right.

62
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,230
come on.

63
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,990
i smell good,don't i?

64
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,500
i taste even better.

65
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,530
come on!

66
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,530
free lunch!

67
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,260
what?

68
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,180
cutting it a little close,don't you think?

69
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,480
ah,that's just chum in the water.

70
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,480
worked,didn't it?

71
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,380
you with us?

72
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,610
oh,yeah,sorry.

73
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,450
you're not going anywhere.

74
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,550
where's your nest? what?

75
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,550
nest -- where you and your bloodsucking pals hang out.

76
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,980
i don't know what you're talking about.

77
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,110
please!

78
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,450
i don't feel good.

79
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,150
yeah,well,you're gonna feel a hell of a lot worse

80
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,810
if we give you another shot of dead man's blood.

81
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,480
just let me go.

82
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,950
yeah,you know we can't do that.

83
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,750
i'm telling you the truth.

84
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,810
i'm just -- i took something.

85
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,280
i'm freaking out!

86
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,680
i don't know what's going on!

87
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,510
you took something? yes!

88
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,350
i can't...calm down.

89
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,850
i just want to calm down.

90
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,680
what's your name?

91
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,780
lucy.

92
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,910
please,just let me go.

93
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,250
all right,lucy,how about this?

94
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,310
if you tell us what happened,

95
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,980
we'll let you go.

96
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,210
you will?

97
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,650
uh,i don't really...

98
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,650
um,it's not that clear.

99
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,880
i was at spider.

100
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,550
spider?

101
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,310
the club on jefferson.

102
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,680
and there was this guy -- he was buying me drinks.

103
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,110
this guy -- what's he look like?

104
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,050
he was old,like 30.

105
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,150
he had brown hair,a leather jacket --

106
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,180
deacon or dixon or something.

107
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,910
said he was a dealer -- he had something for me.

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,550
something? something new.

109
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,910
"better than anything you've ever tried."

110
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,150
he put a few drops in my drink.

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,650
was the drug red and thick?

112
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,010
well,genius move there.

113
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,180
that was vampire blood he dosed you with.

114
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,480
what?

115
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,880
you just took a big shot of the nastiest virus out there.

116
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,680
you're crazy!

117
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,180
he gave me roofies or something!

118
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,680
no...

119
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,080
the next thing i know,we're at his place,

120
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,050
and he says he's gonna get me something to eat,

121
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,750
just wait.

122
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,710
but i get so hungry.

123
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,050
so you busted out?

124
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,580
but it won't wear off...

125
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,280
whatever he gave me?

126
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,550
lights are too bright?

127
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,480
sunshine hurt your skin?

128
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,380
yeah...

129
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,710
and smells.

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,610
and i can... hear blood pumping.

131
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,280
i hate to tell you this,sweetheart,

132
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,050
but your blood's never pumping again.

133
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,150
not mine...

134
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,050
yours.

135
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,510
i can hear a heart beating from half a block away.

136
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,010
i just want it to stop.

137
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,250
it's not going to stop.

138
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,780
you've already killed two people -- almost three.

139
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,150
no,i couldn't.

140
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,410
-i was hallucinating!
-you killed them,all right?

141
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,250
we've been following a sloppy trail of corpses,

142
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,950
and it leads straight to you.

143
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,610
no. no,it wasn't real!

144
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,810
it was the drug!

145
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,680
please!

146
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,210
please,you have to help me!

147
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,010
no,no.

148
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,480
poor girl.

149
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,250
we don't have a choice.

150
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,710
no...please!

151
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,810
sir,a few questions about the attack.

152
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,180
i already talked to the cops.

153
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,810
well,we're not cops. we're fbi.

154
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,150
fbi?

155
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,650
can you describe your attacker?

156
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,410
she was crazy.

157
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,250
she had that,uh,super-pcp strength,you know?

158
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,710
she gnawed on my neck.

159
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,910
and did she bleed on you?

160
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,350
on me,no.

161
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,550
in your mouth,open wound,anything?

162
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,980
-you sure about that?  -yeah,i'm sure. why?

163
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,850
this woman has a very dangerous virus.

164
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,650
what? she bit me in the neck.

165
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,880
the bite doesn't matter.

166
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,810
you have to actually ingest the blood to be infected.

167
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,450
good thing,too. we'd have had to kill you.

168
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,050
the attack?

169
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,980
she jumped me,then bit me.

170
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,710
then those two guys found me and chased her down the alley.

171
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,180
-what did they look like?
-i didn't get a good look.

172
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,380
think.

173
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,810
one of them was real tall.

174
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,410
that was a big,fat waste of time.

175
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,480
look,three blondes have gone missing,including lucy --

176
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,650
all last sighted here.

177
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,380
i'm telling you,dean,this is the hunting ground.

178
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,850
you're sick.

179
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,680
you ready,sweetie?

180
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,210
one taste of this,you'll never be the same.

181
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,510
get out of here. go! go!

182
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,450
dean!

183
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,010
i'm good. come on.

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,300
all right. run. i'll draw them off.

185
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,070
what?! you're crazy!

186
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,970
there you are!

187
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,300
yeah.

188
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,300
sorry,i stopped for a slice.

189
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,270
nice move you pulled back there,dean --

190
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,840
running right at the weapons.

191
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,500
well,what can i say? i'm a bad-ass.

192
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,770
so,i guess gordon's out of jail.

193
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,370
uh,yeah,i guess so.

194
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,900
how the hell did he know where to find us?

195
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,770
that bitch.

196
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,700
-hi,bela. -hello,dean.

197
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,040
question for you.

198
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,570
when you called me yesterday,

199
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,640
it wasn't to thank me for saving your ass,was it?

200
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,540
gordon walker paid me to tell him where you were.

201
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,970
excuse me?

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,600
well,he had a gun on me. what else was i supposed to do?

203
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,540
i don't know,maybe pick up the phone

204
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,570
and tell us that a raging psychopath was dropping by!

205
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,400
i did fully intend to call.

206
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,370
-i just got a bit sidetracked.
-he tried to kill us!

207
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,440
i'm sorry. i didn't realize it was such big deal.

208
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,370
after all,there are two of you and one of him.

209
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,840
there were two of them.

210
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,840
bela,if we make it out of this alive,

211
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,500
the first thing i'm gonna do is kill you.

212
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,170
you're not serious.

213
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,840
listen to my voice and tell me if i'm serious.

214
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,540
i know you're uncomfortable...

215
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,170
but this is just temporary.

216
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,240
the hunger will pass,and then you'll feel much better.

217
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,400
-you're awake.
-who are they?

218
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,570
family.

219
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
you always keep your family in shackles?

220
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,440
we're still getting to know each other.

221
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,300
they've just been reborn.

222
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,370
you mean you grabbed some poor girls off the street

223
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,670
and made them monsters like you.

224
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,970
i do what i have to.

225
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
we're a dying breed.

226
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,240
but,then,you know that,don't you,gordon?

227
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,100
gordon walker...

228
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,340
one of the greatest living vampire hunters.

229
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,040
in the flesh.

230
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,940
you're a big part of why my people are nearly extinct.

231
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,940
your "people" are going extinct

232
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,970
because you're a bunch of mindless,bloodthirsty animals.

233
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,870
right.

234
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,170
we're so much more bloodthirsty than you.

235
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,040
hunters slaughtered my entire nest

236
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,140
like they were having a party --

237
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,270
murdered my daughter.

238
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,640
i can't tell you how satisfying this is --

239
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,640
catching a hunter responsible for so many deaths

240
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,070
and making you lunch for my new daughters.

241
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,140
"daughters?"

242
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
try "fang whores."

243
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
watch your mouth.

244
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,800
oh,did i hurt your feelings? i'm sorry.

245
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,100
i forgot you're just a misunderstood victim...

246
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,170
even though you murder and spread your filthy disease

247
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,070
on pure base instinct.

248
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,000
you got less humanity than a sewer rat.

249
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,000
i'm sorry you have such a low opinion of my people.

250
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,970
oh,you have no idea.

251
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,900
sorry,change of plans.

252
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,940
i'll be going out to get your lunch.

253
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,170
i've got a better idea for you.

254
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,040
no!

255
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,800
no!

256
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,500
no!!

257
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,140
that vampire's still out there,dean.

258
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,300
first things first.

259
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,640
gordon.

260
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,300
about that -- when we find him,or if he finds us...

261
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,270
i'm just saying he's not leaving us a whole lot of options.

262
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,240
yeah,i know. we've got to kill him.

263
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,740
really?

264
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,800
just like that?

265
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,000
i thought you would have been like,

266
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,500
"no,we can't. he's human. it's wrong."

267
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,240
no,i'm done.

268
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,900
gordon's not gonna stop until we're dead...

269
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,070
...or till he is.

270
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,840
what?!

271
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,940
i don't like it when people hold grudges against me,

272
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,100
and more to the point,i'd rather you didn't kill me,

273
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,440
so i went ahead and found gordon's exact location for you.

274
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,570
you're a hundred miles away. how the hell did you --

275
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,670
hello? purveyor of powerful occult objects?

276
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,000
i used a talking board to contact the other side.

277
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,500
-and?
-warehouse.

278
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,440
two stories,riverfront,neon sign outside.

279
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,640
thanks. one more thing --

280
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,040
the spirit had a message for you.

281
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,440
"leave town,run like hell,and whatever you do,

282
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,270
don't go after gordon."

283
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,270
for whatever that's worth

284
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,900
please   help us

285
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,170
please

286
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,570
go ahead

287
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,310
do it

288
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,640
kill me

289
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,340
what happened here?

290
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,370
gordon walker

291
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,340
i never should have brought a hunter here

292
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,540
never

293
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,040
i just

294
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,040
i just wanted some kind of revenge

295
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,170
stupid -- exposing him to my family

296
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,840
oh,yeah,you're such a family man

297
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,640
you don't understand

298
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,740
i don't want to understand,you son

299
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,310
i was desperate  you ever felt desperate?

300
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,840
i've lost everyone i ever loved

301
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,770
i'm staring down eternity alone

302
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,170
can you think of a worse hell?

303
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,170
well,there's hell

304
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,910
i wasn't thinking

305
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,910
i just

306
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,010
i didn't care anymore

307
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,740
do you know it's like

308
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,610
when you just don't give a damn?

309
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,940
it's like

310
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,140
it's like being dead already

311
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,010
so just go ahead

312
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,170
do it

313
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,010
dean

314
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,670
head wasn't cut off,it was ripped off

315
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,710
with someone's bare hands

316
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,340
Dixon,what did you do to gordon?

317
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,370
Gordon

318
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,110
you okay?

319
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,910
not even close

320
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,640
i thought maybe you were dead

321
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,110
what is it?

322
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,070
something   happened

323
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,440
what?

324
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,710
they turned me

325
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,070
those fangs?

326
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,240
I'm sorry

327
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,970
you know what this means

328
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,810
It means you have to kill me

329
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,770
but not yet

330
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,310
what do you mean?

331
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,940
you have to let me do one last thing first

332
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,840
what?

333
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,170
-kill sam winchester
-gordon

334
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,670
it's the only --

335
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,910
it is the one good thing to come out of this nightmare

336
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,810
gordon   i'm sorry

337
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,710
you know i can't let you walk out of here

338
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,370
listen to me

339
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:02,510
there is nothing more important

340
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,170
Please

341
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,310
i can do one last good thing for the world

342
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,440
yeah    i hear you

343
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,840
you know  gordon

344
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,940
you're right

345
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,570
one last good thing

346
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,340
i'm sorry

347
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,070
man,i must have checked three dozen motels,

348
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,840
empty buildings,warehouses

349
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,540
yeah,me too

350
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,070
big city

351
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,810
it's like a giant haystack and gordon's a deadly needle

352
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,940
we're running out of daylight

353
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,570
won't have the sun slowing him down

354
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,740
yeah,he'll be unstoppable

355
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,910
hey,give me your phone

356
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,570
what for?

357
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,870
well,if gordon knows our cell numbers

358
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,040
he can use the cell signal to track us down

359
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,040
oh,yeah  thanks

360
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,140
sammy,stay here

361
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,810
what? where you going now?

362
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,470
i'm going after gordon

363
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,870
what?

364
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,210
you heard me

365
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,640
not alone,you're not

366
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,740
sam,i don't need you to sign me a permission slip,okay?

367
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,340
he's after you,not me,and he's turbocharged

368
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,470
i want you to stay out of harm's way

369
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,710
i'll take care of it

370
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,770
you're not going by yourself  you're gonna get killed

371
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,470
just another day at the office

372
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,770
it's a massively dangerous day at the office

373
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,270
so you're the guy with nothing to lose now,huh?

374
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,140
oh,wait  let me guess  because,uh

375
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,570
it's because you're already dead,right?

376
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,110
-if the shoe fits
-you know what,man?

377
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,640
i'm sick and tired of your kamikaze trip

378
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,770
whoa,whoa  kamikaze?

379
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,670
i'm more like a ninja

380
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,240
-that's not funny
-it's a little funny

381
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,240
no,it's not

382
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,840
what do you want me to do,sam,huh --

383
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:42,270
sit around all day writing sad poems about how i'm gonna die?

384
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,940
you know what? i got one

385
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,870
let's see  what rhymes with "shut up,sam"?

386
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,070
dude    drop the attitude,dean

387
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,870
quit turning everything into a punch line

388
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,140
and you know something else?

389
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,940
stop trying to act like you're not afraid

390
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,610
-I'm not!
-You're lying

391
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,170
you may as well drop it 'cause i can see right through you

392
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,640
you got no idea what you're talking about

393
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,540
yeah,i do  you're scared,dean

394
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,840
you're scared because your year is running out

395
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,940
and you're still going to hell and you're freaked

396
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,870
-and how do you know that?
-because i know you!

397
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,070
really?

398
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,470
yeah,i've been following you around my entire life!

399
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,110
i mean,i've been looking up to you since i was four,dean --

400
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,270
studying you,trying to be just like my big brother

401
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,740
so,yeah,i know you --

402
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,470
better than anyone else in the entire world

403
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,870
and this

404
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,110
is exactly how you act when you're terrified

405
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,410
and,i mean,i can't blame you

406
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,440
it's just

407
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,270
what?

408
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,870
i wish you would drop the show and be my brother again

409
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,740
cause

410
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,770
just 'cause

411
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,170
all right,we'll hole up

412
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,170
cover our scent so he can't track us,

413
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,340
and wait the night out here

414
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,270
you've had that phone two hours,dean

415
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,770
who'd you give the number to?

416
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,470
nobody

417
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,370
-hello?
-dean

418
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,540
how'd you get this number?

419
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,770
your scent's all over the cellphone store

420
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,610
of course,i can't smell you now

421
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,410
-where are you?
-I guess you'll just have to find us

422
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,710
i'd rather you come to me  what's the matter,gordo?

423
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,570
you're not afraid of us,are you?

424
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,640
we're just sitting here  bring it on!

425
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,310
i don't think so

426
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,640
please

427
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,310
please

428
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,340

00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,640
factory on riverside off the turnpike.

430
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,770
be here in 20 minutes

431
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,410
or the girl dies.

432
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,740
-gordon,let the girl go.
-bye,dean.

433
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,840
gordon! don't do this.

434
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,070
you don't kill innocent people.

435
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,510
you're still a hunter.

436
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,970
no...

437
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,470
i'm a monster.

438
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,200
hey,we got you.

439
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,730
don't worry. we're gonna get you out of here.

440
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,500
get up. watch your head. watch your head.

441
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,130
sam,stay close.

442
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,800
-sam!
-dean!

443
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,330

444
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,500
gordon...

445
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,170
you got me where you want me.

446
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,070
you might as well come out and fight!

447
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,400
i'm right here,sam.

448
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,930
what's the matter,sammy?

449
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,400
so,this is really the way you want to do it,huh?

450
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,700
damn right i do.

451
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,770
you have no idea what i faced...

452
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,970
to get here.

453
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,100
i lost everything...

454
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,530
my life.

455
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:39,570
but it's worth it cause i'm finally gonna kill

456
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,070
the most dangerous thing i ever hunted.

457
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
you're not human,sam.

458
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,900
look who's talking.

459
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,360
you're right.

460
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,430
i'm a bloodthirsty killer.

461
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,000
-don't talk about it like you don't have a choice.
-i don't.

462
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,800
yes,you do,gordon.

463
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,130
you didn't kill that girl.

464
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,400
no,i didn't.

465
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:07,230
i did something much,much worse.

466
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,030
i got to hand it to you,sam.

467
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,670
you got a lot of people fooled,

468
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,070
but,see,i know the truth.

469
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,000
i know what it's like.

470
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,630
we're the same now,you and me.

471
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,000
i know how it is

472
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,000
walking around with something evil inside you.

473
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,070
it's just too bad you won't do the right thing

474
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,770
and kill yourself.

475
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,870
i'm gonna...

476
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,230
as soon as i'm done with you.

477
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,500
two last good deeds --

478
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,700
killing you...

479
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,630
and killing myself.

480
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,670
no!

481
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,330
you just charged a super-vamped-out gordon with no weapon.

482
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,200
that's a little reckless,don't you think?

483
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,030
-there you go.
-thanks.

484
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,360
figure out what's making that rattle?

485
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,500
not yet.

486
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,460
give me a box wrench,would you?

487
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,660
yeah.

488
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,160
-there you go.
-thanks.

489
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,230
sam.

490
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
-wrong one?
-no,come here for a second.

491
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,630
yeah.

492
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,500
this rattle could be a couple of things.

493
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,030
i'm thinking it's an out-of-tune car.

494
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,530
okay.

495
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,200
all right,see this thing?

496
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,700
it's a valve cover.

497
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,100
inside are all the parts that are on the head.

498
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,030
hand me that socket wrench.

499
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,700
all right,you with me so far?

500
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,360
yeah,uh,valve cover covers the heads.

501
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,700
very good.

502
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,800
this is your intake manifold,and on top of it?

503
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,160
it's,uh,a carburetor.

504
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,960
carburetor -- very good.

505
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,830
what's with the auto shop?

506
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,560
you don't mean you want --

507
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,460
yeah,i do.

508
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,960
you fix it.

509
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,960
dean,you barely let me drive this thing.

510
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,130
well,it's time. you should know how to fix it.

511
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,830
you're gonna need to know these things for the future.

512
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,030
and,besides,that's my job,right?

513
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,300
show my little brother the ropes.

514
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,960
put your shoulder into it.
