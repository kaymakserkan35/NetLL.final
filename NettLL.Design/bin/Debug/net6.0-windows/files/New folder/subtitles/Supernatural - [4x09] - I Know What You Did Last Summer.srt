1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,420
- who are you?
- Castiel. I'm an angel of the lord.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,300
The symbol you saw -- it's called
"the rising of the witnesses."

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,070
It figures into an ancient prophecy.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,560
What book is the prophecy from?

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,920
RevelationS.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,950
This is a sign, boys.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,540
A sign of what?

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,710
The apocalypse.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,070
Those seals are being brokenby lillith

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,590
I don't thinkI like you anymore.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,090
Think of the seals as locks on a door.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,500
Okay, the last one opens anD...

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,620
Lucifer walks free.

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,360
Tell me about those
months withouyour brother,

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,190
about all the things you and
this demon bitch do in the dark

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,380
Do you even know how far off
the reservation you've gone

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,590
how far from normal? From human?

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,760
Cas said that if i
don't stop you,he will.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,580
the raising of samhain
is one of the 66 seals.

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,860
The breaking of the seal must
be prevented at all costs.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,860
You were told not to use your abilities.

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,060
What was i supposed to do?

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,960
The only reason you're still alive,sam
winchester, is because you've been useful.

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,510
The second you become more trouble than
you're worth, then i will turn you to dust.

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,430
As for your brother, tell him that maybe
he should climb off that high horse of his.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,780
Ask dean what he rembers from hell.

27
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,030
anna?

28
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,890
Do you know where you are?

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,960
You're at the connor beverly
behavioral medicine center.

30
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,090
Do you know why you're here?

31
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,470
Do you rember what you did?

32
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,340
You were hysterical.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,990
It took four people to restrain you.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,410
I was trying to warn them.

35
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,610
Warn who?

36
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,420
Everyone.

37
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,980
Forget it. It was stupid.

38
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,670
What were you trying to warn them about?

39
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:34,300
Look... I get it. You think i'm nuts.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,090
If i were you, i'd think i was nuts.

41
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,490
But it's all true.

42
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,360
It's okay.

43
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,050
You can tell me.

44
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,770
I'm here to listen.

45
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,020
The end... Is coming.

46
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,140
The apocalypse.

47
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,830
The apocalypse. Like in the bible?

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,280
Kind of. I mean,same bottom line.

49
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,260
This demon,lillith, is trying to break
the 66 seals to free lucifer from hell.

50
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,130
Lucifer...

51
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,390
Will bring the apocalypse.

52
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,770
So...

53
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,080
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

54
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,710
Anna?

55
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
Sorry.

56
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,790
What were you doing?

57
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,500
Nothing.

58
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,250
Just listening.

59
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,430
So,you were saying that there
are,uh,66 of these seals in the world?

60
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,220
No. No.

61
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,950
There are about 600 possible seals,
and lilith only has to break 66 of them,

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,320
And no one knows which
66 she's gonna break.

63
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,230
I see.

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,580
That's why it's nearly
impossible to stop her.

65
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,450
And that's why the angels are losing.

66
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,700
That's why we're all gonna die.

67
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,970
Time for your meds,anna.

68
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,090
anna

69
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,180
What's the matter, sweetie?

70
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,860
Your face -- what
happened to your face?

71
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,600
I know.

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm downright kissable. Shh.

76
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,710
Brian,come on,man, just one more.

77
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,740
Just -- just give me a
chance to win it back.

78
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,160
It's your cash.

79
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,590
Excuse me.

80
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,030
My brother's a little
sauced to be making bets.

81
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,790
He insisted.

82
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,750
Yeah,but you've already taken,
what,two bills off him? I'm just saying.

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,480
Hey,shut up,dean. I'm fine.

84
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,240
No,you're not fine. You're drunk!

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,920
Let's make it $500.

86
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,360
$500?

87
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,040
Sure.

88
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,640
- 500
- Your break.

89
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,130
keep the money.

90
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,930
Keep the
money?What --

91
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,220
Well,you got a lot of nerve
showing up anywherenearme.

92
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,000
I just have some info,
and then i'm gone.

93
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,670
What is it?

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,900
I'm hearing a few whispers.

95
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,770
Ooh,great,demon whisperers
-- that's reliable.

96
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,730
Girl named anna milton escaped
from a locked ward yesterday.

97
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,210
The demons seem pretty
keen on finding her.

98
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,740
Apparently,some real heavy hitters
turned out for the easter-egg hunt.

99
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,840
Why? Who is she?

100
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,000
No idea.

101
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,690
But i'm thinking that she's important,
'cause the order is to capture her alive.

102
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,120
I just figured that whatever the deal is, you
might want to find this girl before the demons do.

103
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,920
Look,maybe weshould check it out.

104
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,020
Actually,we're working
a case,but thanks.

105
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,750
What case?

106
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,290
Uh,we've got leads, big leads.

107
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,310
Sounds dangerous.

108
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,920
Yeah,well,it sure ain't goosechasing
after some chick who,for all we know,

109
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,040
Doesn't even exist, just
because you say she's important.

110
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,260
I'm just delivering the news.

111
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,600
You can do whatever you want with it.

112
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,320
Far as i'm concerned,
i told you,i'm done.

113
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,850
Wait,wait,wait. This hospital
anna escaped from -- it got a name?

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Can i get a copy of the
missing-persons report?

115
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,380
Great. Okay. Thanks.

116
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,060
Well,anna milton's definitely real.

117
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,280
Don't mean the case is real.

118
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,990
And this hospital's a three-day drive.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,990
We've driven further for less,dean.

120
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,900
You got something to say, say it.

121
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,870
Oh,i'm saying
it -- this sucks.

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,200
You're not pissed we're
going after the girl.

123
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,760
You're pissed ruby threw us the tip.

124
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,690
Right.

125
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,950
'Cause as far as you're concerned,
the hell-bitch is practically family.

126
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,410
Yeah,boy,something major must've happened
while i downstairs, 'cause i come back, and --

127
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,220
And you're bff with a demon?

128
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,910
I told you,dean, she
helped me go after lilith.

129
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,310
Well,thanks for the
thumbnail -- real vivid.

130
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,240
You want to fill in a little detail?

131
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,600
Sure,dean, let's trade stories.

132
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,970
You first. How was hell?
Don't spare the details.

133
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,260
Six Months Earlier

134
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,750
Come on!

135
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
Where the hell are you?

136
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,420
I was wondering whether to come or not.

137
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,370
I mean,you shot one of my co-workers.

138
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,710
Don't take this the wrong way,sam,
but you don't look so hot,buddy.

139
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,280
I guess burying your brother
didn't agree with you.

140
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,370
Well...

141
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,370
Well,let's see that special
little knife of yours first.

142
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,730
No devil's traps,either.

143
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,020
I'm not here to play games.

144
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,850
Well,let me guess.

145
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,360
You want to make a deal.

146
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,010
And 'round and 'round
the winchesters go.

147
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,760
I'm sorry,sam. That's not gonna happen.

148
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,290
I don't want 10 years. I don't
want one year. I don't want candy!

149
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,970
I want to trade places with dean.

150
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,410
No.

151
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,840
Just take me! It's a fair trade!

152
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,230
No!

153
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,210
Why not? Lillith wants me dead. Just
let dean go, and she can have me.

154
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,300
Don't you understand,sam?

155
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,500
It's not about your soul.

156
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,260
Dean's in hell, right where we want him.

157
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,440
We've got everything
exactly the way we want it.

158
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,780
You want to kill me? Go ahead.

159
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,200
I've made peace with my lord.

160
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,460
Now,the orderly has no
recollection of anna's escape?

161
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,600
Apparently, she knocked him unconscious.

162
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
The blow caused some amnesia.

163
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,040
He doesn't even remember
coming into her room.

164
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,990
That's a hell of a right hook to knock
out a guy that's got 80 pounds on her.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,820
We think she may have planned
this, waited behind the door.

166
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,490
Right. Uh,you mentioned
anna's illness was recent.

167
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,790
Two months ago, she was happy, well-adjusted,
journalism major, lots of friends --

168
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,700
Bright future.

169
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,360
So,what happened --
she just... Flipped?

170
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,670
Well,that's the tragedy
of schizophrenia.

171
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Within weeks, anna was
overtaken by delusions.

172
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,940
What kind of delusions?

173
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,400
She thought demons were everywhere.

174
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,620
Interesting.

175
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,300
It's not uncommon for our patients
to believe that monsters are real.

176
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,270
Well,that --
that's just batty.

177
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,530
That's revelations.

178
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,310
Since when does the book of
revelations have jack-o'-lanterns?

179
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,320
It's a,uh,it's a
little-known translation.

180
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,780
Well,anna's father was a church deacon.

181
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,510
When she became ill, her paranoia
took on religious overtones.

182
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,560
She was convinced the devil was
about to rise up and end the world.

183
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,080
I hope you find her.

184
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,810
It's dangerous for her to
be out there alone right now.

185
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,980
Maybe they're not home.

186
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,660
Both cars in the driveway.

187
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,730
Mr. And mrs. Milton?

188
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,010
We're from the sheriff's department.

189
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,370
We just wanted to ask
you a couple of questions.

190
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,140
Sulfur.

191
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,540
The demons beat us here.

192
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,980
Whatever the deal is
with this anna girl --

193
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,870
yeah,they want her.They're
not screwing around.

194
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,230
All right, so,i'm "girl,interrupted,"
and i know the score of the apocalypse,

195
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,940
Just busted out of the nut-box...

196
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,050
Possibly using superpowers, by the way.

197
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,780
Where do i go?

198
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,470
Hey,you got those sketches
from anna's notebook?

199
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,810
- Yeah.
- Let me see 'em.

200
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,470
Check this out.

201
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,680
She was drawing the
window of her church.

202
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,210
Over and over.

203
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,570
If you were religious,scared, and had demons
on your ass, where would you go to feel safe?

204
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,220
Dean.

205
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,490
Anna?

206
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,740
We're not gonna hurt you.

207
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,590
We're here to help.

208
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,580
My name is sam. This is my brother,dean.

209
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,630
sam?

210
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,670
Not sam winchester?

211
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,330
Uh,yeah.

212
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,900
And you're dean. Thedean?

213
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,010
Well,yeah. Thedean,i guess.

214
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,300
It's really you.

215
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,250
Oh,my god.

216
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,780
The angels talk about you.

217
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,470
You were in hell, but castiel pulled you out,
and some of them think you can help save us.

218
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,700
And some of them don't like you at all.

219
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,170
They talk about you all the time lately.

220
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,070
I feel like i know you.

221
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,270
So,you talk to angels?

222
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,810
Oh,no. No,no way. Um,they
probably don't even know i exist.

223
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,830
I just kind of... Overhear them.

224
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,940
Youoverhearthem?

225
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,120
Yeah,they talk, and sometimes i just...

226
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,320
Hear them in my head.

227
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,410
Like... Right now?

228
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,530
Not right this second, but a lot.

229
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,010
And i can't shut them out,
there are so many of them.

230
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,530
So,they lock you up with a case of the
crazies when really you were just...

231
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,280
Tuning in to angel radio?

232
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,930
Yes. Thank you.

233
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,420
Anna,when did the voices
start? Do you rember?

234
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,700
I can tell you exactly
-- september 18th.

235
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,910
The day i got out of hell.

236
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,870
First words i heard, clear as a
bell -- "dean winchester is saved."

237
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,660
what do you think?

238
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,690
It's above my pay grade,man.

239
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,710
Well,at least now we know why
the demons want you so bad.

240
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,700
They get ahold of you, they can hear
everything the other side's cooking.

241
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,720
You're
1-900-angel.

242
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,180
Hey,um,do you know --
are my parents okay?

243
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,570
I -- i didn't go
home. I was afraid.

244
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,140
- You got the girl. Good,let's go.
- Her face!

245
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,130
- It's okay. She's here to help.
- Yeah,don't be so sure.

246
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,010
- We have to hurry.
- Why?

247
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,750
Because a demon's coming --
big-timer. We can fight later,dean.

248
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,150
Well,that's pretty convenient -- showing up right
when we find the girl with some bigwig on your tail?

249
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,900
- I didn't bring him here. Youdid.
- What?

250
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,080
He followed you from the
girl's house. We got to gonow.

251
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,450
Dean.

252
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,890
It's too late. He's here.

253
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,720
********

254
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,730
Okay. Stay in there. Don't move.

255
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,070
No,sam,you got to pull him right away.

256
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,970
Whoa,hold on a sec.

257
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,380
Now'snotthe time to bellyache
about sam going dark side.

258
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,950
He does his thing,he
exorcises that demon,or we die.

259
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,490
That tickles.

260
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,610
You don't have the
juice to take me on,sam.

261
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,890
Hello again,dean.

262
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,330
Come on,dean. Don't you recognize me?

263
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,080
Oh,i forgot -- i'm
wearing a pediatrician.

264
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,760
But we were so close... In hell.

265
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,700
Alastair.

266
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,130
You're gonna have to try a
whole lot harder than that,son.

267
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,040
Are you almost done?

268
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,340
I'm going as fast as i can.

269
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,580
Good,'cause you know i got a
dislocated shoulder over here.

270
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,950
Yeah.

271
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,770
I'll pop it back when i'm finished.

272
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,420
Give me that.

273
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,010
So,you lost the magic knife,huh?

274
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,150
Yeah,saving your ass.

275
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,060
Who the hell wasthat demon?

276
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,540
No one good.

277
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,430
We got to find anna.

278
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,500
Ruby's got her. I'm sure she's okay.

279
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,670
All right. Come on.

280
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,990
On three. 1...

281
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,110
You sure about ruby?

282
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,550
'Cause i think it's just as likely
she used us to find radio girl

283
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,100
and then brought that
demon in to kill us.

284
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,160
No,she took anna to keep her safe.

285
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,380
Yeah. Well,why hasn't she
called toell us where she is?

286
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,500
Because that demon is probably watching us right
now, waiting to follow us right back to anna again.

287
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,730
That's why he let us go.

288
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,980
You call this letting us go?

289
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,610
Yeah,i do.

290
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,640
Look,killing us would've
been no problem to that thing.

291
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,980
That's why,for now, we just got to lay
low and wait for ruby to contact us.

292
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,100
How's she gonna do that?

293
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,190
Why do you trust her so much?

294
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,540
I told you.

295
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,400
You got to do better than that.

296
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,440
Hey,and i'm not trying to pick a fight
here. I mean,i really want to understand.

297
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,730
But i need to know more. I
mean, i deserve to know more.

298
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,840
Because... She saved my life.

299
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,670
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

300
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,190
Thanks for keeping this warm for me,sam.

301
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,700
Ruby.

302
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,370
It's nice to be back.

303
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,190
Where i was,even for hell, it was nasty.

304
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,180
I guess i really pissed lilith off.

305
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,530
Imagine my relief when she gave me
one last chance to take it topside.

306
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,570
And all i had to do was
find you and kill you.

307
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,980
Fine. Go ahead! Do it.

308
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,850
Grab your keys. We got to go. Now!

309
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,680
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

310
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,940
you know what sounds good?

311
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,490
French fries.

312
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,110
I'm starving.

313
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,070
I just escaped hell. I deserve a treat.

314
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,200
You know, a "thank you" would be nice.

315
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,380
Who asked for your help?

316
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,710
You have no idea what i've been through.

317
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,740
When lilith gets pissed,
she gets creative.

318
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,040
You want to hear about the
corners of hell i've seen,sam?

319
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,550
No,i don't.

320
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,740
And the things i had to do
to convince her i was sorry?

321
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,940
That i could be trusted?

322
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,900
Well,this'll definitely get
you a fat christmas bonus.

323
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,980
Very funny.

324
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,740
I'm a fugitive... Foryou,sam.

325
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,960
I took all of this risk to get back to
you, so,yeah,i deserve a damn "thank you."

326
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,630
who asked you to save me?

327
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,890
I'm just trying to help.

328
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,350
Can you help me save dean?

329
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,700
No.

330
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,580
Nothing i know of is
powerful enough to do that.

331
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,570
Then i have no use for you.

332
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,200
- What?
- Get out.

333
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,110
Sam.

334
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,410
Whose body are you riding,ruby?

335
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,480
What do you care? You've
never asked me that before.

336
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,660
I'm asking now.

337
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,010
Some secretary.

338
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,110
- Let her go.
- Sam...

339
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,900
Or i send you right back to hell.

340
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,410
All right,pull it.

341
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,090
Who do i have to kill to get
some french fries around here?

342
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,680
Proof.

343
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,900
This body is 100% socially conscious.

344
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,610
I recycle.

345
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,470
Al gore would be proud.

346
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,390
You grabbed a coma patient?

347
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,910
You didn't want me to take
a body with someone in it,

348
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,990
and i made sure that
the spirit was gone.

349
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,250
Apartment was empty. You happy?

350
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,700
Why are you here?

351
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,070
I can't bring dean back.

352
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,570
But i can get you something
else that you want.

353
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,890
And,uh... What's that?

354
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,810
Lillith.

355
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,710
You want me to use my psychic whatever.

356
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,090
Look,i know that
it spooks you --

357
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,750
skip the speech.I'm ready.

358
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,680
Let's go.

359
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,480
Slow down there,cowboy.

360
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:53,060
Just tell me what i have to do.

361
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,580
Look,lillith is one scary bitch.

362
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,410
When i was in the pit, there was talk.

363
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,480
She's cooking up something
big -- apocalyptic big.

364
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,380
So let's kill her.

365
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,480
You want to go in there
and half-ass it like before?

366
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,690
We have the time to get it
right. Let's get it right.

367
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,720
Okay.

368
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,040
What do you want from me?

369
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,760
Well,a little patience...

370
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,800
And sobriety.

371
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,680
Promise me that...

372
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,260
And i will teach you everything i know.

373
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,930
So? What'd she teach you?

374
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,200
Well,the first thing i learned...

375
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,680
I'm a crappy student.

376
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,700
Not funny.

377
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,000
Just give it time,sam. It'll get better.

378
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,340
What? I need more practice?

379
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,180
I'm not talking about pulling demons.

380
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,530
I know losing
dean was --

381
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,390
i don't want to talk about it.

382
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,180
You know what?

383
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,300
Where do you get off slapping me with
that greeting-card, time-heals crap?

384
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,630
What the hell doyouknow?

385
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,320
I used to be human.

386
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,870
And i still remember what it
feels like to lose someone.

387
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,240
I'm sorry.

388
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,890
Don't.

389
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,400
I can't.

390
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,290
Sam,you're not alone.

391
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,730
What are you doing?

392
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,960
Sam,it's okay!

393
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,310
No,that isanything but okay!

394
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,870
What's wrong?

395
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,940
What'swrong?

396
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,350
Where do i start?

397
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,980
Is it because of the body?

398
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,590
Because i told you --
it's all me inside of here.

399
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,070
There is no one else.

400
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,270
And it's nice inside this body,sam.

401
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,270
Soft and warm.

402
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,680
What are you doing?

403
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,260
Isn't it 'cause you're really
scared to go there with a demon?

404
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:03,410
Because it's wrong and
it's bad and we shouldn't?

405
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,200
Sam?

406
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,210
Yeah?

407
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,260
Too much information.

408
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,770
Hey,i told you i was coming clean.

409
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,960
Yeah,but now i feel dirty.

410
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,710
Okay,well,uh, brain-stabbing
imagery aside...

411
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,530
So far,all you've told me about is a
manipulative bitch who,uh,screwed you,

412
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,520
Played mind games with you, and did
everything in the book to get you to go bad.

413
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,790
Yeah,well, there's more to the story.

414
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,770
Just... Skip the nudity,please.

415
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,070
Pretty soon after... That, um...

416
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,840
I put together some signs... Omens.

417
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,650
Saying what?

418
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,410
Lith was in town.

419
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,610
And i wanted to strike her first.

420
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,500
FIVE MONTHS EARLIER

421
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,940
You're not ready yet.

422
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,990
It's now or never.

423
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,510
No,we got towait until you get it right.

424
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,240
You haven't been too successful.

425
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,180
All right,i'll usethis.

426
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,250
Stop.

427
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,570
You can't just fly in there reckless,sam.
We need you to take the bitch out.

428
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,020
Oh,i'll take her out all right.

429
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,100
You get one shot, andyou'reit.

430
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,880
You're the only one who can do it,sam.

431
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,130
So if she kills you first...

432
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,750
What?

433
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,550
- You don't want to survive this.
- Come on.

434
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,970
It's a kamikaze attack.

435
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,130
You want to die fighting lilith.

436
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,870
That's stupid.

437
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,820
No,it's the truth, because if
you kill her and you survive this,

438
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,810
Then you have to go on
without your brother!

439
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,120
This isn't what dean would've wanted.

440
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,450
This isn't what he died for.

441
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,580
Get out of my way.

442
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,350
No,sam.

443
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,860
This is suicide!

444
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,320
FIVE MONTHS EARLIER

445
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,450
Please,i want to go home.

446
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,450
Lillith sends her regrets.

447
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,780
She couldn't make it.

448
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,720
Take the girl and run!

449
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,690
Ruby,you're in so much trouble.

450
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,240
When we get you
down in the basement.

451
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,420
The things we're gonna do to you.

452
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,440
Sam.

453
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,120
I'm okay.

454
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,720
Thanks.

455
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,110
Ruby came back for me.

456
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,620
Whatever you have to say, she saved me.

457
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,220
More than that, she got through to me.

458
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,510
What she said to me...

459
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,790
It's whatyou would've said.

460
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,990
If it wasn't for her,
i wouldn't be here.

461
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,920
Housekeeping.

462
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,440
Not now!

463
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,070
Sir,i've got clean towels.

464
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,310
Couldn't you just leave 'em at the door?

465
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,310
I'm at this address.

466
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,890
I'm sorry. What?

467
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,680
Go now.

468
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:52,250
Go through the bathroom window, don't
stop,don't take your car, don't pass go.

469
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,620
There are demons in the
hallway and in the parking lot.

470
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,660
Ruby?

471
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,960
Okay,yes,so i'm possessing this
maid for a hot minute. Sue me.

472
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,450
- What about
-- - coma girl?

473
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,000
Slowly rotting on the floor back at the
cabin with anna, so i've got to hurry back.

474
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,330
See you when you get there. Go!

475
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,810
- Glad you could make it.
-  yeah,thanks.

476
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,820
Anna,are you okay?

477
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,570
Yeah. I think so.

478
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,970
Ruby's not like other demons.

479
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,440
She saved my life.

480
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,250
Yeah,i hear she does that.

481
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,100
I guess i...

482
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,510
- You know.
- What?

483
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,840
I guess i owe you for... Sam.

484
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:55,770
And just i want to you know?

485
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,500
Don't strain yourself.

486
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,100
Okay,then. Is the moment over?

487
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,320
Good,'cause that was awkward.

488
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,040
Hey,sam,you think it'd be
safe to make a quick call,

489
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,900
Just to tell my parents i'm okay?

490
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,330
They must be completely freaked.

491
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,000
What?

492
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,430
Anna,um...

493
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,220
Your parents...

494
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,880
What about them?

495
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,200
Look,i'm sorry.

496
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,200
No,they're not...

497
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,800
Anna,i'm sorry.

498
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,700
why is this happening to me

499
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,230
I don't know.

500
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,940
they're coming.

501
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,660
back room

502
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,580
where's the knife?

503
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,050
uh...about that

504
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,350
you're kidding.

505
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,520
Hey, don't look at me

506
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,140
thanks a lot.

507
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,870
Great. Just peachy.
Impeccable timing, guys, really

508
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,680
Please tell me you're here to help.

509
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,570
We've been having demon issues all day.

510
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,490
Well, I can see that.

511
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,000
You want to explain why
you have that stain in the room

512
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,380
We're here for anna

513
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,720
here for her like... here for her?

514
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,120
stop talking.

515
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,890
Give her to us

516
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,290
are you gonna help her?

517
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,680
no she has to die.
