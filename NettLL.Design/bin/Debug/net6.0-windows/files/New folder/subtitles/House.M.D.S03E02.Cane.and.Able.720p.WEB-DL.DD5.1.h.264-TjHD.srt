he got that case wrong.

We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...

66
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,260
He gets depressed,
he stops exercising.

67
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,380
He stops exercising,
the muscle atrophies.

68
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,220
The muscle atrophies,
the pain returns.

69
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,460
Maybe he stopped exercising
because the giant hole
in his leg actually hurts.

The ketamine
could work perfectly,

and he would still be

Without Vicodin,
he's only got one to focus on.

103
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,430

He's having nightmares.

106

by a GI problem

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,670
Check his coags
with a PT,
PTT and bleeding time,

110
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,080
and prep him for endoscopies
from above and below.

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,190
I'm gonna make
a tiny nick in your forearm,
okay?

112
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,320
Then I'm gonna time how long
it takes for you
to stop bleeding.

113
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,530
Now, this is gonna sting
a little, so you might
wanna look the other way.

No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?

119
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,220
They put a chip in my neck
so they can keep track of me.

120
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,920

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,560

there is nothing back there.

122
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,760
There is.

123
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,800
Let me see. Lean forwards.

124
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,000
And they have this
other thing, and they put it
in between these two ribs,

125
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,510
always on this side,
and then they move it
around my insides.

126
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,700

00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,840

128
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,140

found the chip back there,

129
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,510

137
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,250
His alien-abduction story,
the level of detail is...

138
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,980
Well, I don't know
where he gets it from.

139
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,520
The parents say he doesn't
watch sci-fi. He doesn't read
comic books...

140
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,150
Great. You do any
of that medical stuff
we talked about?

141
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,120
Upper and lower endoscopies
were clean.

142
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,920
So it's a simple
bleeding disorder.

143
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,960
No, blood tests are
all normal, and he
clotted in six minutes.

144
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,730
So it's a simple
bleeding disorder, and you
screwed up the test.

145
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,790
I didn't screw up the test.

146
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,330
So it's a UFO.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.

147
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,430
Either you screwed up
the test, or I screwed up
my analysis of this case.

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,240
If you screwed up,
I don't have to
cry myself to sleep.

How could I screw up
a simple bleeding-time test?

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,980
Maybe you were abducted,
lost time.

Sure?

154
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,090
I had to stop the bleeding
myself after 25 minutes.

155
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,470
So you're saying
Chase did screw up.

156
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,970
Or Foreman screwed up.

157
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,450
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.

158
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,010
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playing the dozens.

159
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,210
You're at a huge cultural
disadvantage here, Chase.

160
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,150
Take a couple of minutes
to think of a witty retort.

161
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,020
So we have contradicting
bleeding-time tests.

162
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,360
If we run labs to check
his clotting factors, we can
confirm which one's right.

163
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,920
Yeah, testing. Nice idea.

164
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,590
Way better than trying
to guess which doctor's
incompetent.

165
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,460
Looks better
in the paperwork, too.

166

when her beeper goes off,

167
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,040

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,780
Where's Clancy?

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Oh, no! You take
Alpha Centauri, Foreman
can look on Tatooine,

172
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,540
and Cameron can set up
an intergalactic checkpoint.

173
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,970
Let's pray he hasn't gone
into hyperdrive.
We'll never catch him.

174
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,500
(GRUNTING)

175
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,180
Clancy?

176
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,350
I had to go where there are
no windows so I could get
the chip out like you said.

177
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,580
God.

178
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,020
I can feel it.
I just can't grab it.

179
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,220
Clancy, stop.
There is no chip.

180
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,470
We're gonna clean you up,
and we're gonna go back
to your room.

181
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,970
You can't do things like this.
Your parents...

182
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,950
(SIGHS)

183
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,660
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify
the metal.

184
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,530
Said it might not
even be terrestrial.

185
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,730
Really?

186
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,330
No, you idiot, it's titanium,
like from a surgical pin,

187
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,640
like the kind the kid
had inserted into his
broken arm four years ago.

188
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,800
Nice medical history.

189
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,430
That pin was removed
six months...

190
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,240
So a little piece broke off
during removal.

191
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,770
Titanium is used to
build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.

192
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,680
Tell that to the guys
on the <i>Kursk.</i>

193
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,020
And how exactly
did it get from his arm
to the back of his neck?

194
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,890
Body attacks
any foreign object.

195
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,790
Inflammatory reaction
could erode it into a vein.
Fragment gets a free ride.

196
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,420
To his lungs maybe,
not his neck.

197
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,430
Yeah, an alien chip
makes more sense.

198
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,500
The real mystery is
that you didn't actually
screw up.

199
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,730
You okay?

200
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,740
Fine. Tripped.

201
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,980
Kid carved a hole
in the back of his neck.

202
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,780
Apparently didn't bleed
to death. Now that's weird.

203
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,540
He clotted on his own?

204
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,950
Sure did.

205
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,920
So first there was no
bleeding disorder. Then there
was. Now there's not again.

206
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,290
Which is impossible.

207
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,620
Or Foreman screwed up.

208
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,960
Two out of three tests
agree with my findings.

209
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,120
Lucky for us,
the fourth test
will be the charm.

210
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,530
So you're just gonna
keep cutting him? Until what?

211
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,270
This test is different.

212
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,040
We'll draw some blood, and see
if any clotting factors
are low or missing.

213
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,770
But why haven't
the other tests...
We've got three results.

214
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,080
They haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.

215
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,710
Or two of them.

216
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,320
Is it possible
the problem isn't his blood?
It's just psychological?

217
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,330
I mean,
he almost killed himself.

218
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,590
He wasn't trying
to hurt himself.

219
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,960
No, he was just looking
for an alien tracking device.

220
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,500
I have time for one more.

221
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,370
Can't blame you
for spending extra time
down here.

222
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,040
I heard the Artist
Formerly Known as Gimp
is back upstairs.

223
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,600
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.

224
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,670
She's busy. I'll take it.

225
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,710
Oh, my God! You're...

226
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,320
You're okay!

227
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,690
Have we met?

228
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,560
I was one of your doctors.

229
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,990
You were in a vegetative state
when you left here last week.

230
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,030
Addison's disease.

231
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,230
All I needed was cortisol,
and my brain turned on
like a switch.

232
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,740
This is amazing!

233
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,100
Surprised you didn't know.

234
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,370
How would I know?

235
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,710
Not quite my old self yet.

236
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,870
Baby steps,
the doctors tell me. Now...

237
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,310
With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?

238
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,550
How would I...
I wanna have sex with my wife,

239
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,250
and I was hoping that
maybe you could...

240
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,950
Viagra?
You're here for Viagra?

241
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,520
A bucketful would be nice.

242
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,730
Dr. Cuddy.

243
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,830
Hi.

244
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,840
It's completely unethical.

245
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,170
He was reckless
with a patient.

246
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,210
He was right.
But he didn't know that.

247
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,210
He needs at least
some glimmer of humility.

248
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,480
Why does he need that?

249
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,490
Because other people
have that? Why does he need
to be like other people?

250
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,180
He needs to be less reckless.

251
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,720
Well, you did it.

252
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,020
He's dismissing symptoms,
looking for easy solutions.
He's in pain.

253
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,160
How much pain?
Why?

254
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,470
You know this is
affecting him, don't you?

255
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,340
Telling him that he got
his last case right won't do
anything to help him.

256
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,640
It'll make him less depressed.
Which might not help his leg.

257
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,680
But you don't know.

258
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,170
Just let me run a PET scan

259
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,380
on his parietal thalamic area
to see if it's sensing pain.

260
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,410
If it is, the ketamine isn't
working anymore, and he's
headed for a huge crash.

261
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,430
If it's not,
the leg pain is my fault,
and I will tell him the truth.

262
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,500
Too tight?

263
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,000
My parents think I'm crazy.

264
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,560
No, they don't.

265
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,130
They're just worried
about you. That's all.

266
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm not weird.

267
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,110
It's just that weird things
keep happening to me.

268
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,650
Slight pinch.

269
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,050
If you make me better,
do you think the aliens
will leave me alone?

270
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,850
I don't think they're gonna be
bothering you for much longer.

271
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,050
Are you lying again?

272
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,220
No.

273
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,920
We figure this out,
everything's gonna be okay.

274
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,040
(PANTING)

275
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,270
Still with us?

276
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,740
(GASPING)

277
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,210
NURSE: Let's go.

278
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,840
CHASE: Pulmonary edema,
stage-two hypertensive crisis.

279
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,680
What is happening?
Wait outside.

280
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,810
Get him oxygen, and start him
on an IV drip
of sodium nitroprusside.

281
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,250
Get them outside!

282
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,120
He's in ICU, systolic is
hovering around 170.

283
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,760
I left instructions to
lower it slowly so we don't
risk hypoperfusing his organs.

284
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,000
Trade-off being that leaving
his blood pressure
that high risks stroke,

285
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,370
MI and blindness.

286
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,130
I'm open to suggestions.

287
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,300
Solve the case.
Kidneys could explain...
Kidneys are clean.

288
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,570
Tell me
he's a mutant-human hybrid.

289
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,110
It is a bleeding disorder.

290
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,910
Clancy tested positive
for Von Willebrand's.

291
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,410
I didn't screw up.

292
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,750
How could he clot on his own
two out of three times?

293
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,720
Maybe he cheated.
CHASE: Right.

294
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,090
Kids always cheat
on their bleeding-time tests.

295
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,660
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.

296
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,000
I have no idea what you
meant, but I could smell
what The Rock was cooking.

297
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,770
I meant, he's clotting
right now, and he's
in hypertensive crisis.

298
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,210
Maybe the two are related.

299
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,840
What if he was hypertensive
the other two times
that he clotted?

300
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,970
Hypertensive crisis
can activate clotting factors.

301
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,210
Even someone low
on Von Willebrand's
could theoretically clot.

302
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,650
And the first time
Clancy clotted,
he was all worked up

303
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,850
recounting his alien
abduction. He could've
easily been hypertensive.

304
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,190
I know I get worked up
when I cut microchip tracking
implants out of my neck.

305
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,630
Sounds like a cheat to me.

306
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,630
Yeah, we get it.

307
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,100
Okay, what's the differential
for a seven-year-old boy

308
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,760
suffering multiple
hypertensive crises?

309
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,470
We think the problem is
in your son's heart.

310
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,170
We need to do a procedure
called a transesophageal echo.

311
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,750
Okay, and that will
fix his heart?

312
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,180
That will tell us where
the problem is, hopefully.
Then we can fix him.

313
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,560
Listen, this isn't
really part of my job,

314
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,620
but he's worried that
you think he's crazy.

315
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,730
Well, isn't he?

316
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,830
There are still plenty
of other explanations
for what's going on.

317
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:21,180
It's important he knows
you believe in him,
even if you don't.

318
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,750
FOREMAN: It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.

319
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,420
Why don't I have
a high-def in my office?
I'm a department head.

There are
no structural defects.
Valves are intact.

321

Tissue characterization is
impossible when the pixels
are the size of Legos.

See, this is what
I'm talking about.

Foreman, you gotta
steal this thing for me.

324
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,870
Let me ring up
one of the homies.

325
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,000
The clearer the image, the
clearer it is that there are
no masses, no clots, no tears.

326
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,410
The problem's gotta be
somewhere else.

327
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,010
We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,930
You're wrong, House.

330
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,360
Think he'll make us
break into the IMAX
before he admits it?

331
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,060
There.
Where?

332
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,600
Right there.

Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.

something not move

We don't have a laser pointer.
Well, why not?

337
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,040
Who's gonna take us seriously
if we don't have
a laser pointer?

338
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,780
Right here.

339
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,810
A few thousand myocytes
not beating with the rest.

340
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,190
So you've found an arrhythmia?

341
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,730
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhtyhmia.

342
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,460
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.

343
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,370
Go get me those myocytes.
I wanna talk to them
in my office.

344
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,140
How's the kid doing?

345
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,270
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.

346
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,940
Most of it, anyway.

347
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,610
Why do they bother
putting age restrictions
on these things

348
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,590
when all you have to do
is click, "Yes, I am 18?"

349
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,020
Even a 17-year-old
can figure that out.

350
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,080
What's going on with the leg?

351
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,550
First, tell me
what's going on
with the boobs.

352
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,390
If you're feeling pain...
They're firmer.

353
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,520
It's called an underwire.

354
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,430
I wanna get a PET scan
of your brain.

355
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,760
I think it's hormones.

356
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,270
As long as there's
no increased activity
in the thalamus...

357
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,240
Looks to me like those
puppies are going into
the dairy business.

358
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:35,140
...then the pain can be good.
It could be
muscle regenerating.

359
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,180
After you workout,
you get sore. Pain doesn't
mean the ketamine failed.

360
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,550
Guess I should be saying,
<i>"Mazel tov."</i> Who gets to
pass out the cigars?

361
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,890
I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan
of your brain.

362
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,080
Boy or girl?
You got a name picked out?
I'm not pregnant.

363
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,960
My leg doesn't hurt.
You're in denial.

364
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,830
No, I'm not!

365
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,360

don't you think

And here's the DNA
from that piece of his heart
we just biopsied.

378
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,270
That is impossible.

00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,840
We already did
and once more after that.

Anybody watch any <i>X- Files</i>
that inspired an explanation?

385
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,160
There are ways DNA
can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,470

Is that question helping?

You're sitting.

393

394

Please, someone,
give me a plausible,
terrestrial explanation

395
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,100
for this kid's alien DNA.

396
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,430
We could search his home
for toxins,
fungals and radiation.

397
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,440
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with strep,

398
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,100
we don't conduct a search
to see which classmate
he got it from. We cure it.

399
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,770
We know he's got the stuff
inside him. Let's get
a scalpel and cut it out.

400
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,780
Where do we cut?
Chances are,
it's not just in his heart.

401
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,110
Well, we got lucky
with the heart.
Myocytes contract.

402
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,310
We could see that
these weren't working.

403
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,690
I don't know how the hell
we're gonna find it
anywhere else.

404
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,920
What if we take
the heart cells with the bad
DNA, and we tag them?

405
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,600
Can you phrase that
in the form of a metaphor?

406
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,640
It's the same way
we search for cancer.

407
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,970
The bad DNA creates
a unique protein on the
surface of the affected cells.

408
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,670
We create an antibody
that recognizes
only that protein,

409
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,580
we flush it throughout
his system,
and the similar cells light up

410
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,170
like light bulbs.

411
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,450
Okay, let's do that.

412
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,520
You have to tell him.

413
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,760
He said he wasn't in any pain.

414
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,060
He's lying.
Of course he's lying.

415
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,430
We need another plan.

416
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,940
Don't talk about it that way.

417
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,130
What way?

418
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,730
"Plan."

419
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,370
It sounds like we're
conspiring against him.
I'm gonna tell him.

420
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,280
No, you're not.
Then come up with
a cunning plan and fast.

421
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,980
She's not nearly
as delightful
as she thinks she is.

422
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,260
What's this machine do?

423
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,960
Makes a lot of noise,

424
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,260
and it's gonna help us
figure out
what's wrong with you.

425
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,790
You think House
has lost a step?

426
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,730
He's fine.

427
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,400
There. Clump of affected cells
in the bone marrow
of the femur.

428
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,200
Explains the
intermittent-bleeding
disorder.

429
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,870
'Cause I don't need to
subject myself to House's
torture if there's no upside.

430
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm telling you, he's fine.

431
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,980
We missed some
affected cells in his heart.

432
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,350
Explains the continuing
hypertensive issues.

433
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,190
You said the last case
really threw him,
and now suddenly...

434
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,380
I was wrong.

435
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,720
So you changed your mind. Why?

436
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,520
His brilliant ideas
on this case
have all been yours.

437
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,320
There's the reason for him
needing glasses.

438
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,130
Apparently, it's a symptom.
It means
the condition predates...

439
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,940
You don't change your mind
without a reason.
Now, what do you know?

440
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:05,210
House didn't blow
the last case.

441
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,420
Cuddy cured the guy
using House's idea.

442
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,690
Cuddy and Wilson
are trying to teach him
some humility.

443
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,590
Scan is complete.
Three hot spots,
but nothing in his brain.

444
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,230
House's original theory was
right. It is not neurological.

STEPHANIE: "Functional"?
What does that mean?

448
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,140
He'll be able to walk,
but not run?
He'll have a limp?

449
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,710
If everything goes well,
he'll walk. He'll run.

450
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,340
He'll probably be
even stronger than he is now.

451
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,820
<i>When we close him up,</i>
<i>we'll move over</i>
<i>to his other leg,</i>

452
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,490
<i>snake a catheter up through</i>

<i>and into his heart.</i>

<i>are removed,</i>

no more problems
with his blood pressure.

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,750
Yeah, it's clear.

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,760
You can throw away

462
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,920

464
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,350
Do you wanna go for a run?

465
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,380
What do you want?

466
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,780
I want you to run.

467
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,850
When did you become
an enabler?

468
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,920
I'm enabling you to exercise.

469
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,490
Vicodin blocks the pain,
you get through your rehab,

470
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,690
muscle strength increases,
and pain decreases.

471
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,930
I'd rather not become
dependent on pain pills
to get through my day.

472
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,610
You're just like
any other patient,

473
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,670
running away from knowledge
that won't make you happy.

474
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,720
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.

475
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,410
You're scared
the ketamine treatment's
wearing off,

476
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,780
that it was just
a torturous window
to the good life.

477
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,290
What part of "poop"
didn't you understand?

478
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,260
How can you be so sure
it isn't just a sore muscle?

479
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,460
It's my leg.
We've known each other
a long time.

480
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,500
You're not always right,
House.
You've proven that lately.

481
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,300
STEPHANIE:
What's happening to him?

482
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,740
He's seizing.
I need clonazepam.

483
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,440
I thought you got it all.
Yeah, yell at me.
That'll fix your kid.

484
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,550
Obviously, we missed some
foreign tissue. There's
something still in him.

485
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,750
The hallucinations and
seizures indicate problems
in the temporal lobe.

486
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,780
Sorry, House,
it is neurological.
Looks like you're wrong again.

487
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,420
We didn't miss anything.
Brain scan was
completely clean.

488
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,900
Our tag must not have
penetrated
the blood-brain barrier.

489
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,000
Don't use an IV this time.
Get it right into the brain.

490
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,650
No cells are lighting up.
His brain is clean.
It is not neurological.

491
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,020
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be
neurological.

492
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:21,030
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.

493
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,530
What if it is there,
but didn't show up
on the scan?

494
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,040
What if the tag
just doesn't work
in his brain?

495
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,740
Brain cells are
structurally different,
express a different protein.

496
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,870
So how do we find it?

497
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,740
Where are we going?

498
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,840
I am going to think.

499
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,120
Send the kid home.

500
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,250
What do you mean?

501
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,890
Make sure his blood pressure's
stabilized, and send him home.

502
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,900
What, like nothing
ever happened?

503
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,130
We cured his
bleeding disorder,

504
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,230
removed all the damaged cells
we could find.

505
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,900
We don't know that
we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.

506
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,530
Maybe these symptoms
come and go
like the blood disorder.

507
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,100
It's more probable that his
remaining symptoms are

508
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,880
just a nightmare.

509
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,350
He had a convulsion.

510
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,150
May be epilepsy.
May be psychological.
May be nothing.

511
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,220
If the kid gets sick again,
it'll give us another clue.

512
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,390
We can start searching again.
If he doesn't, doesn't matter.

513
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,190
Send him home.

514
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,460

516
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,540
You're just giving up
on this kid?

517
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,610
You gotta know when to stop.

518
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,340
You don't stop.
You never stop.

519
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,290
You just keep on going
until you come up with
something so insane

520
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,620
that it's usually right.

521
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,950
Except on my last case.

522
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:32,690
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.

523
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,460
This kid obviously
has something wrong with him.

524
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,300
When did you develop
such strong opinions
about my patients?

525
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,500
Last week,
you were convinced
my patient wasn't sick.

526
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,970
Now you're convinced
this one is.

527
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,770
This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.

528
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,110
Just get together
with your team,
spend a few extra hours...

529
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,590
Well, I guess we could
amputate his left leg. That's
where we found most of it.

530
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,990
Maybe we should just
remove his affected eye
completely.

531
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,750
If you have reason
to believe that
that might help...

532
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,660
I'm not gonna start
lopping off body parts,

533
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,260
but it's interesting
that you give me
the green light.

534
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,660
I just want you
to do something.

535
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,200
You've been overly supportive
this entire week.

536
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,100
Either you're hormonal,
or you're guilt-ridden,

537
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,510
and it's too early
in the pregnancy
for this to be hormonal.

538
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,710
I'm not pregnant.
Then what did you do wrong?

539
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:36,120
He had Addison's.
Your last patient.
You were right.

540
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,530
I gave him one shot of
cortisol and he woke up
like Rip van Winkle.

541
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,190
(SCOFF)

542
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,070
Oh, your mommy is in
such trouble.
She's such a liar.

543
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,510
That's why you don't have
a daddy.
That's why she had to...

544
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:08,120
How does one person
end up with two different
sets of DNA?

545
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,680
We've been through this.

546
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,690
Our assumptions are faulty.

547
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,730
We've confirmed two different
sets of DNA.
We re-ran the sequence.

548
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,460
I didn't say the lab work
was faulty. I said
our assumptions were faulty.

549
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,500
We assumed he's a person.

550
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,670
Of course. The aliens
didn't just visit him.
They replaced him.

551
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,200
You're being silly. What if
he's not a person?
What if he's two persons?

552
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,510
I'm not getting the metaphor.
No metaphor.

553
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,980
Chase, you said the mom
used in vitro fertilization,
right?

554
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,350
Yeah, they had trouble
conceiving.

555
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,010
Kid was right all along.

556
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,180
He was implanted with
something,
back when he was young.

557
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,690
I mean really young,
like 12-cells young.

558
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,490
In vitro increases
the likelihood of twinning.

559
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,760
But he doesn't have a twin.

560
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,770
Not walking around.

561
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,700
But in vitro fertilization
costs around 25 grand a pop,

562
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,140
so doctors implant two
to six embryos to make sure
you get your money's worth.

563
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,900
<i>Problem is, there's not</i>
<i>always enough bedrooms</i>
<i>for all the kiddies.</i>

564
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,170
<i>Two brothers get stuck</i>
<i>sharing. There's no bunk beds,</i>

565
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,480
<i>so they cuddle up</i>
<i>to keep warm,</i>
<i>and they never untangle.</i>

566
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,680
He's two people in one.

567
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,280
It's called chimerism.

568
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:18,450
Unfortunately, his brother's
like a bad doubles partner.

569
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,300
The guy just takes up space,
gets in the way.

570
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,700
Clancy's body thinks
that he's gonna put away
the easy winners.

571
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,860
His brother just keeps
swatting balls into the net.

572
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,130
We gotta get him
off the court.

573
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,740
So does that mean that
you can find the bad cells
in his brain or not?

574
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,370
Sure, abandon the metaphor.
Fine.

575
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,190
Clancy thinks differently
than his brother
because he thinks.

576
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,190
If we induce
an alien abduction...

577
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,820
Wait. What the hell
are you talking about?

578
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,830
The foreign DNA has got to
be in a portion of your
son's brain

579
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,090
that makes him believe
that he's being abducted.

580
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,630
If we stimulate those neurons
with an electric probe,

581
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,400
we can trick
your son's brain
into hallucinating.

582
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,170
Your son's neurons will
light up, and his brother's
cells will remain dark.

583
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,130
Those are the ones we cut out.

584
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,740
You're talking about
brain surgery.

585
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:13,550
I'm talking about
really cool brain surgery.
One of your sons will die,

586
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,810
but the taller one
won't be so annoying anymore.

587
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,750
So I have a twin?

588
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,310
Not really.
What's on the card?

589
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,550
A light bulb.

590
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,420
Start us out at 10.

591
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,460
I'm not doing that.

592
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,230
That was all me, kid. Sorry.

593
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:38,170
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.

594
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,010
He lives inside me?

595
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,200
Sort of.

596
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,040
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.

597
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,180
You're in sensory.
You're getting closer.

00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,380

599
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,180
Moon and stars.

600
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,250
So I am kind of weird?

601
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,160
We're all kind of weird.

602
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,830
No!

603
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,030
Clancy?
We got something.

604
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,040
What do you see?
The light.

605
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,840
Here they come, I think.

606
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,140
Brain waves indicate
a mild hallucination.
Neurons are lighting up.

607
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,300
Any dark spots?
Area's too fuzzy.

608
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,010
Hallucination isn't
strong enough.

609
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,740
Turn up the juice.

610
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,440
His blood pressure's already
160 over 110. Any higher...

611
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,790
Riding the short bus
is better than not breathing.
Take us to 100.

612
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,460
Area's still too fuzzy
to make any kind of
distinction.

613
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,500
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded

614
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,940
the preset maximum.
Next step's brain damage.

615
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,740
They're gonna get you.
They're coming
through the walls.

616
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,250
They're gonna take you,
torture you. You'll never
see your parents again.

Clancy?

620
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,550

00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,650

Everything's gonna be
normal again.

You believe what
Cuddy tried to pull?

626
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,550
What now?

627
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,380
She lied to me.

628
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,120
She cured my patient
with my diagnosis,
then lied to me about it.

629
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,790
That doesn't sound like her.

630
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,490
You're right.

631
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,960
Does sound like you, though.

00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,430
What exactly did
Cuddy tell you?

Nothing that your
body language
isn't telling me right now.

634
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,600
So what was the plan?

635
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,780
I'd feel so humbled by
missing a case that
I'd reevaluate my entire life,

636
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,350
question the nature of truth
and goodness
and become Cameron?

637
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,550
Something like that.
More that if we told you
the truth,

638
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,620
that you solved a case
based on absolutely
no medical proof,

639
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,690
you'd think you were God.

640
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,200
And I was worried
your wings would melt.
