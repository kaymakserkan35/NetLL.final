Blue Calamari is

00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,364
and holding second place,
while Blue Calamari
is at a steady speed.

5
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,443
And down the stretch
they come!

Here's your information

Hey, that's my birthday.

00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,531
February 4, 1963.
Do you think
that's a good bet?

14
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,365
What's your birthday?

15
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,564
Take your time.

16
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,869
Don't worry. There's only
30 seconds to post.

17
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,240
Is there any way I can bet
on the six and the three also?

18
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,246
You know, for the year?
AII four horses.
Can I do that?

19
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:53,052
He wants a $2 exacta box,
two, four, six, three.
Give him $24.

00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,857

$500 on the three horse,

Seminole Uprising to win.

23
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,365
Might as well burn your money.

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,260
I'II burn my winnings.
Bigger flame.

25
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,101
Same race, Termigator to win.

26
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,599
Sorry, race just closed.

27
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,905
Damn it.

28
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,408
She was 14-to-1, too.

29
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,177
Then fatass over there
just saved you money.

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,478
No way Seminole Uprising's...

31
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,645
I don't bet on the horses.
I bet on the jocks.

My rider's bulimic,
purges after his weigh-ins.

Leave a two-pound pile at the

00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,060

T rying to cop a feel?

42
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,516
I took a CPR class at the Y.

43
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,456
That would be useful if
she was having a heart attack
instead of a seizure.

44
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,220
Seizure? Hold her tongue down?

45
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,885
If you wanna get
a finger bitten off.

46
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,054
Call an ambulance.

48
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,689
I could drive her.
Just make the call.

What the hell is that?

50
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,140
How should I know?

51
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,172
Tell the paramedics
to take her to
Princeton-PIainsboro.

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,713

And it's Termigator,
winning by two lengths.

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,245
Since when does House
hang out at OTB?

55
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,448
The man's an addict.

56
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,218
Right, addicted to pills,
not gambling.

57
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,554
It's the same thing.

58
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,617
Drug abuse,
drinking, gambling.

59
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,524
They all fire up
the same pleasure centers
in the brain.

60
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,156
An addict is an addict
is an...

61
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,791
Gambling doesn't take away
his pain.

62
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,532
It does when I win.

63
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,505
Hot OTB babe has grand mal

64
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,967
and inexplicable bruising.

65
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,669
What up with that?

66
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,905
You were just standing there,
and she started to seize?

67
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,540
Spend as much time
around the real people
as I do,

68
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,640
someone gets sick.

69
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,083
Her platelets are 89,
she's anemic.

70
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,220
And she has
a blood alcohol Ievel of 0.13.

71
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,950
Hot OTB babe?

72
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,485
Obviously a working girl.
Probably an STD infection.

73
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,256
No fever. No infection.

74
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,093
AIcohol abuse explains it all.

75
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,923
Causes seizures and affects
her blood's ability to clot,

76
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,263
which causes bruising.

77
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,997
Start her on heparin,
she'II be fine by morning.

78
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,198
Except for the fact
that the bruises
are not petechial,

79
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,501
which means it's not DIC.

80
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,542
So the bruises were caused
by trauma.

81
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,408
She probably got beat up
by her boyfriend. Or her pimp.

82
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,812
What's that called
when you judge someone
before ever meeting them?

83
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,816
She's a regular at OTB.

84
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,849
Somehow, I don't see her
holding down a 9-to-5
and going to PTA meetings.

85
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,480
I was there.
I have a 9-to-3 job.

86
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,789
It could be SLE,
familial telangiectasias,
or even Cushing's.

87
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,123
Good. Start with those.

88
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,289
Which one?

89
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,799
Cushing's. It explains
the seizure and the bruising.

90
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:28,891
Not the anemia.

91
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,265
So she doesn't eat
a Iot of meat.

92
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,271
DIC brought on
by alcohol abuse
is far more Iikely.

93
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,673

And Iab her up, LP, MRI.

order me to get
her medical history?

00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,843
Cuddy put me in charge
Iast week, so, yeah.

97
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:57,325
It was a pretend in charge,
a formality to get past
the suits in Iegal.

00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,634
You can have it.
You'II also need
my handicap placard.

101
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,764
Bend over.

102
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,808
You make
a pretty convincing argument.

103
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,935
Chase killed that woman.
Now Foreman's in charge?

104
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,013
CUDDY: Yeah, we have
a pecking order here.

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,707
If Cameron kills somebody,
Chase takes over.

106
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,443
There's a flow chart
in the Iobby.

107
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,179
For the next three weeks,
you answer directly
to Dr. Foreman.

108
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,813
And I expect you here
for grand rounds at 9:00.

By the way,
I Iike sugar in my coffee.

If there's a screw up,
it's your screw up.

111
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,895
You won't have Dr. House
to fall back on.

112
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,834
"Do you wear a seat belt?"
Is that really relevant
to a seizure?

113
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:42,966
Skip it.

114
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,567
How about,
"Were you vaccinated
for polio?"

115
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,443
I think you gave me
the form intended for FDR.

116
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,414
You really Iike
Teeny Tiny Mo in the fifth?

117
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,474
I went 4-for-6 yesterday.

118
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,484
You want winners?
Cure me first.

119
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,948
"Are you generally satisfied
with your Iife?"

120
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,989
It does not ask that.

121
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,559
You know, I was gonna ask

122
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,000
what a respectable doctor
was doing at an OTB parlor.

123
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,239
Somehow that question
doesn't seem relevant anymore.

124
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,399
What's your excuse?

125
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,635
It turns me on.

126
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,439
Yeah? What else
turns you on? Drugs?

127
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,139
Casual sex? Rough sex?

128
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,676
Casual rough sex?

129
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,115
I'm a doctor. I need to know.

130
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,483
No sex.

131
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,056
Just moved here.
Haven't even found a job yet.

132
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,284
Don't know anybody.

133
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,019
Came here without a job.

134
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,159
That means you didn't
move here, you moved away
from somewhere else.

135
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,392
Does that hurt?
No.

136
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,300
Are you on any
prescription meds?
Hormones? Prednisone?

137
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,604
I already answered that one.
I think it was
question number 20-something.

138
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,405
Well, yeah. And I could
reach down and get it.

139
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,378
But that would kind of spoil
the whole cool move.

140
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,347
I'm not on any medications.

141
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,474
Are you a vegetarian?

142
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,108
No. Why?

143
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,144
Because you might have
something called
Cushing's syndrome,

144
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,279
which basically means...

145
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,848
My pituitary
is overproducing ACTH,

146
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,795
which is causing my adrenal
glands to push too much
cortisol into my bloodstream.

147
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,298
What a coincidence.
I'm a doctor, too.

148
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,857
Yeah, I had it Iast year.

149
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,332
They did brain surgery,
removed an adenoma
from my pituitary.

No, Cameron had three ideas.

I chose one to encourage,
to nurture...

Yeah, you're all about
the nurturing.

Still don't see anything.

167
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,653
Okay, so it's a microadenoma.

168
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,818
Too small to see.

So small,
it's not even there.

00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,796
that she happened to have
a year ago.

172
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,266
Results from her LP
back yet?

173
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,929
Didn't do an LP.
I knew what she had.

174
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,063
Go do the LP.

175
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:39,150
Okay, I need you
to roll over on your side,
kiss your kneecaps.

176
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,051
Party time.

177
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,719
I thought it only took
one doctor to do this.

178
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,881
I'm observing.

179
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,357
She's here to make sure
I don't paralyze you.

180
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,521
You've done this before,
right?

181
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,721
Successfully?

182
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,627
He's kidding.
He's an excellent doctor.

183
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,825
I'm going to numb
the area with some Iidocaine,

184
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,028
and then we're off
to the races.

185
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,501
See what I did there?

186
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,098
I used horse-racing jargon
to make the patient
feel more comfortable.

187
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,636
Okay, here we go.

188
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,201
(GASPS)

189
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,406
Felt Iike bone.
Does that hurt?

190
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,210
A Iittle bit.
What are you doing?

191
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,375
(GROANING)

192
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,917
Try rounding your back
a bit more.

193
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,953
You're perfect
just the way you are.

194
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,613
Oops, that was all me.

195
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,322
Might want to move down
one vertebra.

196
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,793
This is actually much harder
than I remember.

197
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:23,988
(GROANING)

198
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,556
My chest feels
a Iittle tight.

199
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,156
Try taking a deep breath.

200
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,792
Dr. House,
maybe I should take it
from here.

201
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,200
Eighth time's the charm.

202
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,771
You trying
to piss off Foreman?

203
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,596
Just Iet...

204
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,365
CAMERON: BP's 240 over 140.

205
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,808
Turn that thing off,
will you?

206
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,209
Take the needle out.

207
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,906
Take the needle out!
Okay.

208
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,581
It's a hypertensive crisis.
Start her on an
IV Iopressor drip.

209
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,487
Titrate to systolic
Iess than 140.
She'II be fine.

210
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,959
Cameron. Meet me in my office.

211
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,930
At the risk
of sounding redundant
and right, again,

212
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,166
she has Cushing's. Cushing's.

213
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,726
Right, the fact that
you mangled her LP
has nothing to do with it.

214
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,830
Actually, it has
everything to do with it.

215
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,741
Cushing's plus stress
equals hypertensive crisis.

216
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,811
Smart move,
sending the rookie.

217
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,315
Her initial symptoms
could have been caused
by alcohol-induced DIC.

218
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,974
She had a hypertensive crisis

219
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,212
because it's been at Ieast
six hours since she had
her Iast drink.

220
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,345
She's detoxing.

221
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,322
The exact same moment
that I'm futilely trying
to give her an LP?

222
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,293
Right. An invisible tumor
on her pituitary
is much more Iikely.

223
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,227
CHASE: What if the tumor
is somewhere else?

224
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,698
There could be
an ACTH-secreting tumor
on her Iung or pancreas.

225
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,756
It's awfully rare.

226
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,393
Not as rare
as an invisible tumor.

227
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,098
Why didn't they put you
in charge instead of Foreman?

228
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,970
Oh, yeah, you're the guy
that killed that woman.

229
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,500
Get a pan-man scan
before she dies a cortisol OD.

230
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,342
(WHIMPERS)

231
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,681
Fine. Do it.

232
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,716
But when you
don't find anything,
put her on a Librium taper

233
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,757
for the withdrawal
and get her a bed
in a rehab clinic.

234
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,894
CHASE: Lungs Iook clean.

235
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,096
Her Iymph nodes
are not enlarged.

236
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,233
Cuddy tapped Foreman
to run the department.

237
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,837
I didn't even get asked.

238
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,971
Neither did I.

239
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,037
You were suspended.

240
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,139
I was kidding.

241
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,219
It's the irony of women
in charge. They don't Iike
other women in charge.

242
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,746
What? You think
it's something else?

243
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,652
You sabotaged yourself.
You went on a date with House.

244
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,663
You slept with me.
Putting you in charge
of this department

245
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,495
is Iike a
sexual harassment suit
waiting to happen.

246
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, they're really worried

247
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,469
that I'm gonna create
a hostile work environment.

248
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,563
Maybe that's the problem.

249
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,204
Being in charge
means having
to say no to House.

250
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,637
Would you hire you for that?

251
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:00,279
ANNOUNCER: (ON TV)
Anderson coming out strong.
What is he thinking?

252
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,684
He watched
what Tom Mants just did.

253
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,753
You ordered MRIs
for the entire maternity ward?

254
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,224
I was in a crazy mood.

255
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,296
Good thing I got
a new boss to back me up.

256
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,456
AIthough, I think
one of those
is actually necessary.

257
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,126
Better comb through
before you cancel them all.

258
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,740
What do you expect me to do,
House? Quit? Cry?

259
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,810
Actually, I expect you
to act Iike what you are.

260
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,506
My employee. My subordinate.

261
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,111
My bitch.

262
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,982
Well,
since you asked nicely...

263
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,314
My God.

264
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,583
I can't believe I got
more than a year behind
on my discharge summaries.

265
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,955
Got to get caught up.
Oh, no, wait.

266
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,257
I'm not authorized to sign
these anymore. Only you are.

267
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,122
Keep it coming.
I'm not gonna break.

00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,657
(DOOR OPENS)

269
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,259
Scan showed a mass
on her pancreas.

270
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,365
Looks malignant.
Probably inoperable.

271
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,166
I'd give her two months.

272
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,750
On the bright side,
it still means I was right.

273
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,354
Where's Dr. House?

274
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,622
Dr. Foreman's
overseeing your case.

275
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,730
He thought it'd be best
if I spoke with you. We found
a mass in your pancreas.

276
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,232
It Iooks Iike cancer.

277
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,538
So something in my pancreas
caused me to have a seizure?

278
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,309
Probably.
But the bigger point is...

279
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,783
A one-year survival rate
for pancreatic cancer
is Iess than 20%.

280
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,514
So what's the treatment?

281
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:48,489
We need to
biopsy the mass to see
what we're dealing with,

282
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,927
and then we can

283
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,463
recommend options
from there.

284
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,098
Sounds good.

285
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,634
I need your consent
to do the biopsy.

286
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,606
Thanks.

287
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,412
Wish me Iuck.

288
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,750
Good Iuck.

289
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,020
CAMERON: It was weird.
She barely reacted at all.

290
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,554
I've had people hug me
and people take a swing at me.

291
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,927
This was more Iike
she didn't even hear me.

292
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,261
Magnify three times.

293
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,832

294
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,198
That is funny.

00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,943
Too bad Foreman's gonna die.

296
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:55,660
Good afternoon,
I'm Dr. House. I'm gonna
be Iooking at your...

297
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,659
Perfect.

298
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,623
Excuse me.

299
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,200
Need Dr. Foreman
in exam room one
for a consult.

300
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,109
So, when did this start?

301
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,843
Couple weeks ago.

302
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:19,751
I didn't want to get pregnant.
Jake's not into rubbers,
so I got on the jelly.

303
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,253
You think I'm allergic
or something?

304
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,747
You have an infection.

305
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,015
I'm gonna need a sample.

306
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,456
I brought the jar.

307
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,753
No, I meant
a sample of your...

308
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,628
Okay. We have
a neurological problem here.

309
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,332
There's something wrong
with my brain?

310
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,771
Oh, yeah.

311
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,810
Cover yourself up.
Got what I need.

312
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,940
What's up?

313
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,108
Smell this.

314
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,022
Smells Iike vaginosis,
but it's not really my call.

315
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,650
Great. I'II be sure to put
a gold star by your name
on the board.

316
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,652
Anica's biopsy
for pancreatic cancer
was negative.

317
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,072
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some antibiotics

318
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,936
and you probably
shouldn't have sex
for a while.

319
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,032
How Iong?

320
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,237
On an evolutionary basis,
I'd recommend forever.

321
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,574
The mass in the pancreas
is benign. It's probably
just scar tissue.

322
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,018
Good news. She's not
sick at all. Other than
being an alcoholic.

323
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,718
The Iabs you sent yesterday
put her ACTH at 64
picograms per milliliter.

324
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,124
She's got Cushing's.
Something set it off.

325
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,029
It's gotta be in her brain.
Set her up for a
venous sampling.

326
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,292
There is another possibility.

327
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,459
Chase, hold on.

328
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,130
How'd you get him trained
so fast? EIectronic collar?

329
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,399
Got treats in your pocket?

330
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,306
She didn't even read
the consent form
for the pancreatic biopsy.

331
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,434
Who reads those things?

332
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,775
Maybe she didn't read it
because she knew that there
was nothing wrong with her.

333
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,610
There is another explanation
for the Cushing's.

334
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,016
Maybe she injected herself
with the ACTH. Her behavior
suggests Munchausen's.

335
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,680
She's had
four hospitalizations
in the Iast four months.

336
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,817
Well, being hospitalized
a Iot certainly points to
nothing being wrong with you.

337
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,821
She's had zero symptoms
since she got here.

338
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,123
The scarring on her pancreas

339
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,062
could be caused from
injecting herself
with the benzene

340
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,395
and setting off the seizures.

341
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,025
HOUSE: She's had
brain surgery.

342
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,793
You can fake a stomachache.
You can't fake a brain tumor.

343
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,102
You can fake an invisible one.

344
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,775
We should check her apartment.
Look for medications,
syringes...

345
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,937
Venous sampling's easier.

346
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,105
And more dangerous.

347
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,671
Not if you get caught
breaking in.

348
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,149
So don't get caught, House.

349
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,122
Why do you think Cuddy
picked Foreman over me?

350
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,213
Have I done something wrong?

351
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,723
Or if there's something
I needed to improve on...

352
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,816
Will it make you shut up

353
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,258
if I told you she wanted
someone black?

354
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,124
How would you describe
my Ieadership skills?

355
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,596
Nonexistent.
Otherwise excellent.

356
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,429
There's more to being a Ieader
than being a jerk.

357
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,594
The world will never know.

358
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,970
(MOTOR REVVING)

359
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,405
No. No way. It just snowed.

360
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,104
Yesterday.
The streets are clear.

361
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,413
My car is right there.

362
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,179
There's construction on EIm.
Bike will be faster.

363
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,664
CAMERON: There's even books
in the bathroom.

364
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,140
Well, either she's very smart
or she has a severe
fiber deficiency.

365
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:44,251
She's got an appointment
with her ophthalmologist
on Tuesday

366
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,848
and an appointment
with her gynecologist
on Thursday.

367
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,927
Multiple appointments
with multiple doctors.

368
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,689
Symptom of Munchausen's.

369
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,228
Or, just thinking
outside the box here,

370
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,133
she has a vagina
and trouble reading.

371
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,334
There's three pairs
of reading glasses, each
with different prescriptions.

372
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,240
Which would be explained
by a tumor pressing
on the optic nerve.

373
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,039
Because you're Iooking
for her to have a tumor.

374
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,841
And you're Iooking for...

375
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,479
A person
with Munchausen's syndrome
drinks battery acid.

376
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,179
But they don't go
to an ophthalmologist
to get their pupils dilated.

377
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,519
An ophthalmologist
is a doctor.
Attention is attention.

378
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,253
How many hospitals
have you contacted? Has one
doctor said she's crazy?

379
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,487
It's not Munchausen's.

380
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,120
It's not your call.

381
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,493
If you think
she's got Munchausen's,

382
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,229
then obviously you got
something to show the man.

383
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,169
A syringe in her apartment.
A bottle of ACTH.

384
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,400
Munchausen's patients are good
at covering their tracks.

385
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,103
Right. So, the fact
that we found nothing
proves there's something.

386
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,011
Look at the pathology reports
from the surgery
she had in Chicago.

387
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,742
They removed 30%
of her pituitary.
They found no tumor.

388
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,750
It's possible
the surgeons just missed it.

389
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,945
In that kind of surgery,
you're just cutting
and hoping...

390
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,818
Of course, we're both right.

391
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,483
Excellent solution,
everybody's happy.

392
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,117
Come on, step up, Foreman.

393
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,027
If you think I'm right,
order me to stick
a needle in her brain.

394
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,257
If you think Cameron's right,
send the patient home.

395
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,926
Either she'II be fine,
or she'II die.

396
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,266
Do the venous sampling.
Get her consent.

398
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,877
Nice move, boss.
Way to cover your ass.

399
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,043
I just agreed with you.

400
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,639
Not because
you think I'm right,

401
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,914
you're just taking
the safe route. You're a wuss.

402
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,418
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

403
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,957
Hey, Wilson,
guess what Foreman just did!

404
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,156
(SIGHS)

405
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,593
Hi.

406
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,605
This is a consent form
to stick a wire
into your brain.

407
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,076
It's important for hospitals
to get these signed
for procedures

408
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,477
that are
completely unnecessary.

409
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,947
Then why are you doing it?

410
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,416
Because you're mentally ill.

411
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,822
You injected yourself
with ACTH to induce Cushing's
to get attention from doctors.

412
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,221
And so far, it's worked.

413
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,559
I'd Iike to see
another doctor.

414
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,923
I'm not giving you
what you want?

415
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,521
I don't want a bitch.

416
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,066
Just sign the forms, okay?
And I'II get out of here.

417
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,196
Hopefully for you,
whatever you injected
yourself with won't wear off

418
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,264
before you get the fun
of a caring and concerned
doctor cutting into your head.

419
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,888
You chose me
to make House miserable,
didn't you?

420
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,861
Apparently,
he's making you miserable.
That's impressive.

421
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,355
Find someone else.

422
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,455
No.

423
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,557
For the first time
in six years,

424
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,660
I'm getting copied
on all experimental tests
and procedures.

425
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,831
CIinic hours have been
Iogged and completed.

426
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,307
You've given me four months
of House's dictations

427
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,435
so I can finally bill
insurance companies.

428
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,640
I only did that stuff to prove
he couldn't make me miserable.

429
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,443
Well, way to go.

430
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,145
Now everybody's getting
what they need, even House.

431
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:05,553
He gets to play mad scientist,
and this department
runs smoothly.

432
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,491
So I'm stuck with this
for the next three weeks.

433
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,686
Maybe Ionger.

434
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,496
Would you be interested
if this wasn't just pretend?

435
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,631
What did Mommy say?
I don't get any candy
in my stocking?

436
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,366
Patient being prepped
for the venous sampling?

437
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,841
Yeah, a mentally ill patient
is right on track
for a pointless procedure.

438
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,071
Yeah, we get your objection.

439
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,203
(PHONE RINGING)

440
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,112
Foreman. Are you sure?

441
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,081
That doesn't make any sense.
Check it again.

442
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,749
We gotta delay
the venous sampling.

443
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,819
Why? Her urine turning orange?

444
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,328
How would you know that?

445
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,130
Because
that's what rifampin does.

446
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,795
She's not on antibiotics.

447
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,568
But if a Munchausen's patient
thinks she's about
to get busted,

448
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,269
she sees pills Iabeled
"Dangerous,
might cause seizures,"

449
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,709
she might grab a couple.

450
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,215
And if that Iabel
were accidentally
on a bottle of antibiotics,

451
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,546
and if that bottle
were accidentally
Ieft in her room...

452
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,607
You set her up?

453
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,677
Might have.
It's Munchausen's.

454
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,852
AII this, she did to herself.

455
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,737
I don't know
what the hell
you're talking about.

456
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,246
I had a seizure. I'm sick.
I need your help.

457
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,045
Not from this department.

458
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,018
The half-Iife
of rifampin is three hours.

459
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,988
After that,
you'II get your psych referral
and your discharge papers.

460
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,456
You know,
just because you stick
your fingers down your throat

461
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,256
doesn't mean
the rest of us are screwed up.

462
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,990
I guess
when cooperation fails,
you move on to hostility.

463
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,359
I didn't do this to myself.

464
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,445
100% commitment.
Sign of a good Iiar.

465
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,711
AIso the sign of a sociopath.

466
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,781
What are you doing?

Correcting your Iast note.

00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,481
We can't discharge her
if she's sick.

469
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,890
Anybody ever tell you,
you write Iike a girl?

470
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,019
What?

471
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,188
You got some other explanation
for orange urine?

472
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,253
It's Munchausen's.

473
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,629
Correct, but not complete.

474
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,827
You just don't want to admit
that she skunked you.

475
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,929
At the end of
The Boy Who Cried Wolf,
the wolf really does come.

476
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,974
Then he eats the sheep,
and the boy, and his parents.

477
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,135
The wolf doesn't eat
the parents.

478
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,235
He does when I tell it.

479
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,008
You're not telling
the story now. I am.

480
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,042
Look, I checked her records.

481
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,347
AII her hospitalizations
were for different things.

482
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,184
Brain tumor, fainting spells,
skin rashes, seizures.

483
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,746
She's had every
blood test known to man

484
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,121
and the results
are all over the map.

485
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,820
There's only one constant,
Iow HCT.

486
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,453
The anemia's real.
There's a million things

487
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,759
she could have taken
to have done that.

488
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,527
True, it could just be her MO.

489
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,798
She self-induces
two illnesses. One always
changes, one never does.

490
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,136
Or maybe she has Munchausen's
and aplastic anemia,

491
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,902
which would mean,
without proper treatment,

492
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,534
she'II continue
to get sicker, weaker,

493
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,171
eventually she'II start
bleeding internally and die.

494
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,215
She's not getting sicker.
She will.

495
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,580
If her bone marrow was dying,
the entire blood panel
would be affected.

496
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,415
Her white count's normal.
HOUSE: So far.

497
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,920
We need to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

498
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,013
No. No more tests.

499
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,923
Look, you kick her to the curb
with a Munchausen's diagnosis

500
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,655
you're guaranteeing
that no doctor will
ever Iisten to her again.

501
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,459
We do more tests,
we'II only be feeding
her psychosis.

502
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,126
The more attention
we give her,
the more she'II want.

503
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,933
What if she doesn't know
we're testing her?

504
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,565
House, you were wrong.
Live with it.

505
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,301
There's probably some
blood Ieft over
from previous tests.

506
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,777
BIood tests alone
can't confirm aplastic anemia.

507
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,974
Yes, I know.
That's why I want to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

508
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,947
But blood tests could show
a systemic disease.

509
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,452
A virus or a toxin
could be the cause.
Fine.

510
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,613
You want to test
the extra blood?
Knock yourself out.

511
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,316
But the patient is off-Iimits.

512
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,588
And if the results
are positive, I get my biopsy?

513
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,064
It's the safe way to go.

514
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,815
I need all of these tests
and a PCR done on this sample.

515
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,248
You're gonna need more blood.

516
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:31,886
Patient's empty.

517
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,720
Then I can't do it.

518
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,218
You can try.

519
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:40,731
I can try to Iook Iike
Salma Hayek, that's not
gonna make it happen.

520
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:49,336
You may not have Salma's ass,
but she doesn't have
your eyes.

521
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,941
Yeah, right.

522
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,513
How soon you need it?

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

524
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,286
Dr. Wilson, can I talk to you
about something in confidence?

525
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,255
Of course.
It's about House.

526
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,813
Oh, then no.

527
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,416
Fine. I won't say anything.

528
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,599
Do you think there's any way
House would take me seriously
as his boss?

529
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:21,133
Where is this coming from?
Did Cuddy say something?

530
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,264
We talked. She intimated.

531
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,806
And you want my advice
on how to usurp him?

532
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,678
It's very ancient Rome,
you'II need a toga,
of course, a sword.

533
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,742
It's not a coup. I just
want to figure out some way
we can work together.

534
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,854
I mean, I keep the team
running from an administrative
point of view,

535
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,322
House doesn't have
to deal with the red tape.
It's a win-win.

536
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,155
I'm sure
he'II see it that way.

537
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,329
Do you have any advice
on how to approach him?

538
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,591
How to deal the guy?

539
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,825
No.

540
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,202
But you won't tell him
we talked?

541
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,303
No.

542
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:00,105
There is no way
this is going to happen.

the most common viral cause
of aplastic anemia.

546
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,093

(CONTINUES SINGING VARIATION

You see that in sickle cell.

Not all sickle cell
patients are black.

552
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,580
None of her other blood panels
showed any sign
of sickle cell, which means

553
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:48,354
either something's changed
drastically since yesterday,
or this isn't her blood.

554
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,018
Of course it is.

555
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,687
Metaphorically.

556
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,390
Look, I couldn't do the tests.

557
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,403
I tried, but there wasn't
enough blood Ieft over.

558

If you'd just Iet me
do the biopsy.

559
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,700
CHASE: No way.

560
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,334
I just got back
from a suspension.

561
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,278
And if it wasn't for me,
you would've been fired.

562
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,508
Why don't you just
get the sample yourself?

what your boss said?

564
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,878
I don't care
what anybody says,
I care what they do.

Right now BIackpoleon
BIackaparte has got
the nurses on red alert.

Can't.

571
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,768
I'm not afraid of Foreman,
I agree with him.

You do realize that
BIackaparte's reign
is only temporary.

574
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:48,409
I also realize that no matter
what I do, you're still gonna
treat me Iike crap.

575
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,821
"Crap" is a relative term.

576
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,623
I never even made it
to the room.

577
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,793
Nurses called the attending
as soon as a trocar
was ordered.

578
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,036

discharge papers.

587

What?
Sit.

588
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,388
Why?

589
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,192
So you don't crack your skull
when you pass out.

590
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,200
Just do it.

591
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,834
You know what colchicine is?

592
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:42,964
No.

593
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,305
Well, don't feel bad.
It's for gout.

594
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,243
It's got nothing to do
with anything you've ever
pretended to have.

595
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,371
I'm not pretending to...

596
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,812
Shut up.

597
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,379
Colchicine decimates
your white blood cells.

598
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,885
Leaves almost no trace.

599
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,785
It's great for faking
your way into hospitals.

600
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,983
I didn't fake my way...
Shut up.

601
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,593
You've been
doing this for years.

602
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,828
Don't worry,
it's probably not your fault.

603
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,356
When you were a kid,
you had a close relative

604
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,198
who had a chronic disease,
probably your sister.

605
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,734
And you saw all the attention
she got while you were
Ieft alone, ignored.

606
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,601
And it really,
seriously screwed you up.

607
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,707
I do not have a relative...
Shut up!

608
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,375
I'm trying to give you
what you want.

609
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,852
And save your Iife.

610
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,018
You have aplastic anemia.

611
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,993
What, are you trying
to scare me now?

612
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,725
It means you're not
just sick in the head.

613
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,834
Problem is,
the rest of you appears well.

614
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,336
So I gotta make you seem
as sick as you're
supposed to be

615
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,065
by injecting you with a drug

616
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,664
that simulates the symptoms
that you actually have.

617
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,541
AII you need to know is,
you've hit the
Munchausen's jackpot.

618
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:03,349
I'm gonna give you
a cocktail of insulin
for seizure and colchicine

619
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,078
to kill your white count.

620
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,717
This will absolutely confirm
my diagnosis
of aplastic anemia.

621
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,626
There is one small catch.

622
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,691
If you've actually done
something to yourself
to cause the anemia,

623
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,291
then I'm wrong.

624
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,033
And if I do what I plan to do,

625
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,404
then the treatment
will kill you
instead of saving you.

626
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,770
So I need to know.

627
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,807
Have you been taking anything
besides the insulin, the ACTH,

628
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,745
and the pills
Cameron Ieft in your room?

629
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,781
No.

630
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,293
Good. Give me your arm.

631
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,964
It was my mom.

632
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,341
She had MS.

633
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,669
She was in and out
of hospitals all the time.

634
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,344
People were always trying
to do things for her.

635
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,385
Bring her food,
or brush her hair,
or make her happy.

636
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,523
People cared.

637
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,396
She died when I was 16.

638
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,434
Then there was no one.

639
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,264
Boo-hoo.

640
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,775
Where are you going?

641
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,808
I obviously can't be around
when it happens.

642
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,216
Well, what are you gonna do,
you're just gonna...

643
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,311
Relax, you know the drill.

644
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,424
People walk by here
all the time, you'II be fine.

645
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,064
(THUDDING)

646
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,779
So, barely out the door
and she has another seizure.

647
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,185
She must have
somehow grabbed insulin
on the way out.

648
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,383
FOREMAN: Once she's stable,
we need to get her out of here

649
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,119
before she does more damage
to herself.

650
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,519
We can't.

651
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,861
Her white count's down.

652
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,657
Sorry, I missed that.

653
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,359
Hearing's been off since
the Ricky Martin concert,

654
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,631
some cholo
kicked me in the head.

655
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,673
White count, hematocrit,
and platelets are all off.

656
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,574
Her bone marrow's
shutting down. She actually
has aplastic anemia.

657
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,736
Say what?

658
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,212
AII her other Iabs
show nothing that would...

659
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:47,308
Labs, shmabs.
A good diagnostician
reads between the Iabs.

660
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,275
You were right.

661
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,322
Hey, we're not here
to play the blame game.

662
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,080
These things happen.

663
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,286
Sometimes doctors
send people out
on the street to die

664
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,261
after other doctors
have warned them

665
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,389
that they're sending people
out on the street to die.

666
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,957
There's no way you could know.

667
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,393
I'II go give her the news.

668
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,475
ANICA: Who are you?

669
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,773
I'm Dr. Foreman.
I'm in charge of your case.

670
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,076
You have aplastic anemia,

671
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,821
which means
your bone marrow
has shut down.

672
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,620
Your body can't make

673
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,820
Are you sure?

674
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,456
I went back and checked
your old records.
It makes sense.

675
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,064
The aplastic anemia's
apparently been
developing for months.

676
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,566
I'm sorry, we should
have caught it earlier.

677
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,800
So

678
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:48,406
it's not just the Iatest
white count that's
Ieading you to feel this...

679
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,346
I know this is scary.

680
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,511
But a bone marrow transplant
could cure you.

681
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,055
A marrow transplant
could kill me.

682
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,182
The other option
is weekly blood transfusions,

683
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,484
injections of GCSF.

684
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,862
It's a Iifelong regimen.

685
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,694
Yeah, I don't want that.

686
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,323
You sure?

687
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,565
I don't want to be cruel here,

688
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,700
but you've jumped through
a Iot of hoops to get
this sort of attention.

689
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,669
I just want to be healthy.

690
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,541
It's not so much fun
when you're actually sick.

691
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,845
No.

692
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:37,759
We'II check the registry.
See if there's a donor match.

693
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,330
Thank you.

694
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,940
We have to kill all the old
bone marrow before we give you
the new stuff.

695
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,705
You'II have no immune system.

696
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,875
We'II keep you
in a sterile room
for two weeks

697
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,145
to make sure
everything's dead, then we'II
give you the donor marrow.

698
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,312
It'II take
another couple weeks
until it takes hold.

in there?

Three minutes.
What's going on?

She doesn't have
aplastic anemia.

713

She has an infection.
No.

714
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,560

would be through the roof.
Hers is on the floor.

'Cause her self-inflicted
Cushing's suppressed
her immune system.

720
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,909
Stopped her
from having a fever,
hid the infection.

721
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,750

could cause the bruises,

724
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,520
Augmentin is a Iot safer than
destroying her immune system.

00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,086
Why don't we try that?

You're taking the safe course?
What's going on?

727
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,434
There's Iots of explanations
for a Iow white count.

728
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,802
Name one that fits her case.

729
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,114
Colchicine.

730
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,752
I figure that she'd
gotten her hands on it
and self-medicated.

731
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,493
That's brilliant of her.

against her will
just so you could be right?

where House went
behind your back

and KO'd the patient
with insulin and colchicine.

758

There was no reason
to suspect an infection.

it was an infection.

You would have done
the same thing I did.

she's got a problem.
