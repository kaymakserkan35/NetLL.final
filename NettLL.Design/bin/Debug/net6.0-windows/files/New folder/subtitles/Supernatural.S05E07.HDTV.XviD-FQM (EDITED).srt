1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,356
Hey, babe.

2
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:14,095
Hmm.

3
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:15,730
Nice to see you, too.

4
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:00,808
Honey?

5
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,711
Are you okay?

6
00:01:09,718 --> 00:01:10,885
Oh!

7
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,253
Aaaaaah!

8
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:15,256
Supernatural Season 5 Episode 7

9
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,801
You expect me to believe
you're CDC?

10
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,037
Excuse me?

11
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:31,372
It's just that
you're a day early.

12
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,040
First time in history
I haven't sat on my ass

13
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:34,208
<i>waiting for you people.</i>

14
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:35,810
New administration.

15
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:37,678
A change
you can believe in.

16
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:39,781
Right.

17
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:47,388
meet, Xavier.

18
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:50,591
Date of birth...
April 3, 1984.

19
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,693
I know.

20
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,495
I ran the DNA twice.

21
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:55,830
That's definitely him.

22
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:58,532
Well, he wasn't big
on the sunscreen, huh?

23
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,135
So, what's your theory?

24
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,704
All I know is,
decedent's male, 25 years old,

25
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:06,573
And he died of old age.

26
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,550
You were right about this one.
it's definitely a job.

27
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,085
Thought so.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,821
Any other stiffs in town?

29
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:21,255
Just the one body.

30
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,523
Anything else?

31
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:25,092
Couple missing persons,
but usual for a town this size.

32
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:26,260
Well, check 'em out.

33
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,995
You think
they're connected?

34
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,663
- Call it a hunch.
- you got it.

35
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,933
And, by the way,
how you doing?

36
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,067
Doing?

37
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,068
Yeah.

38
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:35,937
You know,
just... in general?

39
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,239
<i>oh, you mean my legs.</i>

40
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,375
Well, I'm just weepin'
in my Haagen-Dazs.

41
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,077
Idjit.

42
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:55,957
That's the most recent.

43
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,527
How long
has he been missing?

44
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:01,762
Oh, I knew right away

45
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:03,464
When he didn't come
home, Tuesday night.

46
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:06,500
Is there someplace he likes
to go after work, maybe?

47
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:07,701
A favorite bar?

48
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:08,802
no.

49
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:11,105
Tuesdays, he always works
a bit late,

50
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,107
But he always
comes straight home.

51
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:16,777
May I use
your facilities, ma'am?

52
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,501
"working late," my ass.

53
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,703
Well, at least
he's consistent.

54
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:44,872
Same room every Tuesday,
hourly rates.

55
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:47,441
Hope I got that kind of kick
when I'm his age.

56
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:49,877
<i>yeah, like either of us
will live that long.</i>

57
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:51,512
True.

58
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,981
So...
what do you think's in there?

59
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,083
A wrinkly,
gooey corpse.

60
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,130
oh, my god!
oh, god no!

61
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:10,631
Oh! oh, god!

62
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,666
Hey, what the...

63
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:14,835
Oh. god.

64
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,638
It's gooey.

65
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:19,873
Sorry. uh...

66
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:21,742
Got the wrong room.

67
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,077
Close the door!

68
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:24,812
Hey.

69
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:28,249
Nice tattoo.

70
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:32,119
Happen to know anybody
named, Cliff Whitlow?

71
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:34,989
Never heard of him.

72
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:36,857
Well, that's weird.

73
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:38,859
'cause you're carrying
his wallet.

74
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:44,198
Huh.

75
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:46,800
Your wife told us
about your, uh, birthmark there.

76
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:48,202
That's nice.

77
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:49,870
<i>well,
you look great, cliff.</i>

78
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:51,505
Did you get
some work done?

79
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,809
Could you give us
some privacy?

80
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,816
Thanks.

81
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,485
Thanks.

82
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,519
Bye.

83
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,254
- Please don't tell my wife.
- Slow down.

84
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,190
I'm begging you.
as far as she knows, I'm dead.

85
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:10,824
For the love of god,
let's keep it that way.

86
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,259
<i>how can you possibly
be, Cliff Whitlow?</i>

87
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:13,760
I can't tell you.

88
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:15,496
Well, either you tell us
or we tell the missus.

89
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,597
Okay! okay!

90
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,632
It was a game.

91
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,234
Like... Xbox?

92
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,836
What's Xbox?

93
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:25,172
No. poker... high-stakes.

94
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:27,441
Instead of cash,
you play for years.

95
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:29,043
What is that
supposed to mean?

96
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:30,744
Look, I know
it sounds crazy.

97
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:33,414
Guy comes up to me at a bar,
invites me to play.

98
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:35,983
Gives me 25 of these
weirdo poker chips, right?

99
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,951
Chants some mumbo humbo
over them,

100
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:39,553
<i>says now
they're 25 years.</i>

101
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:41,955
I'm laughing...

102
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,624
But then I come out up.

103
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:45,192
And look at me.

104
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:46,894
- What was he chanting?
- How should I know?

105
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,462
All I know is,
my bad hip's good,

106
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:49,696
I threw away
my glasses.

107
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:51,598
one of those ladies
was here for free!

108
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,367
Man's some kind
of miracle worker.

109
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,236
What does this miracle
worker look like?

110
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,504
Just a guy.

111
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:58,605
Maybe 35, brown hair.

112
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,541
Irish accent.
his name was, Patrick.

113
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:01,942
All right, all right.
where's this game at?

114
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:05,212
He said he likes to keep moving.
never stays in one bar long.

115
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,847
<i>and he finds you.</i>

116
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,716
Thank you, Cliff.

117
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,690
Oh, and uh...

118
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,892
Stay classy.

119
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,364
It sounds crazy,
right?

120
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,066
no.
there's lore on it.

121
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,967
Goes back centuries.

122
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,036
Traveling card player
pops into town.

123
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:31,372
You beat him,
you get your best years back.

124
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,307
<i>'course, most folks lose.</i>

125
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:35,242
Well, that would explain
the crunchy corpse.

126
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,411
Supposedly, this player's
a hell of a card shark.

127
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:39,447
Got a lot of years
in the bank.

128
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,182
You find the bar
he's working in yet?

129
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:42,849
There's a lot of dives
in this town.

130
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:44,351
We're gonna have to
split up.

131
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,554
<i>well, why you still
talking to me?</i>

132
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,133
find anything?

133
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,202
Yeah, a whole bunch
of squat. you?

134
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:03,504
- No, not a thing.
- All right, well

135
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,640
you come up dry,
circle back to the motel in two.

136
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:08,675
Your turn
to grab dinner.

137
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,711
Usual, extra bacon.

138
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:12,713
Can I get a beer?

139
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,515
Yep.

140
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:16,683
You wouldn't happen to know
of a poker game

141
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:19,220
Going on in back,
would you?

142
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:22,022
It's a bar,
not a casino.

143
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:27,060
My friend, Ben
told me you'd know.

144
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,862
Don't know any, Ben.

145
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:30,131
Sure you do.

146
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:33,734
You know, balding, smart-ass,
real ladies' man?

147
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:35,802
Listen, pal,
I told you...

148
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:37,171
I don't know any, Ben.

149
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,406
I don't know nothing
about a game.

150
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,708
You sure?
'cause, uh...

151
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,012
he sure seems to know you.

152
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,218
'round back.
take the elevator down.

153
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:58,259
Bobby?

154
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:00,261
What the hell
are you doing here?

155
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,496
Planting daisies.
what's it look like?

156
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:04,097
Came in on the case.

157
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,766
<i>and you beat me here?</i>

158
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,537
Well, brains trumps legs,
apparently.

159
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,971
So, you found the game?

160
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:11,972
Yep.

161
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,674
Did you stop it?

162
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,309
Bobby?

163
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:21,848
Not exactly.

164
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:23,917
What did you do?

165
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,153
I played, okay?

166
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:31,892
And?

167
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:33,661
I lost.

168
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:36,662
Are you kidding me?

169
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,695
You played
some... some he-witch?

170
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,296
Don't you take
that tone with me.

171
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:42,464
You idiot!

172
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,433
<i>they're my years!
I can do what I want!</i>

173
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,067
How many did you lose?

174
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:49,904
25.

175
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:59,414
We're not done.

176
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:03,485
So, you're saying
that you're a mind reader.

177
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,520
ah, come on.
no such thing.

178
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:08,957
<i>but I can read people.</i>

179
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,593
Take your lovely
companion here.

180
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:14,896
I'd say, judging
from her exquisite posture,

181
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,732
She used to be
a dancer.

182
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,835
Not much of a drinker.

183
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:21,870
Very independent.

184
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,941
Looking for adventure.

185
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,878
Hey, man.

186
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:30,945
Excuse me.

187
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,881
Can I borrow you
for a sec?

188
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,918
Oh, yeah.
of course. great.

189
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,687
Good to see you.

190
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:41,623
Would you two
please excuse me?

191
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:45,861
Sorry to cut you short

192
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,596
With Mr. and Mrs. easy marks
over there.

193
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,663
Oh, no big.

194
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,732
Wasn't a total loss.

195
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:55,003
Look, I don't know what it is
you think I did

196
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,505
To your wife
or girlfriend,

197
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,673
Mother or sister,

198
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,777
But, uh, I just want you
to know, my feelings were real.

199
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,712
That ain't my problem,
man-witch.

200
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,447
You owe my friend
some years.

201
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,749
Oh, that's what this is.

202
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:09,885
I'm sorry. He lost.

203
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,185
Them's the breaks.

204
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,654
Well, then un-lose him.

205
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,460
Oh, go ahead
and shoot me,

206
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,862
If it makes you
feel better.

207
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:23,565
Besides, I could use a good...

208
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,934
You know... tickle.

209
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:30,539
You want years?
great.

210
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:31,873
Play me for 'em.

211
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:33,141
Fine.

212
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,342
Dean, no!

213
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:36,445
they're my years.
I can do what I want.

214
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:40,649
Lozenge?

215
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:44,152
What?
it's barely linty.

216
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,355
Okay, well, suit yourself.
just trying to help.

217
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:50,425
All right, all right.
come on. let's do this.

218
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,060
You understand
the terms?

219
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:08,042
Buy-in's 25 years.

220
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:11,713
Make it 50.

221
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,418
I like
the cut of your jib.

222
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:35,537
<i>lannraich
gu dealrach a-nis.</i>

223
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:47,281
25.

224
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:48,750
That's 25 years.

225
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,852
<i>they go to him.</i>

226
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,487
And he's cashing out.

227
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:54,455
- Dean!
- Bobby.

228
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:57,692
You sure?

229
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:58,994
Yes.

230
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,770
<i>las suas agus cuir
ás an teine.</i>

231
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,606
<i>mar sin bitheadh.</i>

232
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,429
That's 25 years
you just pissed away.

233
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,700
Better be sure
you can win them back.

234
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:44,739
Shuffle up and deal.

235
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,013
This is gonna be fun.

236
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,620
Hey, Dean?

237
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,088
You find anything?

238
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:01,556
Uh, you might say.

239
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:05,093
Who the hell are you?!

240
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,828
Dude, relax.

241
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:08,029
It's me.

242
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,199
Dean?

243
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,300
Hi.

244
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:15,570
What the hell happened?

245
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:18,539
I, you know...
found the game.

246
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:19,774
You f...

247
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,943
<i>I thought you said
you were g-good at poker.</i>

248
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:23,678
I am. shut up.

249
00:13:23,713 --> 00:13:27,082
So, you were just gonna shoot
some old guy? is that it?

250
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,618
<i>I didn't know what you were.
I mean, h-have you seen you?</i>

251
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:30,819
You look like...

252
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,021
The old chick in "Titanic."
I know. shut up.

253
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,090
I was gonna say
"Emperor Palpatine."

254
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:44,032
I see you met
John McCain there.

255
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:46,400
Yeah. either of you
want to tell me what happened?

256
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:48,402
Bobby's an idiot.
that's what happened.

257
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:50,138
Hey, nobody
asked you to play.

258
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,040
Right. I should have
just let you die.

259
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:53,708
<i>and for damn sure,
nobody asked you to lose!</i>

260
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:55,010
It's like
"grumpy old men."

261
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,044
- Shut up, Sam!
- Shut up, Sam!

262
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,613
What the hell
were you thinking?

263
00:13:58,648 --> 00:13:59,881
He's a witch.

264
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:02,917
He's been playing poker
since guys wore tights.

265
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:04,452
You just don't get it.

266
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:05,987
Yeah, I get it, Bobby.

267
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:08,222
You saw a chance to turn
the hands of the clock back

268
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:09,958
And get out
of that damn chair.

269
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:11,893
Pretty tempting.

270
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,394
I can imagine.

271
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:15,563
<i>No, you can't.</i>

272
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,431
You got me.

273
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:19,400
I never been paralyzed.

274
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,202
But I tell you something...
I've been to hell,

275
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,906
And there's an archangel there
wanting me to drop the soap.

276
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,542
Look at me!
my junk's rustier than yours!

277
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,943
<i>you hear me bellyaching?
huh?</i>

278
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:30,411
A-actually, yeah.

279
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,716
Oh!

280
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:39,320
I'm having a heart attack.

281
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:40,789
No, you're not.

282
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:43,357
What is it?

283
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,993
Acid reflux.

284
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:47,228
Guys your age
can't digest certain foods.

285
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,331
You're gonna need
to put down that cheeseburger.

286
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,808
So, you want
to keep emoting

287
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,777
Or you want to talk about
solving this little issue of yours?

288
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:04,579
It's got to be
about the chips.

289
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:10,985
I slid 'em across,

290
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,855
Patrick did
his little witchy number,

291
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,690
And you prettied up
in a hurry.

292
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:17,158
I mean, what are you all thinking?

293
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:18,693
Some kind of magic chips
or something?

294
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:19,928
Definitely.

295
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,963
- You remember what he chanted?
- Yep, every word.

296
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:24,365
All right, then let's find out
where he stashes his chips.

297
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,035
And steal me 50.

298
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:30,105
Benjamin Button me
back into burger shape.

299
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,140
what do you think?

300
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:34,976
I think you ought to
put some clothes on.

301
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,618
Ready for housekeeping, sir?

302
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,654
Born ready.

303
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:50,158
you're just like
my grandfather.

304
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,827
He hits on
anything that moves, too.

305
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:54,362
You're adorable.

306
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:55,730
And dangerous.

307
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,031
Aww.

308
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,476
Can we just go?

309
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,634
guys, get some help!
he came out of nowhere!

310
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:44,212
What the hell?

311
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:46,514
I got to say,

312
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,050
I kind of like
the guy.

313
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:31,059
<i>well, I'm out.</i>

314
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,738
Dean...

315
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:00,048
Sam?

316
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:05,621
Dime-store model.

317
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:07,589
Piece of cake.

318
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:16,565
It's "mission pathetic", watch out.

319
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,940
<i>I could have done that.</i>

320
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,447
What are you doing?

321
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:36,251
Aren't you
the chick from the bar?

322
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:38,920
I'm a lot more
than that.

323
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,291
It's all right,
sweetheart.

324
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:44,226
It's all right.
they're harmless.

325
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,799
You boys want chips?
take 'em.

326
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,134
They're just chips, Einsteins.

327
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:54,469
It's show-manship.

328
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,004
This may
come as a shock,

329
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,873
But the magic does not lie
in a pile of crappy plywood

330
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:01,943
Or in any phony abracadabra.

331
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:05,647
It's in the 900-year-old witch.

332
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,283
You boys want years?

333
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:11,152
Score 'em
the old-fashioned way.

334
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:12,654
Texas hold 'em.

335
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,690
Fine. let's do it.

336
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:21,096
What card
am I holding up?

337
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,033
That's what I thought.

338
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:28,237
If your eyesight's that bad,
what about your memory?

339
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:30,171
I'm not a murderer.

340
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:33,308
You, on the other hand...

341
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,910
No, Sam.
Dean...

342
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:37,679
What, Sam not
much of a player?

343
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,817
Okay, well,
happy trails, Dean.

344
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:46,788
Enjoy the twilight
of your life.

345
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:49,625
Should have taken better care
of that ticker, though.

346
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:55,130
You're free to go.

347
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,003
Oh, but, Sam...

348
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:03,838
Your brother's situation...

349
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:05,641
That's punishment enough,

350
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:08,176
But I can't let you leave

351
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,512
Without a small parting gift.

352
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:16,418
What are you doing?

353
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:19,187
You'll find out
soon enough.

354
00:21:19,221 --> 00:21:22,357
Let's get out of here, Sam.

355
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,738
Dude...

356
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,408
I believe that he-witch
gave you the clap.

357
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:56,518
little help here?

358
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,060
You know,
I still think I should play.

359
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:06,161
No, no, no.

360
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:07,596
You're not good enough.

361
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:09,698
<i>I'm better.
Bobby's way better.</i>

362
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,333
<i>we both lost.</i>

363
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:12,501
Exactly.

364
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,069
So, what? so I don't get a say
in this anymore?

365
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:15,671
Sammy, when you get
to be our age...

366
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:17,072
You're 30, Dean!

367
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:19,341
Look, I've watched you hustle
plenty of poker...

368
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,110
Knowing the game
is not enough, Sam.

369
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:22,277
It's not about
playing the cards.

370
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:24,279
- It's about playing the other guy.
- I know that.

371
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:25,714
Well, hooray for you.

372
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:28,216
All I'm saying is,
I played this guy.

373
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:29,918
I know his style.
I can take him.

374
00:22:29,953 --> 00:22:32,387
No, Bobby. you don't have
enough years in the bank.

375
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:33,689
I got enough.

376
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:35,323
No, you'll die
if you lose, Bobby.

377
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,259
So what if I do, huh?

378
00:22:37,293 --> 00:22:40,495
<i>what exactly
am I living for, huh?!</i>

379
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,397
The damn apocalypse?!

380
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:45,668
Watching men die bloody
while I sit in this chair,

381
00:22:45,702 --> 00:22:47,036
Can't take a step
to help 'em?

382
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,236
Bobby...

383
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:51,106
No, no.
it's the facts.

384
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:53,575
I'm old...

385
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,044
And broke down...

386
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:57,245
and I can't...

387
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:03,251
I ain't a hunter
no more.

388
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:06,421
I'm useless.

389
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:10,125
And if I wasn't
such a coward,

390
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,760
I'd have stuck a gun
in my mouth

391
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:13,595
Day I got home
from the hospital.

392
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:24,272
Bobby, you are not
playing again.

393
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:27,375
I'm not... letting you do that.

394
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,079
There's another way
out of this. there's got to be.

395
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:31,646
And I'm gonna find it.

396
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:47,395
Take it.

397
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,764
It'll help you.

398
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:55,871
What is this?

399
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:58,373
The most powerful reversal spell
you've ever laid your eyes on.

400
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,642
And it reverses what?

401
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:02,577
Patrick's work... all of it.

402
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:05,480
You... you saying
I could be normal again?

403
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:08,217
You and everyone else
he's ever played.

404
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:09,818
Who's still alive.

405
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:13,488
Why the hell
should we trust you?

406
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:15,858
Trust me, don't trust me.
I don't care.

407
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:17,259
The spell is real.

408
00:24:17,293 --> 00:24:20,863
If it zaps everyone,
don't that include your man?

409
00:24:20,897 --> 00:24:22,530
And me, too.

410
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:24,399
I look good for my age.

411
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,735
Lady, this don't
add up for squat.

412
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,737
Why would you want that?

413
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:30,773
I have my reasons.

414
00:24:35,011 --> 00:24:36,178
Do it quick.

415
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:38,147
We leave town tomorrow.

416
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,178
Bet.

417
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:14,349
I sense you've got me
by the jewels on this one, Hesh.

418
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:17,752
I fold.

419
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,726
What are you up...
like 13 years there, Hesh?

420
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:27,395
What do you say
we call it a day?

421
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:32,234
Thanks, Patrick.

422
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:33,468
Hesh here is gonna live

423
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:35,537
To see his grand-daughter's
bar mitzvah.

424
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:36,939
Isn't that right, Hesh?

425
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:38,140
Ohhh.

426
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:39,274
Thanks again, Patrick.

427
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,876
Shalom, my friend. Shalom.

428
00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:49,318
That was nice of you.

429
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:51,419
I'm a nice guy.

430
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,723
What can I do you for?

431
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:03,431
Deal.

432
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:14,809
Jawbone of a murderer.
great.

433
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,747
You know,
this really sucks.

434
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:20,715
How do we even know
her spell's gonna work?

435
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,485
We don't.
but we ain't got a plan "B."

436
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,588
Now, less flappin'
and more diggin'.

437
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:28,257
Oh, god!

438
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:31,493
My elbows!
I'm all creaky.

439
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:33,628
Hurry up, you cry baby.

440
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:35,830
Pound it up your ass, Ironsides.

441
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,268
One little grave.

442
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:42,037
<i>then you do it.</i>

443
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:44,072
Fine. I'll hop right in.

444
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:45,640
Well, least your legs
are numb.

445
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:47,842
Shut up and dig, grandma.

446
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:48,911
Oh!

447
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:50,745
Now it's my back!

448
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,414
Can you straighten up?

449
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:54,516
Yeah, but a little sympathy
wouldn't hurt.

450
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,817
Butt cheek tingling?

451
00:26:55,851 --> 00:26:58,921
Well, that's
kind of personal.

452
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:01,089
So "yeah"?

453
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:03,658
It's sciatica. you'll live.
keep digging.

454
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:04,859
You know, Bobby...

455
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:07,195
Killing you is officially
on my bucket list.

456
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,935
I like you, Sam. I do.

457
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:16,571
You're smart, and your heart's
clearly in the right place.

458
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:21,076
I can tell a lot about a guy
by looking.

459
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:24,246
You mean you're psychic.

460
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,415
No. That'd be cheating.

461
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:31,053
I'm talking about
good old-fashioned intuition.

462
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:32,821
Right. Let's just play.

463
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:35,690
<i>we are playing.</i>

464
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:39,828
Does your big brother
know you're here?

465
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,099
Bet five.

466
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:46,701
Didn't think so.

467
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:50,072
I raise.

468
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:54,776
Here you are, right...

469
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,080
<i>trying to clean up
their mess,</i>

470
00:27:58,114 --> 00:28:00,615
And they still want to sit you
at the kiddie table.

471
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:07,255
You're not the little brother
anymore, Sam.

472
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,690
Then again...

473
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:11,259
<i>maybe you are.</i>

474
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:14,796
You're in over
your head here, Sam.

475
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,466
I mean, you can keep
making these moves...

476
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,634
You know...

477
00:28:19,668 --> 00:28:21,103
Playing it cautious,

478
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:23,472
Playing the percentages.

479
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:26,174
But I'm still gonna kick
your ass into the nursing home.

480
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:28,377
Does this arm-chair
psychology routine

481
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:29,744
usually work for you?

482
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,680
<i>you tell me.</i>

483
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:35,283
You're the one
who's losing.

484
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:03,978
Little break?

485
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:08,316
How's it going
in there?

486
00:29:09,352 --> 00:29:10,652
<i>how do you think
it's going?</i>

487
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:12,620
What about you?
you have everything you need?

488
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:15,657
We still need
a little he-witch DNA.

489
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:17,025
He was chewing it.

490
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,560
Hurry up, Dean. Please.

491
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:20,628
All right.
just keep him busy.

492
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:23,198
And, Sammy...

493
00:29:23,232 --> 00:29:24,966
Don't lose.

494
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:54,829
<i>gairmidh mi air maponus,
dia na hogalachd.</i>

495
00:29:54,863 --> 00:30:00,168
<i>gairmidh mi air sucellus,
dia na time.</i>

496
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:08,743
<i>till an-dràsda obair uile
gu bheilair a bhith deànta.</i>

497
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:11,580
<i>mar sin bitheadh.</i>

498
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:13,081
Drop it in.

499
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:23,891
Well?

500
00:30:23,926 --> 00:30:25,427
How do I look?

501
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:30,064
Question...

502
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:33,001
Is this what you meant
to give your big brother?

503
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:39,207
The one you gave him
never passed my lips.

504
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:41,376
Won't do a scrap of good.

505
00:30:44,313 --> 00:30:47,048
I don't like
cheating, Sam.

506
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:00,650
Stop it! Patrick, let him go!

507
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:01,918
He tried to kill us!

508
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:04,254
<i>I did it!
I gave him the spell!</i>

509
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:08,024
What?

510
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:15,499
Why...

511
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,000
Why would you do that?

512
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:18,835
You know why.

513
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,807
You know.

514
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:42,793
Keep... playing.

515
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,800
Everything we put
in that spell was kosher.

516
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:52,536
Yeah, everything
except the damn toothpick.

517
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,338
You got to go get
a speck of DNA.

518
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,040
Strap on
your track shoes.

519
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:59,208
Oh, goody.

520
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:00,777
More stairs.

521
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:07,818
It's too damn clean
in here.

522
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,285
First witch
I ever heard of

523
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,488
Didn't spew bodily fluids
all over the place.

524
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:13,957
Toothbrush, comb... anything.

525
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:19,062
Well, look at you...

526
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:21,965
The percentage player
betting the farm.

527
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,900
Awful transparent
of you, Sam.

528
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:27,737
I mean, if I had a monster hand
like you have,

529
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:29,473
I'd trap you.

530
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:31,875
But you get so excited,

531
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,344
You bet yourself
right out of a big pot.

532
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:39,816
I fold.

533
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:43,152
Set of ladies,
I'm guessing.

534
00:32:54,632 --> 00:32:56,500
Nice bluff.

535
00:32:56,534 --> 00:33:00,370
If we had time, I could make
a real player out of you.

536
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:02,539
I got time.

537
00:33:04,141 --> 00:33:05,709
Maybe.

538
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:08,277
But I can't say the
same for, Dean.

539
00:33:08,312 --> 00:33:10,146
Your brother's
gonna be dead soon.

540
00:33:11,582 --> 00:33:15,418
And when I say "soon"...

541
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,420
<i>I mean minutes.</i>

542
00:33:24,094 --> 00:33:25,896
The game's not over
till I say it is.

543
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:28,565
Blinds.

544
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:45,248
So, when it's about
your brother,

545
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:46,917
You get so emotional,

546
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:48,952
Your brain just flies
right out the window.

547
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,286
Good to know.

548
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,454
Go to hell.

549
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:55,725
I'm all-in.

550
00:33:59,764 --> 00:34:01,064
Don't do that, Sam.

551
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:02,599
I can't leave
until it's over?

552
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:04,400
Fine. it's over.

553
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:05,902
Now, where's my brother?

554
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:08,104
Look, there's poker
and then there's suicide.

555
00:34:08,138 --> 00:34:09,272
Just play the hand.

556
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:11,007
Dean? Dean, you there?

557
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:16,980
Fine.

558
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,083
Dean?!

559
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:40,269
I'm sorry, kid.

560
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:43,506
Aces full.

561
00:34:58,522 --> 00:35:00,056
You're crying.

562
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:07,463
For a witch, you're so nice,
it's actually kind of creepy.

563
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:10,399
It's okay.

564
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:14,704
It was a great hand.

565
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,340
Just...

566
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:21,277
not as great...

567
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:27,717
as four 4s.

568
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:41,230
Well played.

569
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:44,834
You know, that whole...

570
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:46,936
Going out of your head bit...

571
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:48,237
Very method.

572
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:52,308
Well, there's more to you
than meets the eye.

573
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,378
Cash these in for, Dean,
please.

574
00:35:58,082 --> 00:35:59,282
With pleasure.

575
00:35:59,316 --> 00:36:00,650
Dean, you hear me?

576
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:04,054
Damn it, Dean!

577
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:19,002
Idjit.

578
00:36:21,003 --> 00:36:23,003
I can't do this.

579
00:36:23,244 --> 00:36:24,778
Yes, you can.

580
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:26,447
Don't make me.

581
00:36:27,748 --> 00:36:29,083
I don't want to win.

582
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:37,224
I buried my daughter.

583
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:39,460
And she looked like this.

584
00:36:41,162 --> 00:36:42,762
It's not natural.

585
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:53,474
You know...

586
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:55,609
When you decided
to come with me.

587
00:36:57,245 --> 00:36:59,879
This is what you wanted.

588
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,249
You're still young.

589
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:04,351
You're so beautiful.

590
00:37:04,385 --> 00:37:05,486
<i>you have me.</i>

591
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,020
I miss my family.

592
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:10,357
I'm sorry, Patrick.

593
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:12,426
I thought you loved me.

594
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,694
I do.

595
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:17,331
Sweetheart,
of course I do.

596
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:20,066
I thought
I was cut out for this,

597
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:21,201
But I'm not.

598
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:23,370
I don't think I can do this
without you.

599
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:27,174
You got on okay for a long time
before you met me.

600
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:31,845
Check.

601
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:40,754
All-in.

602
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,668
All-in.

603
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:18,292
Thank you.

604
00:38:31,673 --> 00:38:35,209
No tricks, you
actually beat the guy?

605
00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:37,911
How the hell?

606
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:39,580
Just lucky.

607
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:43,083
Hey. I'll see
y'all guys later.

608
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:44,218
Where you going?

609
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:45,285
Uh...

610
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,453
Mmm, nowhere.

611
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:51,558
A booster shot.

612
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:53,159
Don't say it.

613
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:59,999
well, I guess
we can get the van loaded.

614
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,673
I shouldn't have
called you an idiot.

615
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,907
Which time?

616
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:11,878
I'm sorry.

617
00:39:11,912 --> 00:39:14,080
I mean,
I actually... I-I...

618
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:16,216
I get it.

619
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:19,219
Getting old
ain't a bachelor party.

620
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:21,221
<i>and dealing with the crap
you got to deal with...</i>

621
00:39:21,256 --> 00:39:23,123
Don't you go
on pity patrol.

622
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,190
I'm not.

623
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:26,293
I'm not. I'm just...

624
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:28,128
I'm saying, you know,
if I was in your shoes...

625
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:30,631
You'd never
stop complaining.

626
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:34,468
Fair enough.

627
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:39,105
You're not useless, Bobby.

628
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:41,608
Okay.

629
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:43,076
Good talk.

630
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,612
No, wait a minute.
listen to me.

631
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,022
You don't stop
being a soldier

632
00:39:56,056 --> 00:39:59,058
'cause you got wounded
in battle.

633
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:00,059
Okay?

634
00:40:00,094 --> 00:40:01,528
No matter
what shape you're in,

635
00:40:01,562 --> 00:40:03,897
Bottom line is,
you're family.

636
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,465
I don't know
if you've noticed,

637
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,401
But me and Sam,
we don't have much left.

638
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:12,038
I can't do this
without you.

639
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:15,208
I can't.

640
00:40:16,844 --> 00:40:20,814
So don't you dare
think about checking out.

641
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:22,849
I don't want
to hear that again.

642
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:29,889
Okay.

643
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:31,257
Okay.

644
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:35,529
Good.

645
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:42,803
Thanks.

646
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:45,138
Now, we done
feeling our feelings?

647
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:46,807
'cause I'd like
to get out of this room

648
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:48,575
Before we both start
growing lady parts.

649
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:51,878
Yeah, we're done.

650
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,626
Let's go, Ironsides.

651
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:08,729
<i>oh, that one's sticking,
huh?</i>
