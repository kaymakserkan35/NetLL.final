1
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
The radio
around here sucks.

2
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,852
Come on man.

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,700
Jobs don't get much t1der
than this, you know?

4
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,352
Dead vic with a gnawed-On neck,
body drained of blood,

5
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,100
And a witness who swears up
and down that it was a vampire.

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,300
No, I agree.
It's a hell of a case.

7
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,852
A little more gusto,
please.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,652
It's just...

9
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,952
The world
is coming to an end.

10
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,452
Things are a little complicated,
you know?

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,152
Yeah, well, we can't save the world,
not today anyway.

12
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,700
But what we can do
is trup off some vamps' heads.

13
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,952
Come on, man,
it's like the good old days.

14
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,100
An honest-To-Goodness
monster hunt.

15
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,700
It's about time the Winchesters
got back to tackling

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,100
A straightforward,
black-And-White case.

17
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
We still got to see
the new "raiders" movie.

18
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Saw it.

19
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,300
Without me?

20
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
You were in hell.

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
That's no excuse.

22
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
Big pretzel!

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,200
Thank you.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you.

25
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,200
Guten tag.

26
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
"Guten tag" yourself.

27
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
Looks like
that's our man.

28
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,300
Sheriff Dietrich.

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Are you the boys
from the fed?

30
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,300
Angent anges and Young.

31
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,600
We called ahead about your,
uh, problem.

32
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,200
Right. Um...

33
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,352
I'll tell you what,

34
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Why don't we talk this out
away from the crowd, huh?

35
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,552
Marissa wright, 26,

36
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,800
Just up from lockhard
for the 'fest.

37
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Terrible.
Just terrible.

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,400
It's the last thing is town needs
at peak tourist season.

39
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,900
Definitely the last thing
Marissa wright needed.

40
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,052
What the hell?

41
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,552
Yeah, you got me --
I mean,

42
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,200
This killer's some kind
of grade-"A" wacko, right?

43
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,052
I mean, some satan-Worshipping,
anne rice-Reading,

44
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,300
Gothic,
psycho vampire wannabe.

45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,900
Sheriff, in your report,
you mentioned a witness.

46
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,352
Yeah,
I wished I didn't.

47
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,600
But our witness insisted.

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
That's Ed Brewer.

49
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,500
Not exactly
what you'd call reliable.

50
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,052
I remember you.

51
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,900
And I remember you...

52
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
"Jamie."

53
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,200
I never forget
a pretty...everything.

54
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,252
We're looking
for Ed Brewer.

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,900
What do you want
with Ed?

56
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,800
Well,
we are, uh...

57
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
...federal agents.

58
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,252
Mr. Brewer was witss to
a serious crime.

59
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,152
-We just --
-Wait a minute.

60
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,700
You're a fed?

61
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Wow, you don't come on
like a fed.

62
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,800
Seriously?

63
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
I'm a maverick, ma'am.

64
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
A rebewith a badge.

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,400
One thing I dot egay
by -- The rules.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, maverick.

67
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
So, where can we
find mr. Brewer?

68
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,600
I told the cops
everything I saw.

69
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,300
No one believes me.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,100
Why should you
be any different?

71
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Believe me, mr. Brewer,
we're different.

72
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,252
Psycho ????

73
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,552
And now,
the town is a joke.

74
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Marissa wright's murder
is no joke to us.

75
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,352
And we want to
hear everything,

76
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,052
No matter how strange
it may seem.

77
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,500
We have a lot of experience
with strange.

78
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,252
It was just
after midnight.

79
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,852
I just left here,
and like I do every night,

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,300
I cut through the park
on the way home.

81
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,052
At first, I thought it
was a couple kissing.

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,900
But she was...
struggling too much.

83
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,200
And this man,

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,200
He was -- Well,
he was biting her neck.

85
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,852
Can you describe
her assailant?

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Oh, he was a vampire.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,852
Okay, right.
And by that, you mean --

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,500
You know,
a vampire.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,052
-Uh-Huh.
-Yeah.

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,052
So, he looked like --

91
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,000
He looked like
a vampire,

92
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,852
You know, with the fangs
and the slicked-Back hair

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,852
And the fancy cape

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,800
And the little medallion thingy
on the ribbon.

95
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,252
You mean
like a dracula?

96
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,300
Exactly.
Like a dracula.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,252
Right down
to the accent.

98
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,300
-The ac.
-Yep.

99
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,500
What did he say?

100
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,000
You know,
something like..

101
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,100
"Stay away, mortal!
The night is mine!"

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,400
You do believe me,
don't you?

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,700
They must be here following up
on that murdered woman.

104
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,052
Crazy Ed
and vampire story.

105
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,400
He might be weird,
but he's not crazy.

106
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,852
Look,
you're just saying that

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,700
'Cause the guy has a crush on you
and he tips you in $20s.

108
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,100
Lucy.

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,352
So, you got a beer
back there for me?

110
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,352
I don't know, agent Young.
You off duty?

111
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,700
And then some.

112
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
So, what do you think?

113
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,752
Goth, psycho
vampire wannabe, right?

114
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,252
Definitely not
our kind of case.

115
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
Agreed.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
But who cares?

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,752
Room's paid for,
and it's oktoberfest.

118
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
Come on, brother.

119
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,852
Beer and bar wenches.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,500
Pretty sure women today don't react well
to the whole "wench" thing, Dean.

121
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,252
Hey, bar wench,
where's that beer?

122
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Coming up,
good sir!

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Dude, oktoberfest.

124
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,300
There you go.

125
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,700
What can I get you?

126
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,352
Oh, he doesn't drink.

127
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,652
He's a christian scientist.
Doesn't even take aspirin.

128
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
He's a real drag
on stakeouts.

129
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,300
You're funny.

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,952
I'm a re than that.

131
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,752
I'd love to get a chance
to show you the rest.

132
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,852
What time you
get off?

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Ha ha.
Like I said, "funny."

134
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,852
Man, it is time
to right some wrongs.

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,100
Come again?

136
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,700
Look at me.

137
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,352
I came back from the furnace without
any of my old scars, right?

138
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,100
You know, bullet wounds,
knife cuts,

139
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,252
None of the off-Angled fingers
from all the breaks.

140
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,452
I mean, my hide is as smooth
as a baby's bottom,

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,500
Which leads me
to conclude,

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
Sadly...

143
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,900
That my virginity is intact.

144
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:23,952
What?

145
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,300
-I have been re-Hymenated.
-Re--

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Please.

147
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,852
Dean, maybe angels
can pull you out of hell,

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,152
But no one
could do that.

149
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,152
Brother,
I have been re-Hymenated.

150
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,452
And the dude
will not abide.

151
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,852
All right, dude.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,752
Well, you go do
whatever you got to do,

153
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,352
And I'm gonna go back
to the room

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,800
And get some sleep.

155
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,952
So?
How about tonight?

156
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,952
Oh, sorry.

157
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,300
I promised Lucy
a girls' night out.

158
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,852
Besides,
no self-Respecting bar wench

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,952
Lets herself get picked up
by a customer on the first try.

160
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,852
Well, I'm not a customer.
I'm a federal agent.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,352
Try again tomorrow,
g-Man.

162
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,452
I wish I could.

163
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,752
I don't think
we're staying on the case.

164
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,300
What?
Is it too weird for you?

165
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,500
Not weird enough.

166
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,152
Rick.
Did you hear that?

167
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,752
What?

168
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,400
It sounded
like a wolf.

169
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,352
Come on, marie,
don't change the subject.

170
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,152
I told you what could happen
to a man if he doesn't --

171
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,252
Those stories aren't true.

172
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,252
They are.
Baby,

173
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,752
If a man doesn't get the stuff
out of his system regularly,

174
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,000
It can back up and cause
all kinds of...

175
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,200
Medical-Type problems.

176
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,400
Shh,
do you hear that?

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Anne marie, there aren't
any wolves in pennsylvania.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,200
And then it just -- It just tore
Rick into little pieces.

179
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
Ma'am, we understand
how hard this is,

180
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,000
But can you describe
the creature?

181
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,300
Oh.

182
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
It was a werewolf.

183
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,300
A werewolf?

184
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,952
You're sure?
Oh, yeah.

185
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,952
With the furry face
and the black nose

186
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,200
And the claws and the torn-Up
pants and shirt,

187
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,500
Like from
the old movies.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
Um, well...

189
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,500
Okay, so...

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,300
Thank you for your time.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,652
First a dracula and now
a full-On movie-Time wolf man?

192
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
What the hell is going on
in this town?

193
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,800
-Ohh.
-Whew.

194
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Damn!

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,900
All right.

196
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,500
Whatever did this
wasn't a psycho wannabe.

197
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,500
Look at
those bite marks.

198
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,900
Right down
to the bone...

199
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,600
And deeper.

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,252
Strong enough to tear a healthy man
apart limb from limb.

201
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,152
Could be a werewolf.

202
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,852
Yeah,
except, look.

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,152
The heart's still there
in one piece.

204
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,352
They never leave
the heart behind.

205
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,300
Thus I reiterate --
What the hell is going on?

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,300
Well, I was hoping you boys
could tell me.

207
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,252
I just got a rush job
back from the lab

208
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,600
On those fibers
we found on the body.

209
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,700
Canine.
Wolf hairs.

210
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm getting a headache.

211
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,352
I don't know, man.

212
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,352
Looks like we've stumbled on

213
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,900
To a midnight showing of
"dracula meets wolf man."

214
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,252
Is that it?

215
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,252
I don't know.

216
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,852
I mean, wolf man
seems real enough.

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,352
It makes dracula seem
a little less impossible, I guess.

218
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,852
Yeah, but werewolves
don't grow wolf hair.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
-That's just a myth.
-Yeah.

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,852
So, what?
We've got a vampire

221
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
And a werewolf
monster mashing this town?

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,100
Looked like you guys
are staying a while.

223
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,152
I heard
about Rick Deacon.

224
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,852
Yeah, this case
just got weird enough for,

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,400
Our department.

226
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
Well,
beers are on me.

227
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,000
And, just so you know,
I get off at midnight tonight.

228
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,800
Oh, it's not another, uh,
girls' night out?

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,300
Doesn't have to be.

230
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,652
Okay, then.
I'll see you tonight.

231
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay, then.

232
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,300
Hey, you think this dracula
could turn into a bat?

233
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,200
That would be cool.

234
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's right.

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,600
Yeah, an egyptian kind
of deal.

236
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,800
No, it was just sitting there
on the loading dock.

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,352
No, doctor,
there's no shipping invoice.

238
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,700
There's no nothing.

239
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,900
I don't know
any was deliver

240
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,352
They was chill
one o'clock in tonight.

241
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,200
I thought you wouldn't to do

242
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,500
You think Helen has
any record of it in her files?

243
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,700
Holy mother of crap!

244
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,500
No!

245
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
This sarcophagus
isn't ancient.

246
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
It's from a prop house
in philly.

247
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,900
Well...

248
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,552
It goes well with
the bucket of dry ice

249
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,000
He was keeping
in it.

250
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,252
Is he making
his own special effects?

251
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Yeah, a mummy with a good sense
of showmanship.

252
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,300
This is stupid.

253
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,552
Oh, damn it. Jamie.
I'm late.

254
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,652
You're good here
with the mummy and the...crazy

255
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,400
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

256
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,100
Your loss,
g-Man.

257
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,900
Good evening.

258
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,000
I have watched you
many nights from afar.

259
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,000
My passion knows
no bounds??!

260
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,300
You are the reincarnation
of my beloved,

261
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,700
And I must have you.

262
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,900
Mary,
son of a...

263
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,400
Jamie!

264
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,652
Son of a bitch.

265
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,852
You should not use
such language

266
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,100
In the presence
of my bride.

267
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,400
Okay.

268
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,652
Jamie, run!

269
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,352
You have no choice
in the matter, mr. Harker.

270
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,200
???

271
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,300
Hey.

272
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,252
You guys all right?

273
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,100
Yeah, I think so.

274
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,452
And I think I know
what's going on.

275
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,400
Yeah?

276
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
Part of it
at least.

277
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,952
Uh, the ear part?

278
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,700
Ripped it off
of dracula's head.

279
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Touch it.

280
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,300
Feel familiar to you?

281
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,452
Oh, man.

282
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,952
The skin
of a shapeshifter,

283
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,652
Just like st. Louis
and just like milwaukee.

284
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,500
Of course this one's all
holding buckets of crazy.

285
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,700
Oh, and, uh...

286
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,152
This must have fallen off
during the fight.

287
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,900
Look at the label
on the ribbon.

288
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,652
It's a costume rental.

289
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,552
All three monsters - The dracula,
wolf man, and the mummy --

290
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,652
All the same critter,

291
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,152
Which means we need to
catch this freak

292
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,152
Before he "creature from
the black lagoon's" somebody.

293
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,852
So, you guys are like mulder
and scully or something,

294
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,400
And the x files
are real?

295
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,452
No, "the x files"
is a tv show.

296
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,800
This is real.

297
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,200
Oh.

298
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,952
Okay, so, the stagecraft,
the costuming --

299
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,152
It's like he's trying to reenact
his favorite monster-Movie moments,

300
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,400
Right down
to the bloody murders.

301
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,552
Wait a second.
Who the hell is Mina?

302
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,900
-Mina?
-Yeah.

303
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,352
That's what he called Jamie.
And he called me mr. Harker.

304
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
Jonathan Harker?

305
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,300
They're characters from
the movies and the novels --

306
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,652
Mina,
dracula's intended bride,

307
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,100
Harker, the fianc ???

308
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,152
Seems like
he's fixating on you,

309
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Like he sees you
as his bride.

310
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,800
Wow.
Lucky me.

311
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,052
But to fixate on you,

312
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,852
My guess is that the shifter has to
have seen you before or been around you.

313
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,552
Jamie, has anybody strange
come to town,

314
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,852
Somebody that has taken
a specific notice of you?

315
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,652
I don't know, Dean.
It's oktoberfest.

316
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,852
I'm a bartender.
There's lots of people.

317
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,500
I...

318
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,852
Wait a second.
There is Ed.

319
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,300
"Ed Brewer" Ed?

320
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,900
Yeah.

321
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,352
He moved here
about a month ago.

322
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,700
Lucy swears
he has a crush on me.

323
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,200
He comes in
almost every night.

324
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,652
But, you know, I don't think
he's the type of guy --

325
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,000
Where does Ed live?

326
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,500
I don't know.

327
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,852
But he works
at the old movie theater.

328
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,600
I think
he's a projectionist there.

329
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
-Take care of Mina?
-Yep.

330
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,100
So, monsters are real.

331
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,952
Some of them, yeah.

332
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,152
And the shapeshifter,

333
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,200
He can turn
into different people.

334
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,152
Yeah.

335
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,852
Yeah,except this one's turning into
the great monstersof screenland,

336
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,700
Which is a new one
for me.

337
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,100
You're not really fbi,
are you?

338
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
Not so much.

339
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,352
So,
this is what you do?

340
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,752
You and your partner
just tramp across the country

341
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,852
On your own dime

342
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,100
Until you find some
horrible nightmare to fight?

343
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,000
Some people paint.

344
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,800
What?

345
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,552
That must suck.

346
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,600
I mean, you're giving up
your life for this terrible...

347
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,900
I don't know,
responsibilit

348
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,800
Last few years,
I started thinking that way,

349
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,100
And, uh, it started
sort of weighing on me.

350
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,700
Of course,
that was before...

351
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,700
A little while ago,
I had this --

352
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,600
It's called
a near-Death experience.

353
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,600
Very near.

354
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,400
And, uh...

355
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
...when came to...

356
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,800
Things were different.

357
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,400
My life's
been different.

358
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I realize
that I help people.

359
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Not just help them,
though. I save them.

360
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,000
I guess it's --
It's awesome.

361
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,000
It's kind of like
gift...

362
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,700
Like a mission.

363
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,300
Kind of like a...
a mission from god.

364
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,900
So, does that make you...

365
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,300
Some kind of monk
or something?

366
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,400
You know, celibate?

367
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,700
Man, I hope not.

368
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,700
Holy crap.
Oh, my god. Jamie.

369
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,652
Guys,
I'm -- I'm sorry.

370
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,952
I thought you guys
were going out.

371
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,652
Lucy,
it's -- It's okay.

372
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,152
-Uh, listen --
-You know what?

373
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,952
I just -- I came to
borrow a bottle.

374
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,000
I kind of got something
going back at my...

375
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,652
Anyway, uh,
you guys look really busy,

376
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,452
So I'm just gonna get out
of your hair.

377
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,352
Seriously, Lucy,
it's been a crazy night.

378
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,900
Stay for a drink.

379
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,800
Yeah. Stay for a drink.

380
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,400
Whoa!

381
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,952
You, fbi man --
What did I --

382
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,852
Shut up, okay,
you know what you did.

383
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,452
What?

384
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,452
I know what you are.

385
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,100
I'm not anything.
I just like to play the casio.

386
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,452
Had time to grow
the ear back, huh?

387
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,400
What?!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

388
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,952
It's supposed to come off.

389
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,900
No, it's not!

390
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,152
Oh, that sounds awful.
Jamie, honey, are you okay?

391
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,600
Oh, I am fine.

392
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,452
He didn't even touch me.

393
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,952
Dean, he just blew right in
and fought him off.

394
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,852
Well,
I didn't actually fly,

395
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,652
But I'm sure it seemed
that way at the time.

396
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,000
It was really,
really something.

397
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Jamie

398
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,400
So, Dean, are you like
a black belt or what?

399
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,900
Well,I guess they train you to fight
at the academy or whatever.

400
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,800
Dean,
what are you doing?

401
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,500
It's you,
isn't it?

402
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,100
Oh, damn it!

403
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,700
What did you put
in the drinks?!

404
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,700
That's all right.
I'll skin you myself.

405
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,500
And...scene.

406
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
Oh, come on.

407
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,252
She is beautiful,

408
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
No?

409
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,500
Bride number three
from the first film.

410
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,600
She never got the acclaim
that she deserved.

411
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,452
Which is why
I chose her shape,

412
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,800
Her form to move
among the mortals unnoticed,

413
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,100
To listen to the cricket songs
of the living.

414
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,400
That is when I discovered
my bride had been reborn

415
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,800
In this century.

416
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,652
I can't get over
what a pumpkin-Pie-Eyed,

417
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,100
Crazy son of a bitch
you really are.

418
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,600
You're not dracula.

419
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,800
You get that, right?

420
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,952
Or even if you think
you are dracula,

421
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,900
What the hell's up
with the mummy?!

422
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,352
I am all monsters!

423
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,700
Life ain't a movie,
you sorry sack of --

424
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,170
Aah.

425
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,160
Life is small.

426
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,610
Meager messy

427
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,900
The movies are grand,simple,elegant.

428
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,230
I have chosen elegance.

429
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,750
You think "elegance" is really the word

430
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,610
For what you did to Marissa or Rick Deacon

431
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,400
Or any of the others?!

432
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,500
But of course.

433
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,470
It is a monster movie,after all.

434
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,842
You do realize what happens

435
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,520
At the end of every monster movie?

436
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:45,960
Ah. But this movie is mine.

437
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,360
And in it,the monster wins.

438
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,690
The monster gets the girl.

439
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,490
And the hero,he's...electrocuted.

440
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,620
And tonight,jonathan Harker,

441
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,160
You will be my hero.

442
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,650
Wait,wait,wait,wait.

443
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,570
Please,excuse me.

444
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,590
Good evening.

445
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,000
Uh...pizza delivery.

446
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,360
Ah,you've brought a repast.

447
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,710
Excellent.

448
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,350
Continue to be of such service

449
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,760
And your life will be spared.

450
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,660
Uh-Huh.

451
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,070
That'll be $15.50.

452
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,250
Tell me... yeah?

453
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,530
...is there garlic on this pizza?

454
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,002
I don't know. Did you order garlic?

455
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:29,790
No!

456
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,410
Then no.

457
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,110
Look,mister,I got four other deliveries to make.

458
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,100
You want to just pay me e money so I can go?

459
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,250
Yes. C

460
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,500
But I have a coupon.

461
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,360
Dean,hey,listen,uh,Ed is not our guy.

462
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,582
Um,I'm guessing you're at home with Jamie,

463
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,770
So just give me a call,okay?

464
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,100
Lucy.

465
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,090
You wake.

466
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,610
The gown -- It suits your beauty.

467
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,920
Please,put it on.

468
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,430
Where am I?

469
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,060
What have you done with Dean?

470
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,310
Harker is resting elsewhere.

471
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,500
Please,put on the gown and you may dine.

472
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,470
We are having pizza.

473
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,280
What?

474
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,670
What is wrong with you?

475
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,760
You made up Lucy,right? Pretended to be my friend.

476
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,062
I needed to know if you were the one.

477
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,590
You could try talking to people!

478
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,720
But instead you become this?

479
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,060
the gown.

480
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,972
I don't want to play your stupid game,okay?

481
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,080
I just --I just want to go home.

482
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,770
Put on the gown!

483
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,220
I scared you.

484
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,340
You were the only one I don't want to scare.

485
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,670
I used to love the movies.

486
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,630
They aren't real.

487
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,350
You can't make them real.

488
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,430
"Real" is being born this way.

489
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,220
Different.

490
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,090
"Real" is having your dad call you "monster" --

491
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,970
It's the first time you hear the word --

492
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,080
And he tries to beat you to death with a shovel.

493
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,530
Everywhere I ran,everywhere I tried to hide,

494
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,570
People found me,n dagged me

495
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,570
Called me "freak," called me "monster."

496
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,570
Then I found them.

497
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,750
The great monsters.

498
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,720
In their movies,they were strong.

499
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,910
They were feared.

500
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,540
They were beautiful.

501
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,760
And now I am like them.

502
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,030
Commanding.

503
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,220
terrifying.

504
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,470
Lonely.

505
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,240
was lonely.

506
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,600
Now I --

507
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,970
I have you.

508
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,262
Ever think that maybe you're lonely

509
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,820
Because you kill people?

510
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,110
Or I kill people because I'm lonely.

511
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:19,830
Did you hear that?

512
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,380
What?

513
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,080
Dean?

514
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,050
Dean!

515
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,430
Oh,thank god. Just in the nick of time.

516
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,410
That guy was about to frankenstein me.

517
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,722
Hey there,handsome.

518
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,470
Shut up!

519
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:13,820
Let's go.

520
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,630
Aah!

521
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,220
[ Hungarian accent ] you will never be van helsing!

522
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,370
And you,Harker,now you die.

523
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,400
How 'bout now you shut the hell up?

524
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,590
Silver?

525
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,200
It was beauty that killed the beast.

526
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,480
No,Mina,do not weep.

527
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,280
Perhaps this is how

528
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,220
The movie should end.

529
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,540
Well,thank you,g-Man.

530
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,022
You have been a great service to your co

531
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,220
Oh,yes,I'm very,very patriotic.

532
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:18,890
Bye.

533
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,300
Bye.

534
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,510
You guys saved my life,you know?

535
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,680
So,thanks.

536
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,190
I like her.

537
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,990
Feels good to be back on the job,doesn't it?

538
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,510
Yeah,it does.

539
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,922
The hero gets the girl,

540
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,070
Monster gets the gts all in all,happy ending --

541
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,440
With a happy ending,no less.

542
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,440
[ Chuckles ] real classy,Dean.

543
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,980
Hey,all I'm saying is

544
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,150
The shifter man had a point,you know?

545
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,820
It would be nice if life was movie simple.

546
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,642
Although,if I was turning life into a movie,

547
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,430
I wouldn't do this "abbott and costello meet the monster" crap.

548
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,960
Yeah. No,I know what you'd pick.

549
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,250

550
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,980

551
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,220
No,you don't.

552
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,380
You don't. "Porky's ii."

553
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,010
What? You heard me.

554
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,110
