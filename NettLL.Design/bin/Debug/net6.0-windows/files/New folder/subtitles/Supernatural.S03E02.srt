00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,730

of bitches and we raise a little hell?

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,260

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,460

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,090
you're offering up your own soul?

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,660
all you got to do is bring sam back.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,430
i'll give you one year and one year only.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,960
i couldn't let him die,bobby. he's my brother.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,660
i could throttle you!

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,190
i don't care what it takes. 
i'm gonna get you out of this.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,660
if we trap the crossroads demon

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,290
try to welsh our way out of the 
deal in any way,you die.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,860
what kind of blade can kill a demon?

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,860
yesterday,i would have said 
there was no such thing.

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,430

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,930

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,690
i'm the girl that just saved your ass.

19
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,330
thanks for driving her back here.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,560
it's not like i had a choice.

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,230
she pitched a fit.

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,060

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,790

27
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,330
i don't want dad to have a night anymore.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,060
since when?

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,160
you used to love going to your dad's house.

30
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,760
you know,he loves you, and he misses you a lot.

31
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,830
but i hate it there!

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,890

33
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,060

34
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,660
he's mean, and there are monsters there.

35
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,830
i don't w-want to go back.

36
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,530
please don't let the monsters get me.

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,830

supernatural season 3 episode 2

40
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,730
what do you mean you don't 
think it will work,bobby?

41
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,030
it's a demon-dispelling ritual.

42
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,360
well,maybe we got the translation wrong.

43
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,190
look,we can't just let dean fry in hell while we 

44
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,390
there's got to be something

45
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,730
yeah. no. i got to go.

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,730

47
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,230
hey. who was that?

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,460
i was just ordering pizza.

49
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,860
dude,you do realize that 
you're in a restaurant?

50
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,190
yeah. yeah. oh,yeah.

51
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,160

52
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,430
okay,weirdy mcweirderton.

53
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,830
so,i think i got something.

54
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,230

55
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,530

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,230

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,590
well...yeah.

61
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,830
well,i don't know.could be.

62
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,390
i don't know,dean.

63
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,760
there's something better in 
cicero than just a case.

64
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,860
and that is?

65
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,960
lisa braeden.

66
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,830

lisa braeden's loft.

73
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,260
so let me get this straight.

74
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,130
you want to drive all the way to cicero

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,960
just to hook up with some random chick?

76
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,760
she was a yoga teacher.

77
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,530

138
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,160

139
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,530

i'm worried about katie.

150
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,190
i think there might be something...wrong with her.

151
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,490
of course there is.

152
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,890
the poor girl just lost her dad.

153
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,930
she's devastated.

154
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,560
no. that's not what i'm talking about.

155
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,090
there is something really...

156
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,690
wrong with her.

157
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,190
i'm not sure that katie is...katie.

158
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,930
what?

159
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,890
i'm not sure that's my daughter.

160
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,430
i know you're grieving,but you can't talk like that.

161
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,490
katie needs you.but you don't understand --

162
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,460

163
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,860

164
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,830

174
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,430

175
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,760

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,030
that knife you had 

196
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,130
you can kill demons with that thing?

197
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,860
sure comes in handy when i have to swoop in

198
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,260
and save the damsel in distress.

199
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
where did you get it?skymall.

1
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,930
Why are you following me?

2
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,260
I'm interested in you.

3
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,630
why?

4
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,860
because you're tall...

5
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,360
and i love a tall man.

6
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,030
and then there's the whole antichrist thing.

7
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,660
excuse me?

8
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,930
generation of psychic kids,yellow-eyed 
demon rounds you up,

9
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,460
celebrity death match ensues.

10
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,490
you're the sole survivor.

11
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,660
how do you know about that?

12
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,160
i'm a good hunter.

13
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,130
so,yellow eyes had some pretty 
big plans for you,sam.

14
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,530
"had" being the key word.

15
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,260
oh,yeah,yeah,yeah.that's right.

16
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,030
ding-dong, the demon's dead.

17
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,790
good job with that.

18
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,590
it doesn't change the fact that you're special...

19
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,360
and that anthony michael hall 
e.s.p. visions come into play.

20
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,660
no. that's stuff's not happening anymore...

21
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,160
not since yellow eyes died.

22
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,730
well,i'm thinking you're still a pretty big deal.

23
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,390
i mean,after all that business with your mom.

24
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,630
what about my mom?

25
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,960
you know, what happened to her friends.

26
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,630
you...don't know.

27
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,560
you've got a little bit of catching up to do,my friend.

28
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:18,160
so,why don't you look into your mom's pals

29
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,190
and then give me a call and we'll talk again?

30
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,460
and,by the way,

31
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,260
you do know there's a job in this town,right?

32
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,130
hello.

33
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,330
dude,there is a job here.

34
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,260

35
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,260
yeah. you know that one freak accident

36
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,590
we read about in the paper?

37
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,030
there's four more that never 
even made the paper,

38
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,130
all in this morning hill gated community.

39
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,730
people falling off of ladders and 
drowning in their jacuzzis

40
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,860
all over the neighborhood.

41
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,760
-that is weird.  -yeah,something's up...

42
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,190
something these nice,
big gates can't protect them from.

43
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,790
katie.

44
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,330
what are you doing?

45
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,590
play with me,mommy.

46
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,430
okay.

47
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
sure. yeah let's,um,let's play.

48
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,060
oh,good.

49
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,130
i love you,mommy.

50
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,590
i love you too,sweetie.

51
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,590
i'm hungry,mommy.

52
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,360
yeah.

53
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,960
yeah.

54
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,790
so,once again, i'm very sorry to disturb you.

55
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,430
we just really want to expedite 
that life-insurance policy.

56
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,590
-of course.  -okay.

57
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,030
this is,um,where he fell.

58
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,090
i see.

59
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,590
now,how exactly did he --

60
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,990
he was just inside changing a light bulb.

61
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,590
must have lost his balance.

62
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,530
-were you here when this happened? 
 -no. i was out.

63
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,990
uh,the only one here was our daughter,dakota.

64
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,830
okay.

65
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,260
okay. well,uh,i think that's all i need.

66
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,860
i'll get out of your way now.

67
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,430
thank you.

68
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,260
thank you,mommy.

69
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,160
you eat.

70
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,690
mommy will be right back.

71
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,630
mommy?

72
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,960
just --  just give mommy a second.

73
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,060
let me in.

74
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,890
mommy.

75
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,290
let me in.

76
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,060

77
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,590

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,590
let me in!

82
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,390
give mommy a minute.

83
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,590
aren't you just the cutest thing?

84
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,760
oh,thank you.

85
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,090
uh,katie,could you put 
these in the kitchen,please?

86
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,060
katie seems okay, considering 

87
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,530
she's fine. yeah.um,look,i'm 

88
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,390
and you -- how are you doing really?

89
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,960
i'm fine. look,we're fine.

90
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,590
um,this isn't a good time 

91
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,260
i wasn't sure if you were 
keeping the house or selling.

92
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,760
we at cicero realty would like 

93
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,790
look,i told you it's not a good time!

94
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,290
i want ice cream.

95
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,330
mommy,ice cream,please.

96
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,490
hey,ben.

97
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,890
hey.  you were at my party.

98
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,790
yeah. yeah,i'm dean.

99
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,690
everything okay? something wrong?

100
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,490
is that your game they're playing with?

300
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,030
ryan humphrey borrowed it, 
and now he won't give it back.

301
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,360
-well,you want me to go... 
-no! don't go over there!

302
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,160
only bitches send a grown-up.

303
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,830
you're not wrong.

304
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,490
and i'm not a bitch.

305
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,160
is that humphrey?

306
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,890
the one that needs to lay off the burgers?

308
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,060
ryan.

309
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,560
i'd like my game back, please.

310
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,990
fine. take it back.

311
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,890
see? told you guys he was a

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,850
thanks

312
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,960
dude,that was awesome!

313
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,990
benjamin isaac braeden... what's gotten into you?

314
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,190
he stole my game.

315
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,030
so you kick him? since when is...

316
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,290
did you tell my son to beat up that kid?

317
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,960
what? somebody had to teach him 
how to kick the bully in the nads

318
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,460
-who asked you to teach him anything?
-just relax.

319
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,860
what are you even still doing here?

320
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,330
we had one weekend 
together a million years ago.

321
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,090
you don't know me. you have 
no business with my son.

322
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,290
lisa.

323
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,130
just leave us alone.

324
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,630
ben!

325
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,130
thanks.

326
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,330
i love you most in the 
whole wide world,mommy.

327
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,860
um,me,too,sweetie.

328
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,660
come on,hold still.

329
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,030
what's wrong,mommy?

330
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,860
nothing,sweetie.

331
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,330
are we going for ice cream now?

332
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,990
yeah, we're going for ice cream.

334
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,660
can i have the ice cream now?

335
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,030
kids in this town.

336
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,530
yeah. tell me about it.

337
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,330
so,what do you know about changelings?

338
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,490
evil monster babies?

339
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,590
no,not necessarily babies.

340
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,660
they're kids...

341
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,890
creepy,"stare at you like you're lunch" kids.

342
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,960
yeah.

343
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,890
there's one at every victim's house.

344
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,060
so,changelings can perfectly mimic children.

345
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,360
according to lore,they climb in 
the window,snatch the kid.

346
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,890
there were marks on the windowsill

347
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,090
at one of the kid's houses.

348
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,330
looked to me like blood.

349
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,260
the changeling grabs a kid, 
assumes its form,

350
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,530
joins the happy fam just for kicks?

351
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,760
not quite.

352
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,790
changelings feed on the mom...

353
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,960
synovial fluid.

354
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,730
the moms have these odd bruises on the back of their necks.

355
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,700
changelings can drain them for a few weeks

356
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,990
before mom finally croaks.

357
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,260
and then there's dad and the babysitter 

358
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,790
yeah. seems like anyone who gets 
between the changeling's food source ends up dead.

360
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,630
and fire's the only way to waste them?

361
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,460
great. we'll just bust in, drag the kids out,

362
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,560
torch them on the front lawn.

363
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,590
that will play great with the neighbors.

364
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,290
what about the real ones? 
what happens to them?

365
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,930
they stash them underground somewhere.

366
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,730
i don't know why, but if it's true,

367
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,460
the real kids might be out there.

368
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,330
we better start looking.

369
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,030
so,any kid in the neighborhood is vulnerable?

370
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,930
-yep. -we got to make a stop.

371
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,290
i want to check on someone.

372
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,790
if the real kids are still alive,
we don't have time

373
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,460
we have to.

374
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,960
dean 

375
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,260
i was thinking... ben's birthday.

376
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,330
i didn't bring him a present.

377
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,590
that's okay.

378
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,660
no. no. no. i feel terrible,so,uh...

379
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,690
here.

380
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,460
take a long weekend --

381
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,890
just the two of you -- on me.

382
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,090
what?

1
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,290
I hear six flags is great this time of year.

2
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,660
Go now. avoid the traffic.

3
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,330
"Siegfried Houdini."

4
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,430
Whose card is this?

5
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Mine.

6
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,660
Never mind. it'll work.

7
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,660
I promise.

8
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,060
You should leave.

9
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,960
Lisa...

10
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,660
Mommy,what's wrong?

11
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,490
Nothing,Ben. It's cool.

12
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,830
Make him go away,mommy.

13
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,490
You heard him.

14
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,630
Get out.

15
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,890
Lisa...

16
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,460
I don't think this is a good idea.

17
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,160
Get out!

18
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
They took ben he's changed.

19
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,790
What?! Are you sure?

20
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,890
Yeah,i'm sure. I checked his windowsill.

21
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,960
Blood?

22
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,360
I don't think it is blood,

23
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,460
And i think i know where the kids are.

24
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,130
Red dirt.

25
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,960
That's what was on the window.

26
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,130
You take the front.

27
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,090
I'll go around.

28
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,730
ben..ben...it's okay.

29
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,160
I'm gonna get you out of here.

30
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,360
What do you think you're doing?

31
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,830
This is private property.

32
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,260
I'm calling the police.

33
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,090
You heard me! Get out!

34
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,730
Let me get my bag. I'm going.

35
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,060
I don't mean to cause any trouble.

36
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,590
Mommy?

37
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,630
ben.. Play with me.

38
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,990
This isn't funny anymore. 
I put you to bed three times.

39
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:15,160
I don't want to go to bed.

40
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,590
I want to be with you,mommy.

41
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,730
That's sweet,hon.

42
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,760
Come on.

43
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,930
Let's go.

44
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,590
All right,come on.

45
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,860
I'm hungry.

46
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,230
Mini pizzas okay?

47
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,660
Deluxe is all we've got.

48
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,930
Okay.

49
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,290
That's funny -- 
I thought we were anti-olives this month.

50
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,200
it's ok. get out here ok?

50
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,960
Come on,girls! Come on!

51
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,330
Everybody back! Everybody back!

52
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,330
Cover your eyes!

53
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,230
Here. Use this.

54
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
All right.

55
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,860
All right,ben. Come on.

56
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,890
Him first.

57
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,130
Hey! Dean! There's a mother.

58
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,190
A mother changeling?

59
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,830
We got to get these kids out quick.

60
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,730
Right there. There's one more.

61
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,690
You got to break the lock!

62
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,260
I guess that's why the changelings

63
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,830
are keeping the kids alive 
--so the mom can snack on them.

65
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,330
What's wrong,mommy?

66
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,860
You're not my son.

67
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,560
Yes,i am. Where's ben?

68
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,430
I'm ben.

69
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,690
I love you,mommy.

70
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,660
They don't want you to leave me,mommy.

71
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,060
Mommy? Mommy?

72
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,060
Let me in!

73
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,760
What are you doing?!

74
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,330
Let me in!

75
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,230
Let me in! Let me in! let me in!

76
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,090
ben,get them out of here!

461
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,190
ben?!

462
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,290
ben!

463
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,260
baby,are you okay?

464
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,760
i'm okay,mom.

465
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,760
oh,my god.

466
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,160
what the hell just happened?

467
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,260
i'll explain everything if you want me to,

468
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,030
but,trust me, you probably don't.

469
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,490
the important thing is that ben's safe.

470
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,260
thank you.

471
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,030
thank you.

472
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,160
i'm gonna give you guys some time.

473
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,630
come on.

474
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,790
changelings?

475
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,060
you know how i never mentioned my job?

476
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,660
this is my job.

477
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,730
i so didn't want to know that.

478
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,660
do you think he'll be okay?

479
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,790
yeah. i think he'll be fine.

480
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,960
okay. seriously...

481
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,890
i mean,you're 100% 
sure that he is not mine,right?

482
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,030
you're off the hook.

483
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,830
i did a blood test when he was a baby.

485
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,990
there was this guy some 
bar back in a biker joint.

486
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,390
what? i had a type.

487
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,530
leather jacket,couple of scars,
no mailing address

488
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
i was there.

489
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,190
guess i was a little wild back then...

490
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,690
...before i became a mom.

491
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,860
so,yeah. you can relax.

492
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,430
good.

493
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,130
i...

494
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,960
i swear you look disappointed.

495
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,890
yeah,i don't know.

496
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,390
it's weird,you know your life.

497
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,790
i mean,this house and kid.

498
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,130
it's not my life...

499
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,130
never will be.

500
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,860
some stuff happened to me recently,and,uh...

501
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,990
anyway,a guy in my situation --

502
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,430
you start to think, you know.

503
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,830
i'm gonna be gone one day,

504
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,330
and what am i leaving behind besides a car?

505
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,690
i don't know.

506
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,160
ben may not be your kid,

507
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,930
but he wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.

508
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,160
that's a lot if you ask me.

509
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,960
you know, just for the record...

510
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,390
you got a great kid.

511
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,390
i would have been proud to be his dad.

512
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,260
look,if,um...

513
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,330
if you want to stick around for a while...

514
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,290
you're welcome to stay.

515
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,030
i can't.

516
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,090
i got a lot of work to do, and it's not my life.

517
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,560

some facts with your,uh...

00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,030
wasn't he a cardiac surgeon?

531
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,760

532
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,290

00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,690
they're dead all of them.

540
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,730
all of my mom's friends.

541
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
her doctor,her uncle --

542
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,330
everyone who ever knew her

543
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,290
systematically wiped off 
the map one at a time.

544
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,830
someone went through 
a hell of a lot of trouble

545
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,760
trying to cover their tracks.

547
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,430
the yellow-eyed demon.

548
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,860
so,what's your deal?

549
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,390

00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,530
you know all about me. 
you know all about my mom.

551
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,360
i already told you. i'm 

552
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,760
oh,right,right. yeah. just a hunter.

553
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,990
just some hunter

554
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,230
who happens to know more about 
my own family than i do.

555
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,830
just tell me who you are.

556
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,260

557
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,630

00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,260
just tell me who you are!

560
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,730
fine.

561
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,890
think twice before going for that holy water.

562
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,130
give me one reason i should.

563
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,290
i'm here to help you,sam.

564
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,430
is this some kind of joke?

565
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,430
god's honest truth...

566
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,630

587
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,260
not all demons are the same,sam.

588
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,060
not all of us want the same thing.

589
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,530
me? 
i want to help you from time to time.

590
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,660
that's all.

591
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,130
and if you let me, 
there's something in it for you.

592
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,730
what could you possibly

593
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,890
i could help you save your brother.
