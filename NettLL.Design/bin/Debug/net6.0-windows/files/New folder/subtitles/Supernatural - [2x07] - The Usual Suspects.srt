1
00:00:00,077 --> 00:00:01,567
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off --

2
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:03,467
Saving people,
hunting things.

3
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,634
The family business.

4
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:08,567
You still running
credit-Card scams?

5
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,034
You think credit-Card fraud
is easy?

6
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:11,534
Okay, mr. Burkowitz.

7
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,400
Federal marshals.
Environmental study majors.

8
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:15,267
I'm father simmons.
U.S. Wildlife service.

9
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,101
Nigel tuffnel.
Dr. Jerry kaplan.

10
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:18,101
Reporters.

11
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,734
Rangers.
Fraternity brothers.

12
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:22,034
Homeland security?
Pretty illegal, even for us.

13
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:24,868
Man: s.W.A.T. Team discovered
a local woman bound and gagged.

14
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,101
Her attacker, a white male

15
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:28,886
Approximately 24
to 30 years of age,

16
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:30,753
Was discovered hiding
in the home.

17
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:31,649
Shapeshifter?

18
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,451
Every culture has
a shapeshifter lore --

19
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,616
Legends of creatures
who can transform themselves

20
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,483
Into animals or other men.

21
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:39,917
Hey!

22
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:45,050
Cops are blaming
this dean winchester guy

23
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:46,483
For emily's murder.

24
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,159
Sorry i'm gonna miss it.
???

25
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,475
How many chances am i gonna have
to see my own funeral?

26
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:55,476
Supernatural 207

27
00:00:55,493 --> 00:01:00,493
<Font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.Com present</font>

28
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,417
Under what name?

29
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:07,950
Oh, yeah,
that's my favorite so far.

30
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,384
Possible i.D.S in three states
that we know of.

31
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:15,650
I got to call you back.

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,050
First i thought you were
just stepping up your game.

33
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:33,184
Credit-Card fraud,
breaking and entering.

34
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:37,778
This one, a puzzle --
Grave desecration.

35
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:41,850
But still, these are
a long way from murder.

36
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,184
Then we get a fax
from st. Louis...

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,284
...where you're suspected
of torturing and murdering

38
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,217
A young woman.

39
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,166
However, no one could
prove anything, of course,

40
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,717
Because supposedly
you died there.

41
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,583
But i got to
tell you something.

42
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,150
You look pretty healthy
to me.

43
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:09,850
So, now we know
karen giles

44
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,017
Wasn't the first person
you murdered.

45
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,217
Going somewhere, sam?

46
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:19,017
But i guarantee you
she's the last.

47
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:27,227
<Font color="#ffff00">capture:frm@donale
sync:frm@linda</font>

48
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,384
Thought you might
be thirsty.

49
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:45,284
Okay,
so you're the good cop.

50
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:46,616
Where's the bad cop?

51
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,750
He's with your brother.

52
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,917
Okay.
And you're holding us why?

53
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,850
He's being held
on suspicion of murder.

54
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:53,616
And you? We'll see.

55
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,850
Murder?

56
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,017
You sound
genuinely surprised.

57
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,583
Or are you that good
of an actor?

58
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:01,284
Who is he supposed to
have murdered?

59
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:02,082
We'll get around to that.

60
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,549
You can't hold us here
without formal charges.

61
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,550
Actually,
we can for 48 hours.

62
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,384
You, being a prelaw student,
would know that.

63
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,616
I know all about you,
sam.

64
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,317
You're 23 years old.

65
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:17,783
No job, no home address.

66
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:20,384
Your mother died
when you were a baby.

67
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:23,217
Your father's whereabouts
are unknown.

68
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,883
And then there's the case
of your brother, dean,

69
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,583
Whose demise was, well,
just a little bit exaggerated.

70
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,650
Feel free to jump in
whenever you like.

71
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:37,550
Shy? No problem.
I'll keep going.

72
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,050
Your family moved around a lot
when you were a kid.

73
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:42,817
Despite that, you were
a straight-A student.

74
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,516
Got into stanford
th a full ride.

75
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,850
Then about a year ago,

76
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,750
Therwas a fire
in your apartment.

77
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:55,850
One fatality -- Jessica moore,
your girlfriend.

78
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,683
After she died,
you fell off the grid,

79
00:03:58,717 --> 00:04:00,483
Left behind everything.

80
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:03,483
I needed some time off...

81
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,050
to deal.

82
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,717
So i'm taking a road trip
with my brother.

83
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,583
How's that going for you?

84
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,583
Great.

85
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,351
I mean...

86
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,417
we saw the second-Largest
ball of twine

87
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,683
In the continental u.S.

88
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,384
Awesome.

89
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:25,117
We ran dean's fingerprints
through iafis.

90
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,717
Got over a dozen
possible hits.

91
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,883
"Possible" hits,
which makes them worthless.

92
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,217
But makes you wonder,

93
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,783
What are we gonna find
when we run your prints?

94
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,050
Yeah, well, uh...

95
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,683
you be sure to let me know,
all right?

96
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:41,117
May i?

97
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,550
Please.
Great.

98
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:51,117
Sam, you seem like
a good kid.

99
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,483
It's not your fault
dean's your brother.

100
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:54,984
We can't pick our family.

101
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,216
Right now detectives
in st. Louis

102
00:04:58,217 --> 00:04:59,516
Are exhuming a corpse.

103
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,049
They're trying
to figure out

104
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,583
How your brother
faked his own death

105
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,417
After torturing
all those young women.

106
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:07,050
Dean's a bad guy.

107
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:09,217
His life is over.

108
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,717
Yours doesn't have to be.

109
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:15,483
You want me to turn against
my own brother?

110
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,850
No.

111
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,950
We already caught him cold,

112
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:21,883
Red-Handed at
the karen giles murder scene.

113
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:28,217
We just need you to fill in
some missing pieces.

114
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,117
Why would i do that?

115
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,850
Because i can talk
to the d.A.,

116
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:37,650
Make a deal for you.

117
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:40,084
You can get on
with your life.

118
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:41,783
Dean's as good as gone.

119
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,550
My dad and tony giles
were old friends.

120
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,817
They were in the service
together.

121
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,650
We've known him
since we were kids, you know?

122
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:01,550
So we came as soon
as we heard about his death.

123
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:07,917
Here you go.

124
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,184
Anthony giles.

125
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:10,950
Who's anthony giles?

126
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,950
The baltimore lawyer.

127
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:14,783
Working late in his office.
Check it out.

128
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:20,250
His throat was slit
but the room was clean.

129
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:22,883
Huh.
No dna, no prints.

130
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,650
Keep reading.
It gets better.

131
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,850
"Security cameras failed
to capture footage

132
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:28,483
Of the assailant."

133
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:30,550
Either somebody tampered
with the tapes...

134
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,250
or it's an invisible killer.

135
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,384
My favorite kind.

136
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:35,250
What do you think,
scully?

137
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:37,217
I'm not scully.
You're scully.

138
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,417
No, i'm mulder.
You're a redheaded woman.

139
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:43,150
So [chuckles]

140
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:45,184
It would've been hard
for an to kill tony,

141
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:47,184
Considering we weren't in town
at the time.

142
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:48,717
So, tell me
what happened next.

143
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,683
Okay, uh, that's when
we went to see karen.

144
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:55,150
She was barely
holding it together.

145
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,717
We just wanted to be there
for her, you know?

146
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:01,917
Insurance.

147
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,351
I totally forgot
about the insurance.

148
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,650
We're very sorry
to bother you right now,

149
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:09,717
But the company
is required

150
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,950
To conduct
its own investigation.

151
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:13,550
Sure.

152
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,817
Well, if you could just tell us
anything you remember

153
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,550
About the night
your husband died.

154
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,184
Tony and i were supposed to
have dinner.

155
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:24,250
He called and said that he was
having computer troubles

156
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:25,750
And that he had to work late.

157
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:28,817
That was it.

158
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,417
Do you have any idea
who could've done this to him?

159
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,984
No. No.

160
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,417
It's like i told the police.

161
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:38,550
I -- I have no idea.

162
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,817
Did tony mention
anything unusual to you

163
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,050
In the days
before his death?

164
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:46,817
Unusual?

165
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,917
Yeah, like strange.

166
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:51,817
Strange?

167
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,117
You know, karen, weird.

168
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,250
Weird noises, visions,
anything like that?

169
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,950
He had a nightmare
the day before he died.

170
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,417
What kind of a nightmare?

171
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:12,950
Uh, he said that he woke up
in the middle of the night,

172
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:15,917
And there was a woman
standing at the foot of the bed.

173
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,783
He blinked.
She was gone.

174
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,250
I mean,
it was just a nightmare.

175
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:21,984
Did he say
what she looked like?

176
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:26,483
What difference does it make
what she looked like?

177
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,583
Uh, it's just our company
is very thorough.

178
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:37,850
He said she was pale,
and she had dark, red eyes.

179
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:41,050
So i gave karen a hug,

180
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,017
Told her to call me
if she needed anything,

181
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,117
And that was it.

182
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,050
End of story.

183
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:50,850
Sam, i am trying
to help you here,

184
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:54,150
But you have got to
be honest with me.

185
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:56,650
Now,
we have an eyewitness,

186
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:59,117
Someone who saw two men

187
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,250
Fitting your
and your brother's description

188
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:03,284
Breaking
into giles' office.

189
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:05,084
Karen called us later.

190
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:07,082
There was some stuff she wanted
from tony's office,

191
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,349
But the police
weren't letting her in.

192
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,283
Like a picture
of the two of them in paris

193
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,684
And some other stuff.

194
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,450
It was wrong to enter
a crime scene,

195
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,483
But she gave us the key.

196
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,951
Hey.

197
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:33,984
Anthony giles' body was found
right about here.

198
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:35,917
"Throat slit so deep,

199
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,350
Part of his spinal cord
was visible."

200
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,984
What do you think?
Vengeful spirit?

201
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:43,483
Underline "vengeful"?

202
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,984
Maybe.

203
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,250
He did see that woman
at the foot of his bed.

204
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:53,286
Look at this.

205
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:57,684
"Dana shulps."

206
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:59,984
What's that, a name?

207
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,750
I don't know,
but it's everywhere.

208
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:09,796
"All work and no play
makes jack a dull boy."

209
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:33,550
I'd say we've officially
crossed over into weird.

210
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,017
Maybe giles knew her.

211
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,650
Maybe it's the name
of our pale,

212
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:37,750
Red-Eyed mystery girl.

213
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,517
Well...

214
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,617
let's see what we can see.

215
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:49,750
There's not a single mention
of a dana shulps anywhere.

216
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:53,062
There's not a d. Shulpsor any ot

217
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:54,129
Great.

218
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:55,695
What do you got?
???

219
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:58,829
No dana shulps has ever lived
or died in baltimore

220
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:00,361
In the last 50 years
at least.

221
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:01,695
So, what now?

222
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,328
I think i'm pretty close
to cracking giles' password.

223
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:06,162
Maybe there's something
in his fil.

224
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:07,762
By "close" you mean...

225
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:08,995
30 minutes maybe.

226
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:13,062
Awesome.

227
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:18,157
So, i guess i just get to,
uh, hang out.

228
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,036
That's awesome.

229
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,597
Dude, seriously.

230
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:36,862
I'm gonna go talk
to karen again,

231
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,328
See if she knows anything
about this dana shulps, huh?

232
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,461
Great.

233
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:43,296
Keep going, sparky.

234
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,628
Then dean went back
to karen's place

235
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:47,029
To check up on her.

236
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,395
I mean, you know,

237
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,162
She had been
pretty upset earlier.

238
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:51,428
Why didn't you go
with him?

239
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:55,728
I just went back
to the motel.

240
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,829
How did you know i was there,
by the way?

241
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:00,876
We found the motel matchbook
on your brother

242
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:02,528
When we arrested him.

243
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:06,262
Let's quit fooling around.

244
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:07,395
You were with your brother

245
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,095
The whole time
you were in baltimore.

246
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,562
Why separate now?

247
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:14,257
Because your brother left you
to go murder karen.

248
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:15,677
He didn't kill anyone.

249
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:17,829
I heard the 911 call!

250
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,695
Karen was terrified!

251
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:21,628
She said someone
was in the house.

252
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:32,542
Woman:
emergency services.

253
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,495
Hello?

254
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,296
I think i saw somebody
in my house.

255
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,795
What is your address,
ma'am?

256
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,515
It's 421 clinton avenue.
Please --

257
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:42,962
Hello?

258
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,909
Karen, you in there?

259
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,743
Oh, god.

260
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:47,243
Seriously, what the hell?

261
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:07,476
Freeze.
Stay on your knees.

262
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,676
Hands where
i can see them.

263
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,510
Now!

264
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,109
Cuff him.

265
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,309
You getting anywhere
with him?

266
00:16:28,343 --> 00:16:31,843
No. Just a lot
of wiseass remarks.

267
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:33,242
You?

268
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,643
Sam's story matches dean's
to the last detail.

269
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:39,409
Yeah, well,
these guys are good.

270
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:41,676
I'll give them that.

271
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,552
If we don't get sam
to flip,

272
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,609
We have nothing but a lot
of circumstantial evidence.

273
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:50,277
We got dean at the crime scene
with blood on his hands.

274
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,676
Juries have convicted
for less.

275
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:56,210
Yeah, but, i mean,
where is the murder weapon?

276
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:57,691
What's the motive?

277
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:59,422
You talk about
reasonable doubt.

278
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:00,876
Diana...

279
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,709
do you have
reasonable doubt?

280
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:11,971
We keep leaning on these guys,
one of them will tumble.

281
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:13,628
And don't forget about
st. Louis.

282
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:18,743
I'm telling you,
this dean guy is our guy.

283
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,623
I know tony giles
was a friend of yours.

284
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,556
Yeah, he was.
He was a good friend.

285
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,256
I know you want to clean
this mess up quick,

286
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:27,423
But come on.

287
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:29,490
Tony knew a lot
of criminal types.

288
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:30,790
Maybe we just --

289
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:32,590
"Criminal types"?

290
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:34,590
He was a defense lawyer,
for god sakes.

291
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:37,323
Of course he knew
criminal types.

292
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,223
Okay. All right.
Let's get back at them.

293
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:41,623
No. You know what?

294
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:45,123
Let them stew in their juices
for a bit.

295
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:51,889
Come here.

296
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,757
Dana shulps, dana shulps,

297
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,623
Dana shulps, dana --
Dana shulps.

298
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,790
Maybe it's not a name.

299
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:24,356
Maybe it's not a name.

300
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,289
Anagram maybe?

301
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,456
Mr. Winchester?

302
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,456
Yeah.

303
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,922
I'm jeff crouse.

304
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:51,456
I'm with the public
defender's office.

305
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,857
I'm your lawyer.

306
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:56,289
Oh, thank god.
I'm saved.

307
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,356
Can i, uh, steal a pen
from you and some paper?

308
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,989
Sure.

309
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:05,989
Well, the police haven't found
a weapon yet,

310
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:07,223
So that's good.

311
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:11,090
But, uh,
they got your prints

312
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:14,622
And literally blood
on your hands.

313
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:18,689
And with your police record,
uh...

314
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,090
mr. Winchester,
what are you doing?

315
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,956
I think it's an anagram.

316
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,490
A what?
An anagram.

317
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:28,190
Same letters,
different words.

318
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,023
Could you do me a favor?

319
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:34,156
See if you recognize any
of these words --

320
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,356
Local names, places,
anything like that.

321
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,156
Do you understand
how serious these charges are?

322
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:44,156
I'm handcuffed to a table.
Yeah. I get it.

323
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,390
Humor me.
Take a quick look.

324
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,856
Well, s-U-P?

325
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,722
I don't know about that,
but...

326
00:19:57,756 --> 00:20:00,323
ashland is a street name.

327
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:02,223
It's not far from here.

328
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,656
Street?

329
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,557
Let's start
with where you were

330
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,989
The night
that anthony giles died.

331
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:10,490
Can you get in
to see my brother?

332
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,789
Mr. Winchester...

333
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:15,223
you could be facing
the death penalty here.

334
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,090
Hey, thanks for the law review,
matlock.

335
00:20:18,123 --> 00:20:20,722
But if you want
to help me...

336
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,323
...i need you to see
my brother.

337
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,989
I hope that was meaningful.

338
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:13,622
But i'd like to discuss
your case now.

339
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,323
Sure thing, matlock.

340
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:18,956
You two really are brothers,
aren't you?

341
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:21,390
Now...

342
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:25,423
as you know, the d.A.
Might be interested in --

343
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:30,356
We need you
with the other one.

344
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:39,290
This should be nice.

345
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:44,889
Counselor...

346
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:47,889
your boy decided to confess.

347
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,589
Mr. Winchester,

348
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,589
I would advise against that
strongly.

349
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:53,589
Talk directly
into the camera.

350
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:55,589
Start by stating your name
for the record.

351
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:01,256
My name is dean winchester.

352
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,156
I'm an aquarius.

353
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,889
I enjoy sunsets,
long walks on the beach,

354
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:07,889
And frisky women.

355
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:11,423
And i did not kill anyone,
but i know who did --

356
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:13,589
Or rather what did.

357
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:15,390
Of course,
it can't be for sure

358
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:18,223
Because our investigation
was interrupted.

359
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:19,557
But our working theory

360
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,689
Is that we're looking for
some kind of vengeful spirit.

361
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:24,223
Excuse me?

362
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,023
You know,
casper the bloodthirsty ghost.

363
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:30,123
Tony giles saw it.

364
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:32,323
I'll bet you cash money
karen did, too.

365
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:34,823
See, the interesting thing
is the word it leaves behind.

366
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:35,823
For some reason,

367
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,989
It's trying
to tell us something.

368
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,889
But communicating
across a veil ain't easy.

369
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:45,390
And sometimes the spirits,
they get things jumbled.

370
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:47,056
You remember "redrum."

371
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,423
Same concept.

372
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:51,789
You know,
it could be word fragments.

373
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:54,423
Other times...

374
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:58,056
...it's anagrams.

375
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,923
At first we thought
this was a name --

376
00:22:59,956 --> 00:23:01,756
Dana shulps.

377
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,490
But now we think
it's a street --

378
00:23:04,523 --> 00:23:05,923
Ashland.

379
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:09,457
Whatever is going on,
i'm betting it started there.

380
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,290
You arrogant bastard.

381
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:14,023
Tony and karen
were good people,

382
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:15,256
And you're making jokes.

383
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,090
I'm not joking, ponch.

384
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:20,977
You murdered them
in cold blood

385
00:23:20,977 --> 00:23:22,989
Just like that girl
in st. Louis.

386
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,543
Oh, yeah, that wasn't me,
either.

387
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:27,645
That was a shapeshifter
that only looked like me.

388
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:32,511
Pete, that is enough!

389
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:36,077
You asked for the truth.

390
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,053
???

391
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,211
Pete:
what the hell?

392
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:56,700
?????

393
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,578
How did he do it?

394
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,910
The fire escape's
way over...

395
00:24:10,977 --> 00:24:12,444
what?

396
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:14,177
These two guys.

397
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:20,044
Hilts and mcqueen?
What is that?

398
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:22,810
Hilts is steve mcqueen's
character in "the great escape."

399
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:24,253
Can we make this quick?
I'm really tired.

400
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:25,260
It's been a long day,
you know,

401
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:27,028
With your partner
assaulting me and all.

402
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:29,228
I want to know more
about that stuff

403
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,794
You were talking
about earlier.

404
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:33,594
Time life,
"mysteries of the unknown."

405
00:25:33,627 --> 00:25:35,794
Look it up.

406
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:42,095
Let's pretend
for the moment

407
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:44,028
You're not entirely insane.

408
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:48,994
What would one of these things
be doing here?

409
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:50,261
Vengeful spirit?

410
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,028
Well, they're created
by violent deaths,

411
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:57,994
And then they come back
for a reason --

412
00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,627
Usually a nasty one,

413
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:02,462
Like revenge on the people
that hurt them.

414
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:05,661
And, uh, these spirits...

415
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:09,128
...they're capable
of killing people?

416
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:16,395
Where did you get that?

417
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,295
I don't know.

418
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:26,428
It wasn't there before.

419
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:29,961
You've seen it,
haven't you?

420
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:31,128
The spirit.

421
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:32,295
How did you know?

422
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:34,994
Karen had the same bruises
on her wrists.

423
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:37,562
I'm willing to bet that
if you look at giles' photos,

424
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:38,828
He's got them, too.

425
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:40,861
It's got something to do
with the spirit.

426
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:42,694
I don't know what.

427
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:48,661
I know.

428
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:50,528
You think
you're going crazy.

429
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:53,095
But let's skip that part,
shall we?

430
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:55,928
Because the last two people
who saw this thing

431
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:58,295
Died pretty soon after.

432
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:01,295
You hear me?

433
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:05,661
You think i'm gonna die.

434
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:09,161
You need to go to sam.
He'll help.

435
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:12,928
You're giving
your brother up.

436
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:15,861
Go to the first motel
listed in the yellow pages.

437
00:27:15,894 --> 00:27:17,061
Look for jim rockford.

438
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,195
That's how we find each other
when we're separated.

439
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:21,261
You can arrest him,
if you want,

440
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:24,028
Or you can let him
save your life.

441
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:42,661
The showed up
after you saw it?

442
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,727
Yeah, i guess.

443
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:46,095
All right.

444
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:49,261
You're gonna have to tell me
exactly what you saw.

445
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,395
You know,
i must be losing my mind.

446
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:56,028
You're a fugitive.
I should be arresting you.

447
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:57,961
All right,
well, you know what?

448
00:27:57,994 --> 00:28:00,894
You can arrest me later
after you live through this.

449
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:03,226
But right now,
you got to talk to me.

450
00:28:03,227 --> 00:28:04,994
Okay?

451
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:08,128
Okay. Great.

452
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:10,095
Now, the spirit,
what did it look like?

453
00:28:10,128 --> 00:28:14,261
She was, um,
really pale...

454
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:16,028
and her throat was cut.

455
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,061
And her eyes, they were
like this deep, dark red.

456
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:21,794
It appeared like she
was trying to talk to me,

457
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:23,928
But she couldn't.

458
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:27,562
It was just...
a lot of blood.

459
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:30,261
You know what?
Here.

460
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:32,594
I've been researching
every girl who has ever died

461
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,894
Or gone missing
from ashland street.

462
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:37,928
How did you get those?

463
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:40,128
Those are from crime scenes
and booking photos.

464
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,794
You have your job.
I have mine.

465
00:28:43,828 --> 00:28:46,095
Here. I need you
to look through these.

466
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:48,161
Tell me
if you recognize anyone.

467
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:02,128
This is her.

468
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,794
I'm sure of it.

469
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,861
Claire becker?
28 years old.

470
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,994
Disappeared about eight
or nine months ago.

471
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:13,128
But i don't even know her.
Why would she come after me?

472
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:15,395
Well, before her death,

473
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:17,994
She was arrested twice
for dealing heroin.

474
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:19,495
You ever work narcotics?

475
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:22,794
Yeah, pete and i did
before homicide.

476
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:24,794
You ever bust her?

477
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:25,961
Not that i remember.

478
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:32,562
Says she was last seen
entering 2911 ashland street.

479
00:29:32,594 --> 00:29:36,361
Police searched the place,
didn't find anything.

480
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:42,528
Guess we got to check it out,
see if we can find her body.

481
00:29:42,562 --> 00:29:43,794
What?

482
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:48,195
Well, we got to salt
and burn her bones.

483
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:50,661
It's the only way
to put her spirit to rest.

484
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:52,095
Of course it is.

485
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:10,095
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

486
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:12,562
I'll let you know
when we find it.

487
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:07,961
Sam!

488
00:31:11,428 --> 00:31:12,594
Sam!

489
00:31:14,794 --> 00:31:16,694
Sam!

490
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:19,128
Hey, i'm here.

491
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:21,462
What is it?
What happened?

492
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:24,261
Claire.
She was here.

493
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:25,462
Did she attack you?

494
00:31:25,495 --> 00:31:26,661
No.

495
00:31:26,694 --> 00:31:28,562
No, she was just
reaching out to me.

496
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:31,395
She was over there
by the window.

497
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:44,961
Here, help me move this.

498
00:31:44,994 --> 00:31:46,794
All right.

499
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:49,295
I got you.

500
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:55,961
Our little mystery word.

501
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,694
Now the extra letters
make sense.

502
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:18,195
What is that?

503
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,328
Spirits and certain remains

504
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:23,395
Give off
electromagnetic frequencies.

505
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:27,061
So, if claire's body was here,
that would indicate that?

506
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:28,528
Yeah.
Well, that's the theory.

507
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:55,994
Yeah.

508
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:58,228
Yeah, there's definitely
something in there.

509
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:06,328
You know,
this is bothering me.

510
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,661
Well, you are digging up
a corpse.

511
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:10,228
No, not that.

512
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:13,994
That's, uh, pretty par
for the course, actually.

513
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:15,694
Then what?

514
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,228
It's just...

515
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,221
i mean, no vengeful spirit

516
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,861
I've ever tussled with
wanted to be wasted,

517
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:23,694
So why the hell would claire
lead us to her remains?

518
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:26,261
Doesn't make any sense.

519
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:32,528
All right. Here.
Give me your hand.

520
00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:39,828
Okay.

521
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:09,594
Her wrists.

522
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,761
Yeah, they'd be bruised
just like yours.

523
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:26,627
That necklace mean something
to you?

524
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,594
I've seen it before.

525
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:31,095
It's rare.

526
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:33,495
It was custom-Made
over on carson street.

527
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,061
I have one just like it.

528
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:43,462
Pete gave it to me.

529
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:49,871
Now this all
makes perfect sense.

530
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:50,972
I'm sorry?

531
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,072
You see, claire is not
a vengeful spirit.

532
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:54,573
She's a death omen.

533
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:56,606
Excuse me?

534
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,206
Claire's not killing anyone.

535
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,706
She's trying to warn them.

536
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:04,939
Sometimes spirits,
they don't want vengeance.

537
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:08,321
They want justice,
which is why she led us here.
???

538
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:10,306
She wants us to know
who her killer is.

539
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,954
How much do you know
about your partner?

540
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,400
Oh, my god.

541
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:23,521
What?

542
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:26,720
About a year ago,

543
00:35:26,753 --> 00:35:30,054
Some heroin went missing
from lockup.

544
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:32,321
Obviously it was a cop.

545
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:35,420
We never found out
who did it.

546
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:36,620
But whoever did it

547
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:38,820
Would need someone
to fence their product.

548
00:35:38,854 --> 00:35:40,386
Somebody like
a heroin dealer.

549
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:44,620
Somebody like claire.

550
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,054
So, i'm being extradited
to st. Louis, huh?

551
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:57,221
You just decided to transfer me
yourself 800 miles

552
00:35:57,254 --> 00:35:58,486
At 2:00 in the morning?

553
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:05,653
This can't be good.

554
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:07,453
All right. Thanks.

555
00:36:07,486 --> 00:36:08,620
What is it?

556
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:11,908
Pete just left the precinct
with dean.
??

557
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:13,769
He said the prisoner
had to be transferred,

558
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,252
And he just took him.

559
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:17,986
Dispatch has been calling,
but he won't answer the radio.

560
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,253
Radio?
He took a county vehicle?

561
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:22,257
Then it should have
a lojack.

562
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:23,387
You got to get it turned on.

563
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:40,921
Pee break so soon?

564
00:36:40,953 --> 00:36:43,620
I think you might want to get
your prostate checked.

565
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,887
Son of a bitch.

566
00:36:57,086 --> 00:37:00,187
Hey, i'm cool in the van.
You go do what you got to do.

567
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:07,353
You're a cocky
son of a bitch.

568
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:09,454
You think those people
in st. Louis

569
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:10,854
Are gonna buy that crap?

570
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:13,554
Here's the thing.

571
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:15,420
You're not gonna make it
to st. Louis.

572
00:37:16,754 --> 00:37:20,587
You're gonna die
trying to escape.

573
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:24,787
Wait! Wait!

574
00:37:24,821 --> 00:37:26,520
Let's talk about this.

575
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:30,053
You don't want to do something
that you're gonna regret.

576
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:31,587
Or maybe you do.

577
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,554
Pete!
Put the gun down.

578
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:36,587
Diana?
How'd you find me?

579
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,320
I know about claire.

580
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:39,887
I don't know
what you're talking about.

581
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:41,420
Put the gun down!

582
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:43,487
No, i don't think so.

583
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,821
You're fast.

584
00:37:44,854 --> 00:37:46,953
Pretty sure i'm faster.

585
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,187
Why are you doing this?

586
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,086
I didn't do anything,
diana.

587
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,587
It's a little late
for that.

588
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,053
It wasn't my fault.

589
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:58,854
Claire was gonna turn me in.
I had no choice.

590
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:01,420
And tony? Karen?

591
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:02,754
Same thing.

592
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:05,153
Tony scrubbed the money.
Then he got skittish.

593
00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:06,953
And then he wanted
to come clean.

594
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:09,921
I'm sure he told karen
everything.

595
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,787
It was a mess.
I had to clean it up.

596
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:14,220
I just panicked.

597
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,720
How many more people
are gonna die over this, pete?

598
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:18,620
There's a way out.

599
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:22,620
This dean kid
is a friggin' gift.

600
00:38:22,654 --> 00:38:24,720
We can pin the whole thing
on him.

601
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:26,887
Okay?
No trial, nothing.

602
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:29,020
Just one more dead scumbag.

603
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:30,654
Hey!

604
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:34,253
No one will question it.

605
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:36,587
Diana, please.

606
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,187
I still love you.

607
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:46,420
Thank you.

608
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Thank you.

609
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,420
Then why don't you buy me
another necklace, you ass?

610
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:06,253
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

611
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,474
Sam:
you doing all right?

612
00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:00,893
Not really.

613
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:05,060
The death omen, claire,
what happens to her now?

614
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:06,828
It should be over.

615
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,627
She should be at rest.

616
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:12,999
So, uh, what now,
officer?

617
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,666
Pete did confess to me.

618
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:17,267
He screwed up
both your cases royally.

619
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,434
There's a good chance

620
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:20,434
That we can get
your cases dismissed.

621
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:22,233
You could take care
of that for us?

622
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:23,367
I hope so.

623
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,566
But the st. Louis
murder charges?

624
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,766
That's another story.

625
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,833
I-I can't help you.

626
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:34,133
Unless i just happened
to turn my back

627
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:35,500
And you walked away.

628
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,833
I could tell them
that the suspects escaped.

629
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:38,900
Wait. Are you sure?

630
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:40,133
Yeah, she's sure, sam.

631
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:43,167
You could lose your job
over something like that.

632
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,766
I just want you guys out there,
doing what you do best.

633
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,267
Trust me.
I'll sleep better at night.

634
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,599
Listen,
you need to watch your back.

635
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:53,534
They're gonna be looking
for both of you right now.

636
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:56,400
Get out of here.
I got to radio this in.

637
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:57,866
Hey, uh...

638
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,534
you wouldn't happen to know
where my car is by chance?

639
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:03,233
It's at the impound yard
on robertson.

640
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:06,367
Don't even think about it.

641
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,766
It's okay. It's all right.
Don't worry.

642
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,400
We'll just improvise.
We're pretty good at that.

643
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,766
Yeah. I've noticed.

644
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:19,733
Nice lady.

645
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:21,866
Yeah, for a cop.

646
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,167
Did she look familiar
to you?

647
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,400
No. Why?

648
00:41:24,434 --> 00:41:25,966
I don't know.
It's nothing.

649
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,233
Hey, you hungry?
I could go for some pea soup.

650
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:34,267
