1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,220
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off...

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,430
saving people,
hunting things.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,800
The family business.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,100
THEN

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,750
I have these nightmares,
and sometimes they come true.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,380
Come again ?

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,890
I dreamt about Jessica's death
before it happened.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,540
A vision.
Started out as nightmares.

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,350
Then he started having them
while he was awake.

10
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,670
The closer I get to anything involving
the demon, the stronger the visions get.

11
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,320
The demon said he had plans
for me and the children like me.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,060
Do you have any idea
what he meant by that ?

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,370
No, I don't.

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,400
Max, your abilities...
they started six,seven months ago, right ?

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,200
How'd you know that ?

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
'Cause that's when
my abilities started.

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,540
The same thing
killed our mothers.

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,480
You and I are chosen.

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,510
- For what ?
- I don't know.

20
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,110
The thing I don't get is why.
I guess because we're so alike ?

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,470
Max is nothing like you.
Sam, Max is a monster.

22
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,420
He's already killed two people.
Now he's gunning for a third.

23
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,440
Did he say anything
to you ?

24
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,190
No.

25
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,890
Nothing.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,090
NOW

27
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,570
Hello ? Yeah.

28
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,380
All right.

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,010
- Afternoon, Dennis.
- Hey, Doc.

30
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,240
I'd like to look at a gun.

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, right, Doc.

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,670
Seriously ?

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,520
That one.

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,790
Okay.

35
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,670
That's a turkey hunter.
12-gauge. Pump-action.

36
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,610
Don't leave enough
turkey behind, if you ask me.

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,690
What, uh, what sort of shells
does it use ?

38
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,740
Right here.

39
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,260
I'm taking the boys up to the
cabin this weekend, if you're, uh...

40
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,300
I mean, if you think you might
like to take up the sport.

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,390
Thanks, but no.

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,930
You know guns make me nervous.
Always have.

43
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,820
This one goes in here, right ?

44
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,050
Whoa. Doc !  No, no, you can't load a weapon
on the premises. It's illegal !

45
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,640
- It's okay, Dennis.
- No, no.

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
It's okay, Dennis.
It's all gonna be...

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,040
...okay.

48
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,440
Doc !

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,070
What's going on ?

50
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,540
No, no, it's okay.
It's okay.

51
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,930
It's all gonna be...okay.

52
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,730
Sam, come on, zip it up.
Let's hit the...

53
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,010
road.

54
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,470
What ?

58
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,760
I don't know, man.
Why don't we just chill out, think about this ?

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,550
What's there to think about ?

60
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,900
Just don't know if going to the roadhouse
is the smartest idea.

61
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,010
Dean, it's another premonition.
I know it.

62
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,250
This is gonna happen, and ash can tell us where.
Plus it could have some connection with the demon.

63
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,570
- My visions always do.
- That's my point.

64
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,480
There's gonna be hunters there.
I don't know if...

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,390
if going in and announcing
that you're some supernatural freak

66
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,590
with a demonic connection
is the best thing, okay ?

67
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,450
So I'm a freak now ?

68
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,920
You've always been a freak.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,060
SIMON SAID

70
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,040
Damn, little lady,
that was my room money.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,560
Then I guess you're taking
a truck nap tonight.

72
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,080
I'd have checked the high scores
before you put your money down.

73
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,820
Went and got yourself
hustled, Ed.

74
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,990
Just can't stay away, huh ?

75
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,580
Yeah, looks like.
How you doing, Jo ?

76
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,680
- Where's ash ?
- In his back room.

77
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,700
- Great.
- And I'm fine.

78
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,820
Sorry. He's we're kind of
on a bit of a timetable.

79
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,810
Ash ?

80
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,220
The conditions that led
to the sharpsville tragedy...

81
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,390
hey, Ash ?

82
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,120
Hey, Dr. Badass ?

83
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,450
Sam. Dean.

84
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,110
Sam and Dean.

85
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,340
Hey, Ash,
um, we need your help.

86
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,660
Hell, then,
guess I need my pants.

87
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,210
BLUERIDGE

88
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,980
So, I got a match. It's the logo
for the blue ridge bus lines.

89
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,930
Guthrie, Oklahoma.

90
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,440
Okay. Do me a favor. Check guthrie for any
demonic signs or omens or anything like that.

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,170
You think the demon
is there ?

92
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,250
Yeah. Maybe.

93
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,740
- Why would you think that ?
- Just check it, all right ?

94
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,280
No, sir, nothing.
No demon.

95
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,110
All right.
Try something else for me.

96
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,440
Search guthrie for a house fire.
It would be 1983.

97
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,580
Fire's origin would be a baby's nursery,
night of the kid's 6-month birthday.

98
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,650
Okay, now, that is just weird, man.

99
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,560
Why the hell would I be looking for that ?

100
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,070
'Cause there's a pbr
in it for you.

101
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,720
Give me 15 minutes.

102
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,590
What ?

103
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,130
- R.E.O. Speedwagon ?
- Damn right, R.E.O.

104
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
Kevin Cronin sings it
from the heart.

105
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,010
He sings it from the hair.
There's a difference.

106
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,600
That profile you've got Ash
looking for ?

107
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,940
Your mom died the same way,
didn't she...

108
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,400
the fire in sam's nursery ?

109
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,940
- Look, Jo, it's kind of a family thing.
- I could help.

110
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm sure you could, but we got to handle
this one ourselves.

111
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,590
Besides, if I ran off with you,
think your mother might kill me.

112
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,440
You're afraid of my mother ?

113
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,270
I think so.

114
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,220
We have a match.
We got to go.

115
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,830
All right, Jo, see you later.

116
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,670
And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight

117
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:19,420
you're a candle in the window
on a cold, dark winter's night

118
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,550
and I'm getting closer
than I ever thought

119
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,580
I mi-ight

120
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,440
you're kidding, right ?

121
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,770
I heard the song somewhere. I can't get it
out of my head. I don't know, man. What do you got ?

122
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,480
Andrew Gallagher.

123
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,930
Born in '83, like me.

124
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,890
Lost his mother in a nursery fire
exactly six months later,

125
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,060
also like me.

126
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,750
You think the demon
killed his mom ?

127
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,650
Sure looks like it.

128
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,940
How did you know
to look for this guy ?

129
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,110
Every premonition I've had,
if they're not about the demon,

130
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,480
they're about the other kids
the demon visited.

131
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,840
Like Max Miller.
Remember him ?

132
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,450
Yeah, but Max Miller
was a basic little psycho.

133
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,790
Point is he was killing people, and I was having
the same type of visions about him.

134
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,450
And now it could be happening all over again
with this gallagher guy.

135
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,980
- How do we find him ?
- I don't know.

136
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,520
No current address,
no current employment.

137
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,750
Still owes money on all his bills...
phone, credit, utilities.

138
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,730
Collection agency flags ?

139
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,210
Not in the system.

140
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,910
They just let him take a walk ?

141
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,660
Seems like it.

142
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,400
There's a work address
from his last w-2 about a year ago.

143
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,450
Let's start there.

144
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,840
You won't get anything out of Andy, guys.
I'm sorry, but they never do.

145
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,500
"They" ?

146
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,760
You're debt collectors, right ?

147
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Once in a while,
they come by.

148
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,260
I don't know what andy says to them,
but they never come back.

149
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,750
Actually,we're lawyers
representing his great-aunt Lita.

150
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,660
She passed god rest her soul...
but left andy a sizable estate.

151
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,680
Yeah. So, are you
a friend of his ?

152
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,150
I used to be, yeah.
I don't see much of andy anymore.

153
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,690
- Andy ?  Andy kicks ass, man.
- Is that right ?

154
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah.
Andy can get you into anything.

155
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,530
He even got me backstage
at aerosmith once. It was beautiful, Bro.

156
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,940
How about busing a table
or two, Webber ?

157
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,270
Yeah, you bet, boss.

158
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,880
Look, if you want to find him,
try orchard street.

159
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,210
Just look for a van
with the barbarian queen painted on the side.

160
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,730
Barbarian Queen.

161
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,880
She's riding a polar bear.
It's kind of hard to miss.

162
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,870
I'm sorry. I'm starting to like this dude.
That van is sweet.

163
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,860
- What's wrong ?
- Nothing.

164
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,310
Sam, you look like
you're sucking on a lemon.

165
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,190
This Andrew Gallagher...
he's the second guy like this we've found, Dean.

166
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,170
Demon came to them when they were kids.
Now they're killing people.

167
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,630
We don't know what Andrew Gallagher is.
Could be innocent.

168
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,160
My visions haven't
been wrong yet.

169
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,760
What's your point ?

170
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,850
- My point is I'm one of them.
- No, you're not.

171
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,760
Dean, the demon said he had plans for me
and children like me.

172
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,690
Yeah ?

173
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,660
Maybe this is his plan.
Maybe we're all a bunch of psychic freaks.

174
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,430
Maybe we're all supposed
to be...

175
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,390
- killers ?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,340
So the demon wants you out
there, killing with your minds ?

177
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,310
Give me a break.
You're not a murderer, Sam !

178
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,850
You don't have it
in your bones.

179
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,270
No ?

180
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,760
Last I checked,
I kill all kinds of things.

181
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,090
Those things
were asking for it.

182
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,330
There's a difference.

183
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,080
Got him.

184
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,190
that's him, that older guy.
He's the shooter.

185
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,640
Well, you keep on him.
I'll stick with Andy.

186
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,520
- Hey !
- Hey.

187
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,590
- This is a cherry ride.
- Yeah. Thanks.

188
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,840
Man,you know, '67...
impala's best year, if you ask me.

189
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,630
This is a serious classic.

190
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,480
You know, I just rebuilt her, too.
Can't let a car like this one go.

191
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
Damn straight.

192
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,050
- Hey. Could I have it ?
- Sure, man.

193
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,350
Sweet.

194
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,980
Hop right in there.
There you go. Very nice.

195
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,670
- Take it easy.
- All right.

196
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,230
Hello ?
Yeah.

197
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,250
Hello ?
Yeah.

198
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,310
Dean,
Andy's got the impala !

199
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,970
I know ! He just sort of asked me for it,
and I let him take it.

200
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,760
You what ?

201
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,400
He full-on obi-wan'd me.
It's mind control, man.

202
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,620
I kept him
out of the gun store.

203
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,060
I thought he was okay.

204
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,750
I thought he was past it.
At least...

205
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,510
I should've
stayed with him.

206
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,050
Andy !
What's up, dog ?

207
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,420
Andy.

208
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,390
What are you doing here ?

209
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,040
D-dr. Jennings.

210
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,610
He's dead.

211
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,910
Oh, no, I-I'm sorry.

212
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,280
I don't know.
I-I...

213
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,140
I just I was upset,
and I wanted to see you.

214
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,670
Well, I'm glad you did.
I,um...

215
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,700
I missed you.

216
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,500
Oh, you know what ?  Some guys were here
this morning, looking for you.

217
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,890
What guys ?

218
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,110
Thank god !

219
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,930
I'm sorry, baby.
I'll never leave you again.

220
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,810
At least he left
the keys in it.

221
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,580
Yeah.
Real samaritan, this guy.

222
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,570
It looks like he can't work his mojo just by
twitching his nose. He's got to use verbal commands.

223
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,330
The doctor had just gotten off his cellphone
when he stepped in front of that bus.

224
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,280
Andy must've called him
or something.

225
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,640
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Beg your pardon ?

226
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,070
I just don't know
if he's our guy, Sam.

227
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,670
You had O.J. Convicted before he got out
of his bronco,and you have doubts about this ?

228
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,530
He doesn't seem like
the stone-cold killer type. That's all.

229
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,040
And O.J. Was guilty.

230
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,460
Either way,how are we gonna
track this guy down ?

231
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,200
Not a problem.

232
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,330
Not exactly
an inconspicuous ride.

233
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,780
Let's have a look.

234
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,140
Oh, come on.

235
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,700
This is this is magnificent.
That's what this is.

236
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,620
Not exactly a serial killer's
lair, though.

237
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,190
There's no clown paintings
on the walls

238
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,770
or scissors stuck
in victims' photos.

239
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,840
I like the tiger.

240
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,690
Hegel ? Kant ?

241
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,650
Wittgenstein ?
That's some pretty heavy reading, Dean.

242
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,090
Yeah, and,uh...

243
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,940
Moby Dick's bong.

244
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,580
You know, one day I'd love
to just sit down

245
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,370
and eat something that
I didn't have to microwave at a minimart.

246
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,230
What I don't get is the motive.
The doctor was squeaky clean.

247
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,790
Why would andy waste him ?

248
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,430
If it is Andy.

249
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,480
- Dude, enough.
- Why ?

250
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,920
The doctor was mind-controlled
in front of a bus.

251
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,300
Andy just happens to have
the power of mind control. You do the math.

252
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,990
I don't think the guy
has it in him.

253
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,260
How the hell
would you know ?

254
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,850
Why are you bending over
backwards defending him ?

255
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,930
'Cause you're not right
about this.

256
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,540
About Andy ?

257
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,030
Hey ! You think
I haven't seen you two ?

258
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,550
Why are you following me ?

259
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,850
Well, we're lawyers.
A relative of yours has...

260
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,880
- tell the truth !
- That's what...

261
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,670
- we hunt demons.
- What ?

262
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,350
Demons and spirits. Things your worst nightmares
wouldn't even touch.

263
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,120
- Sam's my brother.
- Dean, shut up.

264
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,160
I'm trying. He's psychic,like you.
Well, not really like you.

265
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,620
He thinks you're a murderer,

266
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,160
and he's afraid he's gonna become one himself
cause you're all part of something that's terrible.

267
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,790
I hope to hell that he's wrong,
but I'm starting to get scared he might be right.

268
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,070
Okay, you know what ?
Just leave me alone.

269
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,260
All right ?

270
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,100
What are you doing ?
Look, I-I said, leave me alone.

271
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,110
Get out of here !
Just start driving and never stop !

272
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,120
Doesn't seem to work
on me, Andy.

273
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,480
What ?

274
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,080
You can make people do things,
can't you ?

275
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,940
You can tell them
what to think.

276
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,950
That's crazy.

277
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,170
All started a year ago,
didn't it ?

278
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,000
After you turned 22. Little stuff at first,
then you got better at controlling it.

279
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,170
How do you know all this ?

280
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,720
'Cause the same thing happened to me, Andy.
My mom died in a fire, too.

281
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,300
I have abilities, too.

282
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,760
You see, we're connected,
you and me.

283
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,840
Just...
just get out of here !

284
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,520
Why did you tell the doctor
to walk in front of a bus ?

285
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,320
What ?

286
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,040
- Why did you kill him ?
- I didn't.

287
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,990
Hello ?

288
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,580
Sure.

289
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
I can do that.

290
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,650
Hey !

291
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,370
- Lady,what are you doing ?!
- It's gonna be okay.

292
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,260
Lady, no. No !

293
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,570
Sam ?  What is it ?

294
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,530
I didn't do anything
to him.

295
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,980
A woman.
A woman burning alive.

296
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,710
What else you get ?

297
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,070
A gas station.
A woman is gonna kill herself.

298
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,500
What does he mean,
"going to" ?

299
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,230
Shut up.

300
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,480
She gets triggered by a call
on her cell.

301
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,320
- When ?
- I don't know.

302
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,990
As long as we keep our eyes
on this son of a bitch, he can't hurt her.

303
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,160
- I didn't hurt anybody !
- Yeah, not yet.

304
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,170
Go.

305
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,290
No. Not you.

306
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,720
You're staying here
with me.

307
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,290
Hey, it's me. She's dead.
Burned up,just like you said.

308
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,180
When ?

309
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,780
Minutes before I got here.
The smell hasn't even cleared.

310
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,090
What's up with your visions ?
This wasn't even a head start.

311
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,920
I can't control them.
I don't know what the hell is going on.

312
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,120
You were with andy when this whole
thing went down, so it can't be him.

313
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,710
It's got to be
somebody else.

314
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,750
That doesn't make any sense.

315
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,810
What else is new ? I'll dig around here,
see what else I can find.

316
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,600
You get these premonitions
of people about to die ?

317
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,870
That's impossible.

318
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,280
A lot of people would say the same
thing about what you do.

319
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,890
- Death visions ?
- Yeah.

320
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,950
Dude, that sucks.

321
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,590
When I got my mind thing,
it was like a gift.

322
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,030
It was like I won
the lotto.

323
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,730
But you still live
in a van.

324
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,500
I don't get it. You could have anything
you ever wanted.

325
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,400
Yeah, but I-I got
everything I need.

326
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,470
So you're really
not a killer, huh ?

327
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,420
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

328
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,520
That's good.

329
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,810
That means there's hope
for both of us.

330
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,950
Victim's name
was Holly Beckett. 41. Single.

331
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,360
- Who is she ?
- Never heard of her.

332
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,050
I called ash on the way over.
He came up with a little something.

333
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,610
Apparently Holly Beckett gave
birth when she was 18 years old,back in 1983...

334
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,980
same day you were born, Andy.

335
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,520
Andy, were you adopted ?

336
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,720
Well, yeah.

337
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,930
You were ?
And you neglected to mention that ?

338
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,370
It never really came up.
I mean, I never knew my birth parents,

339
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,310
and,like you said,
my adopted mom died when I was a baby.

340
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,590
Do you think this Holly woman
could actually be...

341
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,750
I don't know. Tried to get a copy of the birth
records, but they're sealed in the county office.

342
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,040
Well, screw that.

343
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,990
Probably shouldn't have
let you kids in here.

344
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,230
No. It'll all be fine,
all right ?

345
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,920
Just go get a cup of coffee,
all right ?

346
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,810
These aren't
the droids you're looking for.

347
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,220
Awesome.

348
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,880
- I got it.
- Yeah ?

349
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,150
Yeah.

350
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,220
Andy, it's true.

351
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,900
Holly Beckett
was your birth mother.

352
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,850
Does anyone have a vicodin ?

353
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,890
Dr. Jennings
was her doctor, too.

354
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,020
I mean,
he oversaw the adoption.

355
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,090
You have a solid connection
to both of them.

356
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,720
- Yeah, but I didn't kill them.
- We believe you.

357
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,800
- Yeah.
- But, uh, who did ?

358
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,250
I think I got
a pretty good guess.

359
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,020
Holly Beckett gave birth
to twins.

360
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,180
I have an evil twin.

361
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,770
Holly put you and your brother
up for adoption.

362
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,410
And you went to the gallagher
family, obviously,

363
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,410
and your brother went to
the weems family from upstate.

364
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,910
Andy, how you doing ?
Still with us ?

365
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,110
Um...what was
my brother's name ?

366
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,780
Here.
Um, Ansem Weems ?

367
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,500
- He's got a local address.
- He lives here ?

368
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,170
Let's get a look at him.

369
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,930
Got his picture coming over
from the dmv right now.

370
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,480
Hate to kick you
while you're freaked.

371
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,860
Take a look at that.

372
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,950
- Hey, Trace ?
- Yeah ?

373
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,060
You and Andy, you guys went together
for a while, didn't you ?

374
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,250
Yeah, Webber, why ?

375
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,610
I don't know. Just wondering.
I was wondering how you felt about him these days.

376
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,170
I mean, I've seen you guys together.
It seems like there's still something there.

377
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,740
Were you guys ever,
like,serious ?

378
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,940
Um...no.

379
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,670
Come on, Trace.
Tell the truth.

380
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,550
All right, Andy, tell us everything you know
about this guy.

381
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,360
I don't know much. Webber shows up one day
like eight months ago,

382
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,510
acting like he's my best friend
in the world.

383
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,070
He's kind of weird, like trying
too hard,you know ?

384
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,790
He must've known you guys
are twins.

385
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,290
Why did he change his name ?
Why not tell you the truth ?

386
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,300
Sam ?

387
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,210
- Sam ?
- Oh, god !

388
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,130
Sam ?!

389
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,730
Sam !

390
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,630
Hey. Hey !

391
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,940
I take my ladies here.

392
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,840
They like it.

393
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,590
Well, I mean, I like it,
so, of course, they do, too.

394
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,600
Please.
I just want to go home.

395
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,260
Stop crying.

396
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,120
Hey.

397
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,110
I get it.
I see what you see in Andy.

398
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,400
I mean,he's a genius.
The books he reads...

399
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,280
he's gonna be a great man
someday.

400
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,940
But he is my family,
not yours.

401
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,230
You can't have him.

402
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,460
You're not gonna have anything
after tonight.

403
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,530
Dean,
you should stay back.

404
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,660
No argument here. I had my head screwed with
enough for one day.

405
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,910
- I'm coming with you.
- Andy...

406
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,630
that's tracy out there,
and I'm coming.

407
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,270
Okay.
Ch-chslower.

408
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,940
Tracy...

409
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,260
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, okay ?

410
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,740
When we're done here...

411
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,320
...I want you to head over
to the edge of that dam, okay ?

412
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,060
Okay.

413
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,920
And when you get there...

414
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,560
...you're gonna think
you can fly.

415
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,880
And you're just
gonna step right off.

416
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,140
You you can fly, can't you ?

417
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,760
Yeah.
I think so.

418
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,500
You might get scared,

419
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,370
but I want you to say
that it's okay.

420
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,940
Just tell yourself,
"everything is okay."

421
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,720
Get out of the car !
Now !

422
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,080
You really don't want
to do this.

423
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,750
Trace, give me your hand.
Come here, come here.

424
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,870
I couldn't control myself.

425
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,830
Hey ! Don't move.
Don't move !

426
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,420
- No ! No !
- I will kill you !

427
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,940
Andy ! Hey, hey, hey ! No !
No ! I'll handle this !

428
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,260
I will kill you !

429
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,110
Andy, listen to me !
Just listen to me !

430
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,780
Tracy, stop !
I said, stop it !

431
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,840
- How did you do that ?
- Practice, Bro.

432
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,160
If you just practiced,
you would know.

433
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,320
Sometimes...
you don't need to use your words.

434
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,970
If you have to,
all you need is this.

435
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,990
Sometimes the headache
is worth it.

436
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,470
You twisted
son of a bitch !

437
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,690
Back off, Andy !
Or tracy is gonna do a little flying.

438
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,570
Aren't you, Trace ?

439
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,440
I'm stronger than you.
I can do it.

440
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,140
Okay, okay. Okay.

441
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,340
All right,just...
please don't hurt her.

442
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,550
Don't be mad at me, okay ?
I know. It's all wrong.

443
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,110
I didn't mean for this
to happen. It's just...

444
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,240
Tracy...

445
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,030
she's trying
to come between us.

446
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,880
- You're insane.
- She's garbage !

447
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,640
Man, they all are !

448
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,380
We can push them.
We can make them do whatever we want !

449
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,240
Are you really...
are you really this stupid ? Is it...

450
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,020
you learn you got a twin,

451
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,540
you call him up,
you go out for a drink.

452
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,700
You don't start
killing people !

453
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,610
I wanted to tell you
for so long, Bro, but...

454
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,770
he didn't let me.
He said I had to wait until the time...

455
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,190
- who ?
- The man with the yellow eyes.

456
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,700
What are you talking about ?

457
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,300
He came to me...
in my dream.

458
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,200
He said I was special.

459
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,950
He told me he's got
big plans for me.

460
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,830
Wait till you see
what's in store, Andy, for both of us.

461
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:33,870
See, he's the one who told me
that I had a brother, a twin.

462
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,720
Why did you kill
our mother ?

463
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,410
And why Dr. Jennings ?

464
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,120
Because they split us up !

465
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,290
They ruined our lives,
Andy !

466
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,430
We could've been together
this whole time

467
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,040
instead of alone.

468
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,920
I couldn't let them do that.
I couldn't let them get away with that.

469
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,920
No.

470
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,490
I see you.

471
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,740
Bye-bye.

472
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,980
*************

473
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,920
And you all saw it happen.

474
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,020
Yeah.
We did.

475
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,400
Look at him.
He's getting better at it.

476
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,400
She won't even
look at me.

477
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,350
Yeah,
she's pretty shaken up.

478
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,500
No,it's...
this is different.

479
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,630
This is...

480
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:40,070
I never used my mind thing
on her before, before last night.

481
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,040
She's scared of me now.

482
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,380
Andy, I hate to do this,
but, um...

483
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,600
we have to get out of here.
Here.

484
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,160
I wrote down my cell.

485
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,810
You don't have to be alone in this, all right ?
If anything comes up, you can call me up.

486
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,340
Wh-what am I supposed
to do now ?

487
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,690
You be good, Andy...

488
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,040
or we'll be back.

489
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,620
Looks like I was right.

490
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,480
- About what ?
- Andy.

491
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,450
He's a killer after all.

492
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,010
No, he's a hero. He saved his girlfriend's life.
He saved my life.

493
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,440
Bottom line,
last night he wasted somebody.

494
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,110
Yeah, but he's not
a foaming-at-the-mouth psycho.

495
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,060
He was just...
he was pushed into that.

496
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,300
Webber was pushed, too,
in his own way.

497
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,040
Max Miller was pushed.
Hell,I was pushed by Jessica's death.

498
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,070
What's your point, Sam ?

499
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,810
Right circumstances,
everyone is capable of murder everyone.

500
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,240
Maybe that's what the demon is doing...
pushing us, finding ways to break us.

501
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,930
We don't know what the demon
wants, okay ?

502
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,030
Quit worrying about it.

503
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,950
You know, I heard you before,dean,
when andy made you tell the truth.

504
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,280
You're just as scared
of this as I am.

505
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,140
That was mind control ! It's like being roofied
man. That doesn't count.

506
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,890
- No,I-I'm calling do-over.
- What are you, 7 ?

507
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,310
Doesn't matter. We just got to keep doing
what we're doing,

508
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,500
find that evil son of a bitch,
and kill it.

509
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,460
Yeah. I guess.

510
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,670
Hello ?

511
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,190
Ellen.
What's going on ?

512
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,640
Yeah. We'll be right there.

513
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,400
Jo ?

514
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,180
Go pull up
another case of beer.

515
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,420
- Mom...
- now. Please ?

516
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,860
So, you, uh, you want to tell me
about this last hunt of yours ?

517
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,670
- Nope.
- Not really.

518
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,060
No offense.
Just kind of a family thing.

519
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,450
Not anymore.

520
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,500
I got this stuff from ash.

521
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,430
Andrew gallagher's house burned down on
his 6-month birthday, just like your house.

522
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,760
You think it was the demon both times, don't you ?
You think it went after Gallagher's family ?

523
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,850
- Yeah, we think so.
- Sam.

524
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,030
- Why ?
- None of your business.

525
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,020
You mind your tongue
with me,boy.

526
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,050
This isn't just your war.
This is war.

527
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,550
Something big and bad is coming, and it's
coming fast, and their side holds all the cards.

528
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,140
Now, at best, all we got is us...
together.

529
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,970
No secrets or half-truths here.

530
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,310
There are people
out there

531
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,800
like Andy Gallagher...

532
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,780
like me...

533
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,570
and, um...

534
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,330
we all have some kind
of ability.

535
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,970
- Ability ?
- Yeah.

536
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,240
A psychic ability.

537
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,310
Me, I have, um...

538
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,820
I have visions...

539
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,350
premonitions. I don't know.
It's different for everybody.

540
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,460
The demon said he had plans
for people like us.

541
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,920
What kind of plans ?

542
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,140
We don't really
know for sure.

543
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,880
These people out there,
these psychics, are they dangerous ?

544
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,760
No.

545
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,140
Not all of them.

546
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,280
But some are.
Some are very dangerous.

547
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,630
How many ?

548
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,100
We've been able to track
a clear pattern so far.

549
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,900
They've all had house fires
on the night of the kid's 6-month birthday.

550
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,000
That's not true.

551
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,010
What ?

552
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:48,290
Webber or ansem weems
or whatever his name is...

553
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,050
I looked at his files,
and there was no house fire.

554
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,930
There's nothing
out of the ordinary.

555
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,110
Which breaks pattern.
So if there's any others like him,

556
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,950
there would be nothing
in the system,

557
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,090
no way to track them
all down.

558
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,540
And so who knows how many
of them are really out there ?

559
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,540
- Jo, honey ?
- Yeah ?

560
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,200
You better break out
the whiskey instead.
