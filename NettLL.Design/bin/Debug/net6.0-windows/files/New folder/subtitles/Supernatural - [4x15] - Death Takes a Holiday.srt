No,this is not devil worship.

185
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,320
This -- This is -- This --

186
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,530
This is,uh...

187
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,330
I don't have a good answer.

188
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,760
Look,we're leaving.

189
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,210
You're not going anywhere...

190
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,820
.Ever again...

191
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,730
...sam.

192
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,700
Alastair.

193
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,590
I thought you got deep fried,extra-Crispy.

194
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,570
Nah.

195
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,810
Just the pediatrician I was riding.

196
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,890
His wife's still looking for him.

197
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,720
It's hilarious.

198
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,480
Anyway...

199
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,210
No time to chat.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,810
Got a hot date with death.

201
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,850
Dean!

202
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,620
Alastair: you're stronger,sam.

203
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,280
You've been soloflexing with your little slut?

204
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,270
You have no idea.

205
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,650
How you doing?

206
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,790
I'm in pain,that's how I'm doing.

207
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,200
I think I have a concussion.

208
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,080
You want some aspirin?

209
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,610
No thanks,house.

210
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,920
So,demons,huh?

211
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,770
Yeah. So much for miracles.

212
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,970
And what the hell happened with alastair again?

213
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,280
I told you,he tried to fling me or whatever,

214
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,720
And it didn't work,so he bailed.

215
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,690
Well,how come he couldn't fling you?

216
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,250
He chucked you pretty good last time.

217
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,410
Got no idea.

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,300
Sam, do me a favor.

219
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,200
If you're gonna keep
your little secrets,

220
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
I can't really stop you, But

221
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,300
just don't treat me
like an idiot, okay?

222
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,800
What? Dean,
I'm not keeping secrets.

223
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,500
Mm-Hmm.

224
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Whatever.

225
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
So, did you go back
and q-And-A the dead kid?

226
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,900
Didn't have to.

227
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,100
Bobby called.

228
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
He did some digging.

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,900
And?

230
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,200
He thinks I'm right.

231
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,300
Local reaper's gone.

232
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
Not just gone --
Kidnapped.

233
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,400
By demons?
Why?

234
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Listen to this.

235
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,800
"And he bloodied death
under the newborn sky --

236
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Sweet to taste,
but bitter when once devoured."

237
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,000
Swanky.
What the hell's that mean?

238
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,900
Well, it's from a very obscure,
very arcane version Of revelations.

239
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,100
Which means
what I think it means?

240
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,600
Basically, you kill a reaper
under the solstice moon --

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Tomorrow night, by the way --
You got yourself a broken seal.

242
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How do you ice a reaper?
You can't kill death.

243
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
I don't know.
Maybe demons can.

244
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,600
Where the hell are the angels is what I
want to know. We could use their help for once.

245
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,600
It looks like we're gonna have to
Take care of this one ourselves.

246
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,200
What are we gonna do, Just swing in
and save the friendly neighborhood reaper?

247
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,700
You got a better idea,
I'm all ears.

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
Dean,
reapers are invisible.

249
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,600
The only people that can see them
Are the dead and the dying.

250
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,500
Well, if ghosts are the only ones
That can see them...

251
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Yeah?

252
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,800
...then we become ghosts.

253
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,900
You do have a concussion.

254
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,100
Sounds crazy, I know.

255
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,400
It is crazy.

256
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,000
How?

257
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
I can't even begin to tell you
how crazy you two are.

258
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,700
Well, pamela, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

259
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Aw, that's sweet,
grumpy.

260
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,100
What do you say
to deaf people?

261
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,300
Which one of you brainiacs
Came up with astral projection?

262
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Yo.

263
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Of course.
Chachi.

264
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,900
- Chachi.
- So, let's be clear --

265
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,100
You want to rip your souls
out of your bodies

266
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,800
And take a little stroll
through the spirit world?

267
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,400
Mm-Hmm.

268
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,700
Do you have any idea how
heavy-Duty insane that is?

269
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,800
Maybe, but that's
where the reaper is, so...

270
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,200
So, it's nuts.

271
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,500
Not if you know
what you're doing.

272
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,800
You don't know
what you're doing.

273
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,700
No, but you do.

274
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, I do.
And guess what?

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,800
I'm sick of being hauled Back into
your angel-Demon, soc-Greaser crap.

276
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,700
Look, I'd love to be kicking back with
a cold one, Watching "judge judy," too.

277
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,500
Nice.

278
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,200
- More blind jokes?
- You know what I mean.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
We're talking the end of
the world here, okay?

280
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,500
No more tasseled leather pants,
no more ramones cds,

281
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,700
No more nothing.

282
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,500
We need your help.

283
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,700
Tell me something,
geniuses.

284
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,300
Even if you do break into
the veil And you find the reaper,

285
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,600
How you gonna save it?

286
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,100
With style and class.

287
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,800
You're gonna be two walking pieces of
fog Who can't touch or move anything.

288
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,900
You'll be defenseless,
hotshot.

289
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,300
I seem to recall a bunch of ghosts
Beating the crap out of us.

290
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,700
Yeah, they had plenty
of time to practice.

291
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
Well, then, I guess
we got to start cramming.

292
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,300
Wow, couple of heroes.

293
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
All right.

294
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Lie down.

295
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,500
Close your eyes.

296
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Animum vult decipi,
ergo decipiatur.

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Vis, vis, vis.

298
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,500
Okay, guys.

299
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,700
That's it.
Showtime.

300
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,700
Well, nothing like
shooting blanks.

301
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,800
What's plan "b"?

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Oh, I'm so feeling up
demi moore.

303
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,000
All right, so,

304
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm assuming you're somewhere
over the rainbow.

305
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,000
Remember, I have to
bring you back.

306
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,400
I'll whisper the incantation
in your ear.

307
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,900
You have got a great ass.

308
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,100
What'd she --
What'd she say?

309
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,700
That was wild.

310
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,500
Am I making you
uncomfortable?

311
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Get out of me.

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
You're such a prude.
Come on.

313
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,200
Oh, man, we've been
spooking this town for hours.

314
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,300
No demons,
no black smoke.

315
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
I say we hit victoria's secret
And get our peep on, huh?

316
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,900
Hey, hey, hey, 3:00.

317
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,900
Kid in the window.

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,900
Am I crazy or is he looking at us?

319
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,900
It's 'cause
we've seen him before.

320
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,000
- We have?
- Newspaper.

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,100
Cole griffith, the last person
to die in this town.

322
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Cole?

323
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,200
It's mom.

324
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,500
Your dad thinks I'm crazy.

325
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,400
Are you here?

326
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
A picture frame fell over.

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I could have sworn
it was you, baby.

328
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you still here with me?

329
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Oh, my god!

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
Stop!
How are you doing that?

331
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,200
- Who are you?
- Relax, cole. It's okay.

332
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,200
How do you know my name?

333
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,700
Look, this isn't gonna
be easy to hear,

334
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,900
But you're dead.

335
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,600
You're a spirit.
Us too.

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,600
Yeah, thanks, haley joel.
I know I'm dead.

337
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,600
What do you want?

338
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,800
We just want to talk.

339
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,600
About what?

340
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,700
I was outside all morning.

341
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,900
They tell you to be careful
when it's cold.

342
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,800
Cold air can cause
an asthma attack?

343
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,900
But then I was in my room.

344
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,500
It happened so fast.

345
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,000
I called out for my mom,
but nothing came out.

346
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,300
Everything started spinning,
And then I was just standing there,

347
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,500
Looking down at my body.

348
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,600
And that's when you saw the man?

349
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Creepy, old guy in a black suit.

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,900
He wanted me to go with him, But...

351
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,100
...I didn't want to go.

352
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Reaper.

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,100
How'd you get rid of him?

354
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,300
I didn't.

355
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,900
The black smoke did.

356
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,600
Black smoke?

357
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,800
It was everywhere.

358
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,000
I hid in the closet,

359
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,700
And when I came out,
it was gone, and so was he.

360
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,300
Do you know
where the smoke went?

361
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,900
No.

362
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,900
But I know where it is.

363
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
They're back.

364
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Who?

365
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,400
Another reaper.

366
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,100
Hey! Hey! Wait!
We need to talk to you!

367
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Dean.

368
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,600
Do I know you?

369
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,800
We go way back.

370
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,300
You don't remember me?

371
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,100
Honestly, if I had a nickel For
every time I heard a girl say that...

372
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,000
You're gonna have to
freshen my memory.

373
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Tessa.

374
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,300
That's one of my names,
yeah.

375
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
So, you do know her.

376
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,500
From the hospital
after the accident.

377
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,600
The accident with dad?

378
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,800
So, this is the reaper
that came after you.

379
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Yeah.

380
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,700
Well, this was fun.

381
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,000
Now, if you'll excuse me --

382
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
you can't --

383
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,000
- You can't take the kid.
- Why?

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,800
Demons are in town,
that's why.

385
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,500
They've already snatched
your reaper pal.

386
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
The kid knows where.

387
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
- So?
- So, you should shag ass.

388
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
For all we know, they could try
and snatch you, too.

389
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,400
Except that this town
is off the rails,

390
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,900
And someone has to set it straight.

391
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,300
Yeah, we understand that, But

392
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,800
these are special circumstances.

393
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,400
What? Your whole
angel-Demon dance-Off?

394
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,400
I could care less.

395
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
I just want to do my job.

396
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
Right, yeah, and, look,
we want to help you do your job.

397
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
- So, if you would just bail town --
- No.

398
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,200
Well, then, could you hold off
until we fix this?

399
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Please.

400
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
All right, but just so we're clear,

401
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,300
When I start reaping again,
I'm starting with the kid.

402
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,000
Understood.

403
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
I'll find him.

404
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

405
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,400
What are you gonna say to him?

406
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,200
Whatever I have to.

407
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,200
This all must be pretty overwhelming, huh?

408
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,900
Pretty scary, too.

409
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,400
the worst is my mom.

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,600
Must be hard seeing her like this.

411
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
She's always coming in here,

412
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Talking to me,

413
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,300
telling me how sad she is.

414
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,100
I knock some stuff over
to let her know I'm here,

415
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,100
But she only gets sadder.

416
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,700
Well, you might want to ease
up On the flying soccer balls.

417
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,600
I'm not telling you where the smoke is.

418
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,900
Hey.

419
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,700
What if I told you
that if you helped me...

420
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,600
You wouldn't have to leave here -- Ever?

421
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,700
What about the one downstairs?

422
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,300
Tessa? Oh, she wouldn't bother you.

423
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
No reaper would.

424
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,300
You could just stay here with your
family For as long as you wanted.

425
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,000
You can do that?

426
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,800
Yeah, you bet I can do that.

427
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,100
You swear?

428
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,800
I swear.

429
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,600
I'll tell you,

430
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
life is funny.

431
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,200
What do you mean?

432
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,500
You and me -- Together again.

433
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,000
Are you -- Are you making a move on me?

434
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,200
You're the one that got away, dean.

435
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,300
You'd be surprised how
little that happens to me.

436
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,100
Can I tell you something
between you and me?

437
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,700
Who am I gonna tell?

438
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,300
After our little, uh, experience...

439
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,900
For that whole year,

440
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,200
I felt like I had this...

441
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,600
Hole in my gut...

442
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,400
Like I was missing something.

443
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,100
I didn't know what.

444
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Do you know what it was?

445
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,600
It was you.

446
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,600
The pain of losing my father and sammy.

447
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,000
I just...

448
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,500
I wish I had gone with you for good.

449
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,800
But I guess things are different now.

450
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,200
What?

451
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,800
The angels on your shoulder?

452
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,900
So, you know about that, huh?

453
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,500
Well, hey, don't get me wrong.

454
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,400
I mean, most the ones I've
met are dicks with wings.

455
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,900
But still...

456
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You know, I've done things.

457
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,600
Horrible things.

458
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,700
And someone upstairs Still
decided to give me a second chance.

459
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
It just makes me feel...

460
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,500
I don't know.

461
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,600
Hey, guys.

462
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,300
Hey, cole.

463
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm tessa.

464
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,800
I'm not going to hurt you.

465
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,100
It's okay, cole. Just
tell them what you told me.

466
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,200
I saw the black smoke at my funeral.

467
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,000
At the cemetery?

468
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,300
At the funeral home.

469
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,100
It was everywhere.

470
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,300
You doing that?

471
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,600
No.

472
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,300
Tessa!

473
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
Cole, you okay?

474
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,500
Well, how the hell are
we supposed to fight that?

475
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,300
I don't know. Learn some ghost moves?

476
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,900
By tonight?

477
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,100
Yeah, sure. I'll meet
you back at mr. Miyagi's.

478
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,900
Who's mr. Miyagi?

479
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
It's not gonna move if
you don't concentrate.

480
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,000
I am concentrating.

481
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,000
Ah, here we go, baby.

482
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,400
You pull a muscle?

483
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,000
All right, yoda, let's see what you got.

484
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,000
Dude!

485
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,700
You are so amityville.

486
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,900
This isn't even the good stuff.

487
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,400
See? If you want to hit something,
You just got to get mad.

488
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, got it.

489
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,100
Now you try. Hit me.

490
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,000
Uh, I think I'll stick To just
picking on somebody my own size.

491
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,900
Hit me as hard as you can.

492
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,800
Dude, I'm not gonna do "fight
club" with a 12-Year-Old.

493
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
All right, cut it out.

494
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,600
Make me.

495
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,800
Whoa. Whoa, you got to teach us that.

496
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
This looks like "new jack city."

497
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,300
Can nobody can see this?

498
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,100
Maybe it's demon invisible ink --
Only see it in the veil.

499
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,900
Any idea what it's for?

500
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
We'll find out.

501
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Dude, check me out.

502
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,800
You know, this ghost thing -- It's --

503
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
It's kind of rad.

504
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,300
It's iron.

505
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,100
Boys...

506
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,900
...find the place okay?

507
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,300
Rock salt's not so much fun anymore, is it?

508
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,100
Alastair...

509
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,500
You bastard.

510
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,300
Well, go on.

511
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,900
Why don't you try some of
your mojo on me now, hotshot?

512
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,300
It's hard to get it up When
you're not wearing your meat, huh?

513
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,500
Go to hell.

514
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,700
Ah, if only I could,

515
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,100
But they just keep sending me
Back up to this arctic craphole.

516
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,000
To kill death?

517
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,800
No, to kill death twice.
It takes two to break a seal.

518
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,500
I figured another one
would show up, though.

519
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,300
They're like lemmings.

520
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,500
By the way,

521
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,100
it's, uh, good to see you again, dean.

522
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,500
You can shoot us all you want,
but you can't kill us.

523
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,300
Ah, that so?

524
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,900
Anyhoo...

525
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,500
Moon's in the right spot.

526
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,800
The board is set.

527
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,900
Let's get started,
shall we?

528
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
You're gonna kill
a reaper with that?

529
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,000
It's little on the nose,
don't you think?

530
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,400
Is it?

531
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,300
An old friend lent it to me.

532
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,900
You know, he doesn't really
ride a pale horse,

533
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,900
But he does have
three amigos.

534
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,600
And they're just jonesing
for the apocalypse.

535
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,000
??? Pays to have friends
in low places,

536
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,800
Don't you think?

537
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,800
<i>Hic cruor messorius,</i>

538
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,200
<i>Illud sigillum,</i>

539

<i>Quod luciferem

540
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,000
<i>Aperiat ut resurgat!</i>

541
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,100
No!

542
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,500
Stop!

543
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,900
<i>hic cruor messorius...</i>

544
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,300
I know you're here.

545
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,600
What's the matter,
you reeking son of a bitch?

546
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,600
You afraid of a skirt?

547
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,100
<i>Vis, vis --</i>

548
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,700
Ah!

549
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,500
Ah! Son of a bitch!

550
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,900
<i>...illud sigillum,</i>

551
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,800
<i>Quod luciferem

552
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,700
<i>Aperiat ut resurgat!</i>

553
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,100
Bye-Bye.

554
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,000
Where's your brother?

555
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,000
I'll go find him.
You get out of here.

556
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
<i>Animum vult decipi, ergo...</i>

557
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Pamela!

558
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Aah!

559
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,300
What's so funny?

560
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,100
I can't die --

561
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,800
Not in this town.

562
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,800
Look.

563
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,400
Pamela --

564
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,300
Quit your worrying, grumpy.

565
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,700
How about
you make me a drink, huh?

566
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,400
You need a doctor.

567
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,000
Make me a drink, Sam.

568
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,300
You can't run...dean.

569
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,500
Not from me.

570
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm inside that angst-Y,
little noggin of yours.

571
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,000
What the hell?

572
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,000
Guess again.

573
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,400
what ???

574
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,000
You and Sam
just saved a seal.

575
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,000
We captured alastair.

576
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,900
Dean, this was a victory.

577
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,100
Well, no thanks to you.

578
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,600
What makes you say that?

579
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,000
You were here the whole time?

580
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,000
Enough of it.

581
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,100
Well, thanks for your help
with the rock salt.

582
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,300
That script on the funeral home --
We couldn't penetrate it.

583
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,100
That was angel-Proofing?

584
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,200
Why do you think I recruited you
and Sam in the first place?

585
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,800
<i>You recruited us?</i>

586
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,300
That wasn't your friend bobby
who called, dean.

587
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,200
It wasn't bobby
who told Sam about the seal.

588
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,600
That was you?

589
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,300
If you want our help,
Why the hell didn't you just ask?

590
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,100
Because whatever I ask,

591
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
You seem to do
the exact opposite.

592
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,300
So, what now, huh? The people in this town,
They just gonna start dying again?

593
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,600
Yes.

594
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
These are good people.

595
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,000
What, you think you can
make a few exceptions?

596
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,100
To everything
there is a season.

597
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,400
You made an exception for me.

598
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,600
You're different.

599
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,400
Dean?

600
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,800
I could use your help.

601
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,300
Hey, cole.

602
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Tell your brother
thanks for nothing.

603
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,200
Look at her, cole.

604
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,800
Do you see how unhappy she is?

605
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,600
That's why I want
to stay with her.

606
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
As long as
she can feel you,

607
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,100
She'll be in pain,

608
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,800
Because she can't let go,

609
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,000
<i>Because you won't
let go of her.</i>

610
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,600
Why won't anybody tell me
what's on the other side?

611
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,900
Maybe nobody wants
to ruin the surprise.

612
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,600
That's not an answer.

613
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,300
she won't answer you, cole.

614
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,800
Reapers never do.

615
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,300
But trust me...

616
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,200
Staying here is a whole lot worse
Than anything over there.

617
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,100
Why?

618
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,300
Because one day,
your family will be gone,

619
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,400
And there will be
nothing left here for you.

620
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,800
It's okay to be scared.

621
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm not scared.

622
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,800
<i>We're all scared.</i>

623
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,400
That's the big secret.

624
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,200
<i>We're all scared.</i>

625
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,200
Are you coming?

626
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,300
Oh, I'm sure I'll be there
sooner than you think.

627
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,900
Look out for that boy.

628
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,600
Look out for yourself, Dean.

629
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,500
What do you mean?

630
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,600
I've been around death

631
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,000
from the get-Go.

632
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,400
You know what I see most?

633
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,400
Lies.

634
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,200
"He's in a better place."

635
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,200
"At least they're together now."

636
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,800
You all lie to yourselves, Dean,

637
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,100
'Cause like you said,

638
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,600
Deep down,
you're all scared.

639
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,900
Stop lying to yourself, Dean.

640
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,000
What?

641
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,500
The angels have something good
in store for you...

642
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,400
A second chance.

643
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,000
Really?

644
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,600
'Cause I'm pretty sure...

645
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,600
Deep down...

646
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,200
You know something nasty's
coming down the road.

647
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,100
Trust your instincts, Dean.

648
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,800
There's no such thing
as miracles.

649
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,800
What are you saying?

650
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,800
<i>Imum vult decipi,
ergo decipiatur.</i>

651
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,700
<i>Vis, vis, vis.</i>

652
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,300
Hey,

653
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,300
we just got to talk
to tessa, that's all --

654
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,100
Get her to hold off reaping
till we get you better.

655
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,900
I'm pretty sure
she's started up again.

656
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,600
What happened?

657
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,600
Dean, where's tessa?

658
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,500
She's...

659
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,000
Pamela,

660
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
I'm so sorry.

661
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,900
- Stop.
- You don't deserve this.

662
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,100
Yeah, I don't.

663
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,400
I told you I didn't want
anything to do with this.

664
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,600
Do me a favor?

665
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,300
Tell that bastard bobby singer

666
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,100
to go to hell For ever introducing me
to you two in the first place.

667
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Take it easy, pamela.

668
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,700
If it's any consolation,
you're going to a better place.

669
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
You're lying.

670
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
But what the hell, right?

671
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,400
Everybody's got to go sometime.

672
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,300
Come here.

673
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,700
I know what you did
to that demon, Sam.

674
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,800
I can feel
what's inside of you.

675
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,500
If you think
you have good intentions,

676
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,300
Think again.

677
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,100
Pamela?

678
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,500
Pamela!

679
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,500
What did she say to you?
