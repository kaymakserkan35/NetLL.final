1
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:04,062
Something turned him
into a monster.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,964
- What are we dealing with? do you know?
- Croatoan.

3
00:00:06,032 --> 00:00:07,633
- A demonic virus?
- More like, demonic germ warfare.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,935
What if we all have it?
what if we all go crazy?

5
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:14,472
Back in 1835, Samuel Colt made a gun.

6
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,474
They say this gun
can kill anything.

7
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:18,443
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

8
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:21,413
You need my consent. Michael needs
my say-so to ride around in my skin.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,048
Unfortunately, yes.

10
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:24,182
The answer's no.

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,351
- You know who I am?
- Lucifer.

12
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:27,786
You're the one, Sam.

13
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,021
You're my vessel.

14
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:30,589
That'll never happen.

15
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,591
- I know you don't trust me.
- So, what are you saying?

16
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,026
That I'm dangerous.

17
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:36,461
Maybe it's best we just
go our separate ways.

18
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:44,369
Hi, good evening, brother.
Is your soul rapture-ready?

19
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:46,672
Thank you, sir, god bless.

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,640
Good evening, folks.
is your soul rapture-ready?

21
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,542
Because what I'd like to
do is just show you

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,944
Exactly what god's love is for you.

23
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,979
Okay, god bless.

24
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,514
Excuse me, friend, but
have you taken time out

25
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,283
To think about god's plan for you?

26
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,588
Too friggin' much, pal.

27
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:09,227
We're talking about the colt, right?

28
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:10,762
I mean, as in the colt?

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,930
We are.

30
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:13,298
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

31
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,033
I mean, why would the demons
keep a gun around

32
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:17,102
that uh, kills demons?

33
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,537
What? what did...

34
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:22,207
I didn't... I didn't get that.

35
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:23,541


36
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,910
You know, it's kind of funny,

37
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:26,845
Talking to a messenger of
god on a cellphone.

38
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:29,581
It's, you know, like watching
a hells angel ride a mo-ped.

39
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,149
This isn't funny, Dean.

40
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,684
The voice says I'm almost out of minutes.

41
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:33,752
Okay, all right.

42
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,187
I'm... I'm telling you, Cass,

43
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:38,090
The mooks have melted
down the gun by now.

44
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:39,357
Well, I hear differently.

45
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,860
And if it's true and if you are still set

46
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:44,930
on the insane task of killing the devil,

47
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:46,098
This is how we do it.

48
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:47,165
Okay. Where do we start?

49
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,834
Where are you now?

50
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,036
Kansas city.

51
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,971


52
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,506
Century, hotel room 113.

53
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,274
I'll be there immediately.

54
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:58,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
no, no, come on, man.

55
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:01,346
I just drove like 16
hours straight, okay?

56
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,413
I'm human.

57
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:03,615
And there's stuff I got to do.

58
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:04,783
What stuff?

59
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,952
Eat, for example.
in this case, sleep.

60
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,887
I just need like four hours
once in a while, okay?

61
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:10,122
Yes.

62
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,457
Okay, so, you can pop in
tomorrow morning.

63
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,026
Yes.

64
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,426
I'll just...

65
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,299
...wait here, then.

66
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,572


67
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,176


68
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:36,048
Damn it, Cass, I need to sleep!

69
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,850
Dean, it's me.

70
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,385
Sam?

71
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:43,755
It's quarter past 4:00.

72
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:45,523
This is important.

73
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:49,561
So, you're his vessel, huh?

74
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,964
Lucifer's wearing you to the prom?

75
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:55,100
That's what he said.

76
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:56,802
Just when you thought you were out,

77
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,603
they pull you back in huh, Sammy?

78
00:02:58,671 --> 00:02:59,571
So, that's it?

79
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,972
that's your response?

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,808
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

81
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,142
A-a little panic, maybe?

82
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,510
I guess, I'm a little numb

83
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:08,113
to the earth-shattering
revelations at this point.

84
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:10,415
What are we gonna do about it?

85
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,684
What do you want
to do about it?

86
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,485
I want back in, for starters.

87
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:15,854
- Sam...
- I mean it.

88
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:18,556
I am sick of being a puppet
to these sons of bitches.

89
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,458
I'm gonna hunt him down, Dean.

90
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,427
Oh, so, we're back to
revenge then, are we?

91
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,196
Yeah, 'cause that worked out
so well last time.

92
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:26,598
Not revenge,

93
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,166
redemption.

94
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:29,634
So, what, you're just
gonna walk back in

95
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:31,136
And we're gonna be
the dynamic duo again?

96
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:32,270
Look, Dean, I can do this.

97
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:35,040
I can. I'm gonna prove it to you.

98
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,746
Look, Sam...

99
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,981
It doesn't matter...

100
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,783
whatever we do.

101
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,554
I mean, it turns out that
you and me, we're the uh...

102
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:51,322
The fire and the oil
of the Armageddon.

103
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,291
You know, on that basis alone,

104
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:56,327
we should just pick a hemisphere...

105
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:57,996
Stay away from each other for good.

106
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:59,798
Dean, it does not
have to be like this.

107
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,767
- We can fight it.
- Yeah, you're right, we can.

108
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:04,736
But not together,

109
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:09,440
we're not stronger
when we're together, Sam.

110
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:12,144
I think we're weaker.

111
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,980
Because whatever we have between us...

112
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,415
Love, family, whatever it is...

113
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:21,086
they are always, gonna use it against us,

114
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:23,121
and you know that.

115
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:31,263
We're better off apart.

116
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,365
We got a better chance
of dodging, Lucifer and Michael

117
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:37,735
and this whole damn thing...

118
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:39,838
If we just go our own ways.

119
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,639
Dean, don't do this.

120
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:46,144
Bye, Sam.

121
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:38,196
Season 5 Episode 4

122
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:45,563
Little girl?
Little girl.

123
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,600
Are you hurt?

124
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:55,773
You know the not-talking thing
is kind of creepy, right?

125
00:06:58,945 --> 00:06:59,911


126
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:05,450


127
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,092
Oh, crap.

128
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:51,162


129
00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:56,468
# do you love me #

130
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,269
# I can really move #

131
00:07:58,337 --> 00:08:00,005
# do you love me #

132
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,606
# I'm in the groove #

133
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,308
# do you love me #

134
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:05,276
# do you love me #

135
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:13,284
# now that I can da-a-a-nce #

136
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:14,519
# watch me, now, hey #

137
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:15,620
# work, work #

138
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,493


139
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:38,276
"August 1st, 2014."

140
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,519


141
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:58,629


142
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:00,898
That's never a good sign.

143
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:08,873
"Croatoan pandemic reaches, Australia."

144
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,375
I thought I smelled your stink

145
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:11,943
on this "back to the future" crap.

146
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,645
"president, Palin defends bombing of Houston."

147
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:16,781
Certainly a buyer's market in real estate.

148
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,016
Let's see what's happening in sports,

149
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,785
that's right... no more sports.

150
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,788
Congress revoked the right
to group assembly.

151
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,123
what's left of congress, that is.

152
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,457
- Hardly a quorum, if you ask me.
- How did you find me?

153
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,492


154
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,695
Afraid we had to tap some
unorthodox resources of late...

155
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:31,862
Human informants.

156
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,998
We've been making
inspirational visits

157
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,967
to the fringier Christian groups.

158
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,669
They've been given your image,
told to keep an eye out.

159
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,572
The bible freak outside the motel...

160
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,240
He, what, dropped a dime on me?

161
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:43,674
Onward, Christian soldiers.

162
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:45,910
Okay, well, good, great.
you have had your jollies.

163
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,712
Now send me back,
you son of a bitch.

164
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,615
Oh, you'll get back...
all in good time.

165
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:52,917
We want you to marinate a bit.

166
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:53,918
Marinate?

167
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:55,920
Three days, Dean.

168
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:58,055
Three days to see where
this course of action takes you.

169
00:09:58,124 --> 00:09:59,624
What's that supposed to mean?

170
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,560
It means that your choices
have consequences.

171
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:03,561


172
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,531
This is what happens to the world

173
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,998
If you continue to
say "no" to Michael.

174
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,737
Have a little look-see.

175
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,151
Bobby?

176
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,921
Bobby, I'm coming in!

177
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,521
Oh no.

178
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,957
Where is everybody, Bobby?

179
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:21,872
"camp Chit-aqua."

180
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,667
Oh, baby, no.

181
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:03,999
Ohh no baby, what
did they do to you?

182
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:31,585
What the hell?

183
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:34,821
I should be asking that
question, don't you think?

184
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,891
In fact, why don't you
give me one good reason

185
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,726
Why I shouldn't gank you
right here and now?

186
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,630
Because you'd only
be hurting yourself.

187
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:44,831
That's very funny.

188
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:47,569
Look, man...

189
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:52,840
I'm no shape-shifter or
demon or anything, okay?

190
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:56,077
Yeah, I know. I did the drill
while you were out.

191
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:59,914
Silver, salt, holy water... nothing.

192
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:02,083
But you know
what was funny...

193
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:03,384
Was that you had

194
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,586
Every hidden lock-pick,
box cutter, and switchblade

195
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:06,688
that I carry.

196
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:09,590
Now, you want
to explain that?

197
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:13,194
Oh, and the, uh... resemblance,
while you're at it?

198
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,463
Zachariah.

199
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:20,669
Come again?

200
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:23,105
I'm you, from the tail end of 2009.

201
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,773
Zach plucked me from my bed

202
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:27,910
And threw me five
years into the future.

203
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,244
Where is he?
I want to talk to him.

204
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:30,746
I don't know.

205
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,647
- Oh, you don't know.
- No, I don't know.

206
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:35,650
Look, I just want to get back
to my own friggin' year, okay?

207
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:39,021
Okay.

208
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:44,392
If you're me...

209
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,696
Then tell me something
only I would know.

210
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:49,765


211
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:57,472
Rhonda Hurley.

212
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,743
We were, uh... 19.

213
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,847
She made us try on her panties.

214
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:07,049
They were pink

215
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:08,717
and satiny,

216
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:11,053
and you know what?

217
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,420
We kind of liked it.

218
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:16,591
Touché?

219
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,934
So, what... Zach zapped you
up here to see how bad it gets?

220
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:26,935
I guess.

221
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:28,971


222
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:32,174
Croatoan virus, right?
that's their endgame?

223
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:34,409
It's efficient, it's incurable,

224
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,178
And it's scary as hell.

225
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:38,413
Turns people into monsters.

226
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,616
Started hitting the major cities
about two years ago.

227
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:43,551
World really went
in the crapper after that.

228
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,120


229
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,121
What about, Sam?

230
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,464
Heavy-weight showdown in Detroit,

231
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,869
from what I understand,
Sam didn't make it.

232
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
You weren't with him?

233
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:06,608
No.

234
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,048
No, me and Sam,
we hadn't talked in...

235
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:15,383
Hell, five years.

236
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:20,789
We never tried to find him?

237
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:24,693
I got other people
to worry about.

238
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,694
Where you going?

239
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:27,996
I got to run an errand.

240
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:29,564
Whoa, you're just
gonna leave me here?

241
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:30,933
Yes.

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,335
I got a camp full of twitchy
trauma survivors out there

243
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:35,270
With an apocalypse
hanging over their head.

244
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,739
The last thing they need to see
is a version of "the parent trap."

245
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:40,475
So, yeah, you stay locked down.

246
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,743
Okay, all right, fine.

247
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,978
But you don't have to cuff me, man.

248
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:48,283
Oh, come on. you
don't trust yourself?

249
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:51,019
No.

250
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:52,454
Absolutely not.

251
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:59,161
Dick.

252
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:00,896


253
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,335


254
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,470


255
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:13,208


256
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:25,053
Hey, Dean. you got a second?

257
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:29,224
No. yes.
uh... I-I guess.

258
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,225
Hi, Chuck.

259
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,659
Hi.

260
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:33,395
So, uh, listen, we're pretty
good on canned goods for now,

261
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:35,030
But we're down
to next to nothing

262
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:37,099
On perishables and...
and hygiene supplies.

263
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,801
People are not gonna
be happy about this.

264
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,037
So, what do you
think we should do?

265
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:44,706
I-I don't know.

266
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,576
Maybe, uh, share?

267
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:49,912
You know, like at a kibbutz.

268
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:54,283
Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed
to be out on a mission right now?

269
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,850
Absolutely and I will be.

270
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,152
Uh-oh.

271
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,787
Whoa! geez!

272
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:00,088
Easy, lady!

273
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:01,689
- Risa.
- Risa.

274
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:03,425
You spent the night in, Jane's
cabin last night, didn't you?

275
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:06,761
Uh, what? I-I don't... did I?

276
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,797
I thought we had a "connection."

277
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:10,865
Well, I'm sure that we do.

278
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,100
Yeah?

279
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,069
- Hi, Risa.
- Screw you.

280
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,340
Oh, geez. I'm getting busted for
stuff I haven't even done yet.

281
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:19,541
What?

282
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,944
Uh, never mind.

283
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:25,580
Hey, Chuck, is... Cass still here?

284
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:26,982
Yeah.

285
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,351
I don't think, Cass is going anywhere.

286
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:42,164
So, in this way,

287
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:46,969
We're each a fragment
of total perception...

288
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:50,305
Just, uh, one compartment

289
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:55,643
In that dragonfly eye
of group mind.

290
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,648
Now, the key to this
total, shared perception...

291
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:04,886
It's, um... it's surprisingly physical.

292
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,488
Oh.

293
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:08,323
Excuse me, ladies.

294
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,692
I think I need to confer with
our fearless leader for a minute.

295
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,961
Why not go get
washed up for the orgy?

296
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,967
You're all so beautiful.

297
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:23,671


298
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,611
What are you, a hippie?

299
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:33,348
I thought you'd gotten
over trying to label me.

300
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,083


301
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,751
- Cass, we got to talk.
- Whoa, strange.

302
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:37,986
What?

303
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:41,490
You... are not you...
not "now" you, anyway.

304
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,958
No! yeah, yes exactly.

305
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:45,293
What year are you from?

306
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,495
2009.

307
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:47,862


308
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,964
Who did this to you? is it, Zachariah?

309
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:50,832
Yes.

310
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,067


311
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:53,435
Interesting.

312
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,504
Oh, yeah, it's friggin' fascinating.

313
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:57,605
Now why don't you
strap on your angel wings

314
00:18:57,673 --> 00:19:00,342
And fly me back
to my page on the calendar?

315
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,011


316
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:06,714
I wish I could just,
uh, strap on my wings,

317
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,716
But I'm sorry... no dice.

318
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,785


319
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,120
What, are you stoned?

320
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:15,457
Uh... generally, yeah.

321
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:19,361
What happened to you?

322
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:21,963
Life.

323
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,357


324
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:51,193
Hey. hey! watch out!

325
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,427


326
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:03,738
Damn it.

327
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:07,075
I'm not gonna lie to you.

328
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:08,477
Me and him...

329
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:10,812
It's a pretty messed-up
situation we got going.

330
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,147
But believe me,

331
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:15,250
When you need to know
something, you will know it.

332
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:18,286
Until then, we all have work to do.

333
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,460
What the hell was that?

334
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,229
what the hell was that?

335
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,331
You just shot a guy in cold blood.

336
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:31,899
We were in an open quarantine zone...

337
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,769
Got ambushed by some,
Crotes on the way out.

338
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:35,970
Crotes... Croatoans.

339
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,905
One of them infected, Yager.

340
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:39,874
How do you know?

341
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:42,244
'cause after a few years of this, I know.

342
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:45,213
I started seeing symptoms
about a half an hour ago.

343
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:47,115
Wasn't gonna be long
before he flipped.

344
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:49,017
I didn't see the point

345
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:50,785
In troubling a good
man with bad news.

346
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:52,086
"troubling a good man"?

347
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:53,655
You just blew him away
in front of your own people.

348
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:55,257
Don't you think that
freaked them out a little bit?

349
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:56,791
It's 2014.

350
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:00,562
Plugging some crote...
it's called commonplace.

351
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,864
Trading words with my friggin' clone...

352
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:04,899
that might have freaked them out a little.

353
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,034
All right, look...

354
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:07,235
No, you look.

355
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:09,404
this isn't your time. It's mine.

356
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:11,005
you don't make the decisions, I do.

357
00:21:11,073 --> 00:21:14,176
So, when I say stay in, you stay in.

358
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:22,083
All right, man. I'm sorry.

359
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:26,688
Look, I-I'm not trying to
mess you or... me...

360
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:28,022
Us up here.

361
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,923
I know.

362
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:33,961
It's just been a really wacky weekend.

363
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,763
Tell me about it.

364
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:46,974
What was the mission, anyway?

365
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:58,386
The colt?

366
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:02,023
The colt.

367
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:05,327
Where was it?

368
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:08,096
Everywhere.

369
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:10,031
They've been moving it around,

370
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:14,669
took me five years, but...

371
00:22:14,737 --> 00:22:15,903
I finally got it.

372
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:18,473
and tonight...

373
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:21,543
...tonight, I'm gonna kill the devil.

374
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:36,151
So, that's it? that's the colt?

375
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,388
If anything can kill, Lucifer, this is it.

376
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:41,657
Great.

377
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:44,693
have we got anything
that can find, Lucifer?

378
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:45,961
Are you okay?

379
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,897
Oh, we were in, uh,
Jane's cabin last night.

380
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:53,869
And, apparently, we and...
Risa have a connection.

381
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,676
You want to shut up?

382
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:03,278
we don't have to find,
Lucifer, we know where he is.

383
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,346
The demon that we caught last week...

384
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:08,349
he was one of the...
big guy's entourage.

385
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:09,585
He knew.

386
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:11,453
So, a demon tells you
where Satan's gonna be,

387
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,188
and you just believe it?

388
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:15,457
Oh, trust me... he wasn't lying.

389
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:16,959
and you know this how?

390
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:19,061
Our fearless leader, I'm afraid,

391
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:22,430
Is all too well schooled in
the art of getting to the truth.

392
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,666
Torture?

393
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:31,907
Oh, so, we're... we're torturing again.

394
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:34,876
No, that's... that's good, classy.

395
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:36,578


396
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:40,348
What? I like "past you."

397
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,285
Lucifer is here.

398
00:23:44,353 --> 00:23:47,656
Now, I know the block
and I know the building.

399
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:50,525
Oh good, it's right
in the middle of a hot zone.

400
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:53,294
Crawling with crotes, yeah.
You saying my plan is reckless?

401
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,563
Are you saying we, uh, walk in
straight up the driveway,

402
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:57,099
Past all the demons and the crotes,

403
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,533
- and we shoot the devil?
- yes.

404
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:01,069
Okay, if you don't like,
uh, "reckless,"

405
00:24:01,137 --> 00:24:03,071
I could use "insouciant," maybe.

406
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:03,972
Are you coming?

407
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:07,142
Of course.

408
00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:09,011
but why is he? I mean,
he's you five years ago.

409
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:10,912
If something happens to him,
you're gone, right?

410
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,947
He's coming.

411
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,915
Okay.

412
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:17,119
Well, uh... I'll get the grunts moving.

413
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:18,920
We're loaded and on
the road by midnight.

414
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:20,455
All righty.

415
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:22,223


416
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:25,093
Why are you taking me?

417
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:28,363
Relax, you'll be fine.

418
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,831
Zach's looking after you, right?

419
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,468
No, that's not what I mean.

420
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:37,139
I want to know what's going on.

421
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:42,878
Yeah, okay.

422
00:24:47,684 --> 00:24:49,751
You're coming because I
want you to see something.

423
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:53,521
I want you to see our brother.

424
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:56,124
Sam?

425
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,794
I thought he was dead.

426
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,665
Sam didn't die in Detroit.

427
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:06,802
He said "yes."

428
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:08,536
"yes"?

429
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:14,943
Wait.

430
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,080
You mean...

431
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:19,114
That's right.

432
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:21,382
The big "yes."

433
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,618
To the devil.

434
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:25,721
Lucifer's wearing him to the prom.

435
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,694
Why would he do that?

436
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:34,429
Wish I knew.

437
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,866
But now we don't have a choice.

438
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:41,069
It's in him, and it's not getting out.

439
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:44,972
And we've got to kill him, Dean.

440
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:51,379
And you need to see it...

441
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:53,481
The whole damn thing,
how bad it gets...

442
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:54,649
so you can do it different.

443
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:55,984
What do you mean?

444
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:58,386
Zach said he was gonna
bring you back, right? to '09?

445
00:25:58,454 --> 00:25:59,554
Yeah.

446
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:02,791
Well, when you get back home...

447
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:05,260
You say "yes."

448
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:07,695
You hear me? say "yes" to, Michael.

449
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:09,530
That's crazy.

450
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:11,499
If I let him in, then Michael fights the devil.

451
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,401
The battle's gonna torch half the planet.

452
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:16,238
Look around you, man.

453
00:26:16,305 --> 00:26:17,705
half the planet's better than no planet,

454
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:19,975
Which is what we have now.

455
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:22,744
If I could do it over again,
I'd say "yes" in a heartbeat.

456
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:24,913
- So why don't you?
- I've tried!

457
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:27,182
I've shouted "yes"
till I was blue in the face!

458
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,616
The angels aren't listening!

459
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:30,886
They just... left... gave up!

460
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:32,553
it's too late for me, but for you

461
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:34,289
Oh, no. there's got
to be another way.

462
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:37,092
Yeah, that's what I thought.

463
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,460
I was cocky.

464
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:41,429
Never actually thought I'd lose.

465
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,533
But I was wrong.

466
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:48,536
Dean...

467
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:50,405
I was wrong.

468
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:55,443
I'm begging you.

469
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:57,279
Say "yes."

470
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,323
But you won't.

471
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:11,726
'cause I didn't.

472
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,799
Because that's just not us, is it?

473
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:23,738


474
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:29,344
So, you're really from '09?

475
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:30,745
Yeah, afraid so.

476
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:32,180
Some free advice?

477
00:27:32,248 --> 00:27:35,917
You ever get back there,
you hoard toilet paper.

478
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:37,319
You understand me? hoard it.

479
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,786
Hoard it like it's made of gold.

480
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:39,955
'cause it is.

481
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,489
Thank you, Chuck.

482
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:44,192
Oh, you'll thank me,
all right. mark my words.

483
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,626
I'll see you around.

484
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:46,794
Yeah.

485
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:48,529
Okay.

486
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:50,932


487
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:03,311


488
00:28:06,515 --> 00:28:07,983
Let me see those.

489
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,051
You want some?

490
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,686


491
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:13,521
Amphetamines?

492
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:16,858
It's the perfect antidote to that absinthe.

493
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:18,360


494
00:28:18,427 --> 00:28:19,460
Mmm.

495
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:20,795
Don't get me wrong, Cass.

496
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,630
I, uh...

497
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:26,334
I'm happy that the stick
is out of your ass, but...

498
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:28,870
What's going on...
w-with the drugs

499
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:30,972
And the orgies and the love-guru crap?

500
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,707


501
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:34,575
What's so funny?

502
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:36,344
Dean, I'm not an angel anymore.

503
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:37,712
What?

504
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,980
Yeah, I went mortal.

505
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:40,848
What do you mean? how?

506
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:43,051
I think it had something to do
with the other angels leaving,

507
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,487
But when they bailed,
my mojo just kind of...

508
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:49,391
Shhrr!... drained away.

509
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:52,693
And now, you know,
I'm practically human.

510
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:54,462
I mean, Dean I'm all but useless.

511
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,698
Last year, broke my foot...
laid up for two months.

512
00:28:57,766 --> 00:28:58,766
- Wow.
- Yeah.

513
00:28:58,834 --> 00:28:59,935
So, you're human.

514
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,572
Well, welcome to the club.

515
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,641
Thanks.

516
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:09,978
Except I used to belong
to a much better club.

517
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:12,147
And now I'm powerless...

518
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:14,316
I'm hapless, I'm hopeless.

519
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:17,652
I mean, why the hell
not bury myself

520
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,654
In women and decadence, right?

521
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:22,890
It's the end, baby. that's
what decadence is for.

522
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,826
Why not bang a few gongs
before the lights go out?

523
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:29,530
But, then...

524
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:31,566
That's just how I roll.

525
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:56,724
There, second-floor window.

526
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,026
We go in there.

527
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:00,861
You sure about this?

528
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:02,729
They'll never see us coming.

529
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,333
Trust me.

530
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,935
Now, weapons check.
we're on the move in five.

531
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:11,638
Hey, uh... me.

532
00:30:11,706 --> 00:30:13,007
Can I talk to you for a sec?

533
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:18,345


534
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:21,781
Tell me what's going on.

535
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:22,816
What?

536
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:23,984
I know you.

537
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:28,122
You're lying to these people and to me.

538
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:29,256
Is that so?

539
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:30,424
Yeah.

540
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:32,592
See, I know your lying expressions.

541
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,161
I've seen them in the mirror.

542
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:37,164
Now, there's something
you're not telling us.

543
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:38,532
I don't know what
you're talking about.

544
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,367
Oh, really?

545
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:42,503
Well, I don't seem to be the only member
of your posse with some questions,

546
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,205
So, uh, maybe I'll just
take my doubts over to them.

547
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:47,774
Okay, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. wait.

548
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:48,909
What?

549
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:50,710
Take a look around you, man.

550
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:53,347
This place should be
white-hot with crotes.

551
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:54,648
Where are they?

552
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:59,853
They cleared a path for us.

553
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:01,055
Which means
that this is...

554
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:02,256
A trap... exactly.

555
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:04,058
Well, then we can't go
through the front.

556
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,592
oh, we're not.

557
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,660
they are.

558
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:09,596
They're the decoys.

559
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:11,498
You and me... we're going
in through the back.

560
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:16,303
You mean you're gonna
feed your friends

561
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:18,004
into a meat grinder?

562
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:19,073
Cass, too?

563
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:23,377
You want to use their
deaths as a diversion?

564
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,481
Oh, man, something
is broken in you.

565
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:29,716
you're making decisions
that I would never make.

566
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:31,918
I wouldn't sacrifice my friends.

567
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,954
you're right, you wouldn't.

568
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:36,490
It's one of the main reasons
we're in this mess, actually.

569
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:41,195
These people count,
on you they trust you.

570
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:44,531
They trust me to kill the devil
and to save the world,

571
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,032
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

572
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:48,001
No. Not like this, you're not.
I'm not gonna let you.

573
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:49,669
Oh, really?

574
00:31:49,737 --> 00:31:50,437
Yeah.

575
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,774


576
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:57,811


577
00:31:57,878 --> 00:31:59,946


578
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,261


579
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,933


580
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:25,906
Oh.

581
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:29,276
Hello, Dean.

582
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:36,972
Aren't you a surprise.

583
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,807


584
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,109
You've come a long way
to see this, haven't you?

585
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:49,551
Well, go ahead.

586
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:50,619
Kill me.

587
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,087
Kill you?

588
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:59,194
Don't you think that would be
a little... redundant?

589
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,931


590
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,133
I'm sorry.

591
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:07,002
It must be painful...

592
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,973
Speaking to me in this... shape.

593
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,908
but it had to be your brother.

594
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:13,976
It had to be.

595
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:22,283
You don't have to be
afraid of me, Dean.

596
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:23,819
What do you think
I'm going to do?

597
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:29,390
I don't know, maybe deep-fry the planet?

598
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:33,629
Why?

599
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,432
Why would I want to
destroy this stunning thing...

600
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,837
Beautiful, in a trillion different ways...

601
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:45,007
the last perfect handiwork of god?

602
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,280
You ever hear the story
of how I fell from grace?

603
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:54,750
Oh, good god. you're not gonna
tell me a bedtime story, are you?

604
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:57,853
My stomach's almost out of bile.

605
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,721
You know why
god cast me down?

606
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:05,927
Because I loved him,

607
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:07,195
more than anything

608
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:10,532
and then god created...

609
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:14,302


610
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,270
...you.

611
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:20,776
The little...

612
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:22,944
hairless apes.

613
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:27,115
and then he asked all of us
to bow down before you...

614
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:30,118
to love you more than him.

615
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:34,923
and I said, "father...

616
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,292
I can't."

617
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,130
I said, "these human beings
are flawed, murderous."

618
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:46,902
and for that...

619
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:52,040
God had, Michael cast me into hell.

620
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:54,810
Now, tell me...

621
00:34:54,877 --> 00:34:58,479
Does the punishment fit the crime?

622
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:00,448
Especially when I was right?

623
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:06,621
Look at what 6 billion of you
have done to this thing.

624
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,990
and how many of
you blame me for it?

625
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:15,831
You're not fooling me
you know that?

626
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:20,102
With this sympathy-for-the-devil crap.

627
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:21,870
I know what you are.

628
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,705
What am I?

629
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,807
You're the same thing, only bigger.

630
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,776
The same brand of cockroach

631
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:30,045
I've been squashing my whole life,

632
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:34,950
an ugly, evil, belly-to-the-ground,

633
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:37,385
supernatural piece of crap.

634
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:42,124
The only difference
between them and you

635
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:44,492
Is the size of your ego.

636
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:55,336
I like you, Dean.

637
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:58,740
I get what the other angels see in you.

638
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:02,410
Goodbye.

639
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:04,345
We'll meet again soon.

640
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:08,583
You better kill me now!

641
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:12,687
Pardon?

642
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,823
You better kill me now.

643
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:18,626
Or I swear, I will find
a way to kill you.

644
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:21,129
and I won't stop.

645
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:23,364
I know you won't.

646
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:27,202
I know you won't say "yes"
to, Michael either.

647
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,104
and I know you won't kill Sam.

648
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:32,274
Whatever you do...

649
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:36,678
You will always end up here.

650
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:41,516
Whatever choices you make,
whatever details you alter,

651
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,919
we will always end up...

652
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:47,723
...here.

653
00:36:50,026 --> 00:36:53,429
I win.

654
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:55,130
So, I win.

655
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:59,335
You're wrong.

656
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:03,905
See you in five years, Dean.

657
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,475


658
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,221
Oh, well, if it isn't the, ghost
of Christmas "screw you."

659
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,589
Enough.

660
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:30,324
Dean, enough.

661
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:33,994
You saw it, right?
you saw what happens.

662
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:36,397
You're the only person
who can prove the devil wrong.

663
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:39,866
Just say "yes."

664
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:42,236
How do I know that this whole
thing isn't one of your tricks?

665
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,338
Huh? some angel hocus-pocus?

666
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:45,805
The time for tricks is over.

667
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:49,243
Give yourself to, Michael.

668
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,313
Say "yes," and we can strike.

669
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:55,949
Before, Lucifer gets to, Sam.

670
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:57,484
Before billions die.

671
00:38:19,707 --> 00:38:20,707
Nah.

672
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:24,111
"Nah"?

673
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,581
You telling me you haven't
learned your lesson?

674
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:29,783
Oh, I've learned a lesson, all right.

675
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,052
Just not the one
you wanted to teach.

676
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,588
Well, I'll just have to teach it again!

677
00:38:34,655 --> 00:38:36,022
Because I got you now, boy,

678
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:37,558
and I'm never letting you...

679
00:38:40,962 --> 00:38:42,496
Son of a...

680
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,432


681
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,202
That's pretty nice timing, Cass.

682
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:49,836
We had an appointment.

683
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:57,077
Don't ever change.

684
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:01,848
How did, Zachariah find you?

685
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,450
Long story.

686
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:05,785
Let's just stay away
from Jehovah's witnesses

687
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:07,421
from now on, okay?

688
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:09,256
What are you doing?

689
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:12,092
Something I should have
done in the first place.

690
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,250


691
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:51,298
Sam.

692
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:07,113
If you're serious and
you want back in...

693
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:12,819
...you should hang on to this.

694
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:14,588
I'm sure you're rusty.

695
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,264
Look man, I'm sorry.

696
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:29,236
I don't know. I'm...
whatever I need to be.

697
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,105
but I was, uh...

698
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:33,507
wrong.

699
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:36,976
What made you change your mind?

700
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:40,514


701
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:41,948
Long story.

702
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:47,387
The point is...

703
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:49,623
maybe we are each
other's Achilles' heel.

704
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:52,259
maybe they'll find a way
to use us against each other.

705
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:53,193
I don't know.

706
00:40:56,797 --> 00:40:59,466
I just know we're all we've got.

707
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:05,372
More than that.

708
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:09,876
We keep each other human.

709
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,047
Thank you.

710
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,951
Really, thank you.

711
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,553
I won't let you down.

712
00:41:19,621 --> 00:41:20,721
Oh, I know it.

713
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,890
I mean, you are the second-best
hunter on the planet.

714
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:30,530
So, what do we do now?

715
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,801
We make our own future.

716
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:37,804
Guess we have no choice.
