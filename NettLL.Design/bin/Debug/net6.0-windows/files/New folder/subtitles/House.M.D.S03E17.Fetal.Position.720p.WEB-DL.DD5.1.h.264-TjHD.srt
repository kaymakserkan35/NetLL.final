1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hey. Thanks.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,770
No, no, no... Here.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,900
You got this whole thing
wrong, Em.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,530
It's the rock star that's
supposed to be late, not
the rock-star photographer.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,740
Sorry. Morning sickness.
Touch the belly.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,940
It's the first time
I've been asked to do that.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,500
Come on. It's good luck.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,070
Okay.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,920
Hit the Kinos behind the drop.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,020
So what do you think?

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,860
I think people
aren't gonna get it.

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,160
Come on.
"All-American Rejects."

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,930
Juxtaposing a classic image
of Americana with
modern pop culture youth.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,230
Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,710
Everyone loves
a good juxtaposition.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,470
My fans were born in the '90s.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,110
You know what?
You do this picture,
you'll gain 40 years of fans.

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,810
Yeah?
Yeah.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,210
I love the Rockwell thing.
I thought so.

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,180
Okay. Kill the house lights.
Let's go!

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,330
Hang on. Hey, who's in charge
of the backdrop?

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,990
Naomi?
Yeah?

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,060
What's wrong with it?

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,730
Well, the words are
completely jumbled.

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,430
What, you can read that?

26
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,030
Of course.

27
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,740
You okay?
No. Oh, God.

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,800
I could be having a...

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,240
What's the mnemonic?

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,320
"F" is for face.
Is my smile crooked?

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,650
What are you doing?

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,350
"A" is for arms.

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,520
Arms.

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,890
You should really sit down.

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,450
Can someone
get her some water?

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,020
"S" is speech.

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,930
I'm slurring? I'm slurring?

38
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,170
"F-A-S-T."

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,570
"T" is for time.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,130
Hurry. Somebody, call 911.
Tell them I'm having a stroke.

41
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,680
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

42
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,690
My boss says you're important.

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,620
Personally I don't get
what's so hard about

44
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,660
making Scarlett Johansson
look pretty.

45
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,220
Arms out in front of you.

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,560
Palms up like
you're holding a pizza.

47
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,500
Close your eyes.

48
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,930
It's so easy you should
consider a career change.

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,530
Probably make
a lot more money.

50
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,040
Dr. Mackman tell you
the clot was clear?

51
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,270
Yes.

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,340
And he said that you
and the fetus are fine?

53
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,510
Yeah.

54
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,740
He didn't mention
your pronator drift?

55
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,650
What's that mean?

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,810
Means Mackman is an idiot.

57
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,810
May I?
Yeah.

58
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,620
So,

59
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,890
you take thousands
of photos of someone,

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,260
but only one has to look good.

61
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,630
Kind of the opposite
of my business.

62
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,100
It's not about looking good.

63
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,260
People are always
hiding things.

64
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,790
I just keep shooting
until I can see what's
really inside them.

65
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,800
My eyes okay?

66
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,100
Eyes are gorgeous.

67
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,310
The vessels don't look so hot.

68
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,070
Microaneurysms predict
further strokes.

69
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,310
This is gonna happen again?

70
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,910
Unless I can figure out
the underlying cause.

71
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,750
Puff up your cheeks.

72
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,890
You should be able to
keep the air in. Means there's
weakness around the mouth.

73
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,790
So where'd you learn
to self-diagnose a stroke?

74
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,520
Oh, my baby's biological
father is a neurologist.

75
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,330
He once told me the FAST
mnemonic could
save my life one day. So...

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,890
Interesting pet name.

77
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,260
Most people go with
"husband" or "pookie."

78
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,930
He's gay.

79
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,810
Just a sperm donor.
So when you...

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,610
You turned him
for a night?

81
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,440
Just straight for one date?

82
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,380
Okay.

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,380
He took a magazine and a cup
into my bathroom.

84
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,320
A man after my own heart.

85
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,290
Different magazine obviously.

86
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,220
I'm rescinding Mackman's
discharge order.

87
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,420
My lackeys will be in
to do some tests,

88
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,430
take some more blood
and empty your catheter bag.

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,030
Not a moment you'll
want to cherish.

90
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,340
This is definitely different.

91
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,570
It looks almost like...

92
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,480
He's caring.

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,820
Find anything else
in the patient's folder?
Like a diagnosis?

94
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,290
Urinalysis revealed
excessive protein
and red blood cells.

95
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,020
Chem panel showed
a creatinine level over 2.5.

96
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,660
So first she strokes,
now her kidneys
are shutting down. Why?

97
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,570
Ultrasound showed
no tumors or stones.

98
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,370
No signs of fetal distress.
No urinary tract obstructions.

99
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,140
BP is fine. No pre-eclampsia.

100
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,570
Any of you guys
ever been to the Galápagos?

101
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,940
Was our patient there?

102
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,040
Dengue fever, avian pox,
even West Nile.

103
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,210
No.

104
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,940
I'm looking for
a vacation spot.

105
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,210
That mean we get vacation?

106
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,880
How would that differ
from your current status?

107
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,250
You're gonna do what? Relax?

108
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,550
Visiting family.

109
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,990
My uncle's a giant turtle.

110
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,150
What if the kidney failure
came first?

111
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,720
Kidneys could've
caused the stroke
not the other way around.

112
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,820
Kidneys don't often
get stuck in the brain.

113
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,230
I'm saying it threw a clot.

114
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,330
Early symptoms
of kidney failure are nausea,
vomiting, ankle swelling.

115
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
She would've mistaken it
for morning sickness.

116
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,400
Heart's way more likely
to throw a clot than a kidney.

117
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,600
Echo was normal.
The history indicates
no sign of cardiac problems.

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,840
No, but if one were to read
the history closely,

119
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,180
one would notice
that she had six cases
of strep.

120
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,310
In her throat.
That's the one about
10 inches above her heart.

121
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,010
Let me rephrase,
six cases of untreated strep.

122
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,490
She was
prescribed antibiotics.

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,750
No one takes them all.

124
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,990
They stop when they
start feeling better.
All strep is untreated strep.

125
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,690
What happens when
strep goes untreated?

126
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,990
Leads to rheumatic fever.

127
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,390
Which leads to... Cameron?

128
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,620
Mitral valve stenosis.

129
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,690
Which is a thickening
in the valve of the... Kidney?

130
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,860
No.

131
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,530
The kidney doesn't have
a mitral valve.

132
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,700
We'll go look at her heart.

133
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,880
Be easy to find.

134
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,470
It's the big red pumping thing
about 10 inches
below her throat.

135
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,750
That was weird.

136
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,950
He was the way he always is.

137
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,490
Which is weird.

138
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,690
Very still, Emma.
Sorry.

139
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,980
No problem.

140
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,080
He caught us with your hand
up my shirt. He's gotta have
a reaction to that.

141
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,630
You think that's what
the vacation is?

142
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,720
Yes.

143
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,260
The pain of losing you
is obviously forcing him away.

144
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,730
Coronal slice appears normal.

145
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
There's no way House
just lets this slide.

146
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,600
He's gotta be
planning something.

147
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,770
Maybe he just
doesn't give a crap.

148
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,100
Sagittal slice is clean.

149
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,770
You think he just
stumbled into that closet?

150
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,070
He knew we were there
and he wanted us to know
that he knew.

151
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,880
Or you wanted him to know.

152
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,010
Now he does and you're annoyed
because he doesn't care.

153
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,510
Right there.

154
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,680
Trans-axial slice.
Calcified mitral valve.
Barely.

155
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,490
That's not big enough
to throw a clot.

156
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,860
Obviously it is,
because it did.

157
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,290
House was right.

158
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,590
A valve in your heart
is narrowed.

159
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,430
It caused the clot
which lead to your stroke,

160
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,060
and the reduced circulation
caused the problem
with your kidneys.

161
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,770
And this will fix it?

162
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,170
The balloon will
force the valve back open
and you'll be fine.

163
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,840
EMMA: Can we do this without
a sedative?

164
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,880
It's very mild.
There really is no risk
to the fetus.

165
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,580
We'll monitor your baby's
heart rate separately.

166
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,020
We won't allow it to
decrease anywhere
near dangerous levels.

167
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,350
Thank you.

168
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,520
You're both gonna be fine.

169
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,990
Go ahead, Dr. Cameron.

170
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,790
Listen to that heartbeat.
It sounds so...

171
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,270
Start threading the catheter.

172
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,370
No, I don't want a layover
in Frankfurt, Taipei,
Singapore or London, Ontario.

173
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,820
That's why I asked
for a direct flight to
Phnom Penh.

174
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,250
How hard is it to not land?
Does it matter what I answer?

175
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,750
Well, then fine.
I'd be delighted to hold.

176
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,890
What's new?
Can you tell Cuddy
to stop interfering?

177
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,190
It's her job. What's new?

178
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,700
Good news is
Emma's heart is fixed.

179
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,100
Bad news is it's not her
underlying problem.
Her kidneys are still failing.

180
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,140
You're vacationing
in Cambodia?

181
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,230
You gonna unwind
in the Killing Fields?
Nope.

182
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,140
Gonna catch me
a fish this big.

183
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,730
Mekong giant catfish.
Weighs over 600 pounds.

184
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,330
Aren't those catfish
critically endangered?

185
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,110
That's why it's my last chance
to catch one.

186
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,370
<i>All of our operators</i>
<i>are currently...</i>

187
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,610
If the mitral valve had been
properly fixed the kidney
should be getting better,

188
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,280
which leads us to
the conclusion that you
screwed up the procedure.

189
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,720
Or you screwed up
the diagnosis.

190
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,480
The mitral valve thickening
was so insignificant

191
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,680
it probably wasn't the cause
of the kidneys or the stroke.

192
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,990
Probably never would've
been a problem.

193
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,690
She needs dialysis
and we need a new theory.

194
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,590
CHASE: There are only
a few possibilities.

195
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,830
Patient's pregnant,
could be pre-eclampsia.

196
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,230
We eliminated it
before because...

197
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,630
Re-check for proteinuria
and low platelets. What else?

198
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,800
Hypoperfusion.

199
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,270
The fetus is basically
a parasite stealing nutrients,
minerals, blood.

200
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,430
Put her on telemetry.

201
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,810
Or the pregnancy
is irrelevant.

202
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,610
Could be infection,
sepsis, HUSITTP.

203
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,670
CHASE: A cholesterol embolism
is just as likely.

204
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,150
Tiny particles of cholesterol
rain down, clog up the small
vessels of the kidneys.

205
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,420
Get a smear and ultrasound
her vessels for plaque.

206
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,150
That's it.
Has to be one of those five.

207
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,460
You know what would be
even better? If we'd narrow it
all the way down to one.

208
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,230
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

209
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,890
<i>We are experiencing</i>
<i>extremely high call volume.</i>

210
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,090
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

211
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,270
She's 0 for five.

212
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,680
Either the differential
was wrong or she's faking it.

213
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,940
Kidney failure has to be
precipitated by...

214
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,480
One of the five
we've already ruled out.

215
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,080
The body only has so many ways
of screwing with the kidneys.

216
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,750
The labs must be wrong.
We did the labs.

217
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,450
No one else had access.

218
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,050
That's not quite true.

219
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,960
You put all your patients
through this many tests
or just the important ones?

220
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,570
We wanted to explore
all possibilities.

221
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,100
And?

222
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,140
We've eliminated
all the possibilities.

223
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,410
You telling me I'm dying
and you have no idea why?

224
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,510
Your body is
functioning properly.

225
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,140
So why are my kidneys failing?

226
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,890
The other body isn't.

227
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,820
There's something wrong
with the fetus.

228
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,900
Welcome to the world
of maternal mirror syndrome.

229
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,940
Mom's body is like

230
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,180
an intricate
German metro system.

231
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,080
All the trains run on time.

232
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,280
When she gets pregnant,
it's like a new station
opening in Düsseldorf.

233
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,180
Bunch or rookies
running things.
Bound to be mistakes.

234
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,520
Kids play on the tracks,
get electrocuted.

235
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,030
Before you know it,
the trains are backed up
all the way to Berlin

236
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,190
and you've got
a bunch of angry Germans
with nowhere to go.

237
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,130
And we all know
that ain't good for the Jews.

238
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,460
Who are the Jews
in this metaphor?

239
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,500
A few things can happen
to a fetus in distress.

240
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,830
It can become a miscarriage,
stillbirth,

241
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,170
a very sick baby
or on rare occasion
a time bomb

242
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,440
that kills mom
while it's dying.

243
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,570
Good news is,
we fix the fetus,
mom gets better.

244
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,740
It's the diagnostic equivalent
of a two-for-one sale.

245
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,080
I have read the outcome
of mirror syndrome
is almost always unfavorable.

246
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,020
"Unfavorable."
Is that doctor speak
for "dead baby"?

247
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,850
You think she'll be less upset
if you phrase it nicely?

248
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,120
We can tell her the truth,
that she'll be fine

249
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,960
as soon as we diagnose
a person who weighs
about one pound.

250
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,730
Can't touch it,
can't ask where it hurts,
can't see it.

251
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,740
If only there existed
giant machines that could
look through human skin.

252
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,330
Mirror syndrome
has a limited number
of known causes.

253
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,070
Tachyarrhythmia, fetal anemia,
placental chorioangioma.

254
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,340
All of which are fixable.

255
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,180
Which would be
un-unfavorable, right?

256
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,010
Could also be trisomy 13.

257
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,880
Ebstein's anomaly,
an aneurysm of Galen's vein.

258
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,580
And Dr. Storm Cloud
rained all over
the differential

259
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,490
and killed
the beautiful little baby.

260
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
Heart's easiest to see,
easiest to fix.
So let's start there.

261
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,350
When you did Mom's MRI,
did you get a look
at the fetus's heart?

262
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,830
It was in the range
but blurry. The fetus
was moving all over the place.

263
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,700
So we need another scan.
Yeah.

264
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,430
We'll just ask the fetus
to lie very, very still.

265
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,270
No need. I'm going to
paralyze it.

266
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,410
You wanna paralyze
Emma Sloan's baby?

267
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,470
Let me guess. Cameron?

268
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,610
Cameron and Chase
both had their concerns.

269
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,350
No, Cameron had concerns.

270
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,480
Chase just agreed with her

271
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,550
because he didn't want to lose
his all-access pass
to her love rug.

272
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,890
They're sleeping together?

273
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,220
If by "sleeping together"
you mean having sex
in the janitor's closet.

274
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,420
Here?

275
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,060
No, the janitor's closet
at the local high school.

276
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,930
Go, Tiger Cats!

277
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,960
Do you have one of those
camera phones? 'Cause I got
a MySpace account.

278
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,130
I will deal with them
after I deal with you.

279
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,830
Oh, come on.
Let's gossip some more.

280
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,570
I'm sure she's into bondage.

281
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,010
Paralyzing a one-pound baby
risks damaging...

282
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,520
Not paralyzing the thing
risks not getting
a clean MRI of its heart,

283
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,540
which we need to
save its life, which we need
to do to save Emma's life.

284
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,980
You're gonna need to
get her consent.

285
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,750
Well, that shouldn't be
too hard.

286
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,320
"Sign here or you
and your baby both die."

287
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,950
I'm going with you.

288
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,260
Oh, good.

289
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,130
You said sedation was risky.
This sounds insane.

290
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,170
The injection goes into
the umbilical cord.

291
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,600
The baby won't feel a thing.

292
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,510
Fetus.

293
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,150
I'm lowering expectations.
It works here and on dates.

294
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,840
The benefits outweigh
the risks

295
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,710
and the paralytic will
wear off in an hour, okay?

296
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,950
Must be easier to hear
you might die
than your baby might die.

297
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,490
But if there's anyone
I would trust to save my baby,

298
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,050
it would be Dr. House.

299
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,870
Fetus.

300
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,730
Hold this.

301
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,960
Dr. Cameron.
The MRI results back?

302
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,560
The fetus's heart
is structurally sound.

303
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,800
The problem's
with the bladder.
It's four times normal size.

304
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,860
Let me see.

305
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,910
The bladder's so engorged
it's taking up
the whole torso,

306
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,440
squeezing
all the other organs.

307
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,910
There's no room
for the lungs to develop.

308
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,840
The baby has a lower
urinary tract obstruction.

309
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,570
We can fix that
by inserting a shunt.

310
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,810
I'll give Emma the news.

311
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,710
Are you taking over the case?

312
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,310
House won't care.
He has his diagnosis.

313
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,210
Doctor Cameron.

314
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,320
Dating Chase can only end
in one of two ways.

315
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,420
House told you?

316
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,830
You get married
and live happily ever after,

317
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,700
or somebody gets hurt
and you two
can't work together,

318
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,100
and I have to fire somebody.

319
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,570
I would hate to see
my personal life become
such a burden to you.

320
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm telling you this
for your own good.

321
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,640
I assume you're gonna have
this same conversation
with Chase for his own good.

322
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,410
Chase isn't the one
that's gonna get hurt here.

323
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,160
There's only room for one
but I could skooch over.

324
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,290
My social life
is my social life.

325
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,660
Couldn't agree more.

326
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,070
What goes on in the privacy
of a janitor's closet
is nobody's business except...

327
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,110
She told me to end it.
Is that what you want?

328
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,970
I was actually hoping
she'd fire one of you.

329
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,270
What are you doing?

330
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,740
Trying to avoid
altitude sickness.

331
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,510
Couldn't score a direct flight
to Cambodia,

332
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,040
so I've decided to scale
Argentina's infamous
Mount Aconcagua.

333
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,880
Perfect except for the fact
that you can't walk.

334
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,150
There's a tribe of
Mocoví Indians who actually
carry the elders up...

335
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,550
You're insane.

336
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,250
I'm an insane genius.

337
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,660
I set the chamber
for low pressure
instead of high.

338
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,090
Thinner air builds up
the extra red blood cells,

339
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,460
creates new capillaries.

340
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,830
Few more days in here,
I can save myself six weeks
at base camp.

341
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,200
Where's my MRI?

342
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,370
There's a blockage
in the urinary tract.

343
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,430
Simple terms,
your baby can't pee.

344
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,100
His bladder is swollen
and it's crushing his lungs.

345
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,510
Can you fix it?

346
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,240
We can insert a small tube
in the baby's bladder

347
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,380
that makes the urine
come out straight through
his belly

348
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,180
for the duration
of the pregnancy.

349
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,450
The bladder decompresses
and the lungs will be able to
develop normally.

350
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,250
When the baby gets better,
you should get better.

351
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,450
First we just have to
do a test

352
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,360
to determine whether
the baby's kidneys
are functioning properly.

353
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,090
And what if they're not?

354
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,970
If they're already
too damaged, then there's
really nothing we can do.

355
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,200
If this doesn't work out
you can always try again.

356
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,270
I miscarried twice
when I was married.

357
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,570
After the divorce,
I tried in vitro like
four times before this.

358
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,350
I'm 42. Maybe it's
just not meant to be.

359
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,660
What are you doing?

360
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,200
You're trying to be me,
so I thought
I'd try to be you.

361
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,760
You don't have
the cleavage for it.

362
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,530
But I have a much tighter ass.

363
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,130
Think every day should be
naked Thursday
or is that an oxymoron?

364
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,570
Let me see the results
from the bladder tap.

365
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,410
They aren't back yet.

366
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,840
They're gonna be inconclusive.

367
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,580
You think my diagnosis
is wrong?

368
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,170
Fetus doesn't pee,
amniotic fluid should be low.

369
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,410
Mom's level is fine.

370
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,610
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

371
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,520
Could just mean
we caught the obstruction
early.

372
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,350
Either way your test
will be inconclusive.

373
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,480
The urine you've collected
has been sitting in that
fetus's bladder for weeks.

374
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,090
As my pappy always said,
"Stale pee is useless pee."

375
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,720
Fine. I'll do another tap.

376
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,890
Just as useless.

377
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,430
Old urine drops down
from the kidney
right after the first tap

378
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,560
'cause it's so backed up.

379
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,160
Bladder tap number three
will give you
the freshest pee.

380
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,940
That's when you'll find out
if this fetus has even
a fighting chance.

381
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,270
Thank you.

382
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,380
I'll run two more taps.

383
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,380
Since when does
the Dean of Medicine
run bladder taps?

384
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,820
She's an important patient.

385
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,250
Because she takes pictures
or because she's you?

386
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,510
Woman in her 40s, single,

387
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,730
using a turkey baster
as a last gasp at motherhood.

388
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,620
Maybe you want to
make sure she succeeds
so you'll still have hope.

389
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,440
You can't be a good doctor
if you're not objective.

390
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,770
It's your file.
I don't want it.

391
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,930
Then why did you just
say all that stuff?

392
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,410
To humiliate you.

393
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,780
You're taking the case back.
I don't want it.

394
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,840
Your diagnosis is right.
I want to go on vacation.

395
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,540
You can go on vacation
after you've cured her.

396
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,050
CHASE: Good news.

397
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,220
The fetus's urine
had appropriate levels
of protein and electrolytes,

398
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,230
so its kidneys aren't damaged.

399
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,330
Oh, wow.

400
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,320
We're gonna put the shunt in.

401
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,230
Your baby's lungs
should have more room to grow

402
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,700
and your symptoms
should go away.

403
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,670
But he'll still need surgery,
after he's born?

404
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,270
That's when we'll
remove the blockage
in the ureter.

405
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,910
You'll be the only mother
on the planet who appreciates
the value of a wet diaper.

406
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,640
Hey, could you hand me that?

407
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,150
I'm keeping
a visual memory book

408
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,750
of this entire surreal process
and this is the best part
of the story so far.

409
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,620
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks.

410
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,090
When'd you take this?

411
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,720
She did the
second bladder tap.

412
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,960
You should keep it.

413
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,760
Oh, I see her all day at work.
I don't need it.

414
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,270
Maybe you want to see her
after work.

415
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,770
I'm right, right?

416
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,570
I saw the way you look at her.

417
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,950
Thanks.

418
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,560
The shunt is
in the right position.

419
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,500
Bladder is starting
to decompress.

420
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,730
No infection.

421
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,740
Did House say anything else?
About us?

422
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,710
I thought you didn't
care about his reaction.
Trying to make him jealous?

423
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,040
I like my job.

424
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,110
He can't fire you
just because we're together.

425
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,310
We're not "together,"
and House can do
whatever he wants.

426
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,150
How's my baby?
Doing just fine, Emma.

427
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,250
So are you.

428
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,490
My stomach's killing me.

429
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,160
That's not her stomach.

430
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,860
Can you open your eyes, Emma?
I just need to take a look.

431
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
What is it?

432
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,570
Emma's jaundiced.
Her liver's shutting down.

433
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,410
Figures.
Just booked my trip
to Johnston Strait.

434
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,510
I thought you were
climbing Mount Whatever
in Argentina.

435
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,280
Apparently I'd have to live
with the Mocoví Indians
for 20 years

436
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,150
before they'd consider me
an elder.

437
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,680
Decided to go kayaking
with orca instead.
No legs required.

438
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,990
Can't leave yet.
Liver failure puts her case
back into the unsolved pile.

439
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,260
Increased AST, ALT
and her bilirubin's
off the charts.

440
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,400
Even fetuses lie.

441
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,070
We diagnosed a lower
urinary tract obstruction
because we saw one.

442
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,540
What if that's not
the whole story?

443
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,280
What if the little bugger
is hiding something?

444
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,280
The real reason
for the mirror syndrome.

445
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,820
Have we looked under its bed?

446
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,050
We checked its diary?

447
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,780
If it's not GU,
could be the heart.

448
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,090
Hypoplastic
left heart syndrome.

449
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,820
There were no
structural problems.
The lungs.

450
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,730
We won't be able to
get a good look
until they develop.

451
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,790
It'll be weeks...
She's not gonna last weeks.

452
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,130
What do you want to do?

453
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,260
Maternal mirror syndrome
has one sure fire cure.

454
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,200
Deliver the fetus.

455
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,640
That's not viable at 21 weeks.
You'll kill the baby.

456
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,940
Fetus.
Semantics
make you feel better?

457
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,030
Pretend it's not a person?

458
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,170
Can it play catch? Can it eat?

459
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,210
Can it take pretty pictures?

460
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,480
Who wants to tell her?

461
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,420
The swollen bladder
was not the only problem.

462
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,360
We can't leave it inside you.
We have to terminate.

463
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,330
Well, can't you deliver him?

464
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,570
Put him on a respiratory
machine till you
figure out what's wrong?

465
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,870
We can. And it won't matter.

466
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,880
The fetus is still at least
two weeks away
from being viable.

467
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,840
Well, I'll suffer through this
for two more weeks then.

468
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,620
You're on dialysis
for your kidneys.
Your kidneys can wait.

469
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,020
They don't make dialysis
for your liver.

470
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,190
You're not gonna make it
two more days.

471
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,530
I'm not gonna let you
kill my baby.

472
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,700
It's killing you.

473
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,370
I'm not having an abortion.

474
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,810
It's not a baby. It's a tumor.

475
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,150
I understand
dying for a cause.

476
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,490
Sacrificing your life so
your child might live. But
that's not the choice here.

477
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,160
Either it dies
or you both die.

478
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,270
Or you fix him
and we both live.

479
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,860
I can't fix it.

480
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,140
I'm scheduling a D&C.

481
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,470
I won't consent.

482
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,370
So I guess
you have two days
to figure it out.

483
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,060
Her kidneys are
almost irreparable.

484
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,360
She's developed severe DIC.
You have to force her
to terminate.

485
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,130
Did you give corticosteroids
to speed up the baby's
lung development?

486
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,900
No. I dropped an anvil
on its chest to prevent
lung development.

487
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm trying to extinguish
the human race
one fetus at a time.

488
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,240
Give the lungs more time
to expand so you can
see inside them.

489
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,510
See if they're the problem.

490
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,480
My real patient is dying.

491
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,080
Very quickly. Like I wouldn't
advise her to buy
any green bananas.

492
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,310
The fetus is nothing more
than a parasite at this point.

493
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,850
Removing it
is an instant cure.

494
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,690
You're not gonna get Emma
to see it that way.

495
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,880
She's probably already
named the baby,

496
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,020
read him books,
had conversations with him.

497
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,760
See, you get it.
She'll listen to you.
No.

498
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:34,060
If you let this woman refuse
to terminate, you're helping
her commit suicide.

499
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,600
As her doctor
my recommendation is
against suicide.

500
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,100
If the baby had a doctor,

501
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,170
I think she would recommend
exhausting all possibilities
before taking its life.

502
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,300
Then she'd be an idiot.

503
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,070
Too bad she's your boss!

504
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,810
What if our original
assumption is wrong?

505
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,150
It isn't.

506
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,950
If we assume
she doesn't have
mirror syndrome,

507
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,490
then terminating her pregnancy
isn't gonna
help her liver at all.

508
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,650
We eliminated
all other possibilities.

509
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,060
The fetus is hydropic
and in distress.

510
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,220
Emma's kidneys and liver
are failing.
The diagnosis is solid.

511
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,200
Wow! The ass-kisser
won't agree with you.

512
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,130
You must be even wronger
than I thought.

513
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,290
Fine.

514
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,270
Let's assume she had
mirror syndrome

515
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,140
but we fixed it when we fixed
the baby's bladder.

516
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,140
That means that
her failing liver would be
completely unrelated.

517
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,700
If it is, we can fix it and
we don't have to terminate.

518
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,770
So her theory is
that our patient's
liver problems

519
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,010
were just a giant coincidence.

520
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,420
It's not a surprising
coincidence.

521
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,650
Pregnant women
can develop liver problems.

522
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,560
If this is the case,
we can actually
do something here.

523
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,260
Don't you guys
think that's worth exploring?

524
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,460
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
would have the same symptoms.

525
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,970
Thank you.
Brownnoser.

526
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,100
Viral hepatitis,
HELLP syndrome.
Oh, look.

527
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,340
Sticking up
for your girlfriend.
Who says chivalry's dead?

528
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,140
He's not joking?

529
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,080
Be patient. She's going
through all of us. She'll get
that jungle fever eventually.

530
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,210
I'm not going through anyone.
You love him?

531
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,320
This can probably wait until
after you biopsy Emma's liver,
right?

532
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,330
We can't.
Her platelets are too low.

533
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,020
Once we pierce her liver,
it'll be next to impossible
to stop the bleeding.

534
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,530
Come in from above.

535
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,630
Instead of going straight in
through her abdomen,

536
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,100
go in through the veins
in her neck.

537
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,070
Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

538
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,010
If the liver starts to bleed,
it'll bleed right back
into her own veins.

539
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,690
Why don't you start
your vacation now?

540
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,290
Threading the guide wire
through the right
internal jugular vein.

541
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,960
So, the sleep lab...

542
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,660
You and Cameron not sleeping.

543
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,270
How serious is it?

544
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,500
It's nothing.

545
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,050
She's only doing it
to make House jealous.

546
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,380
Then why are you doing it?
You kidding?

547
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,420
You're approaching
the inferior vena cava.
Slow down.

548
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,440
You better not hurt her.

549
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,720
She already has a big brother.
She does?

550
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,760
You obviously care
very deeply about her.

551
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,520
I'm not protecting her.
I'm protecting myself.

552
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,260
A heartbroken,
lovesick Cameron

553
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,960
would be even more unbearable
than she is now.

554
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,290
You're through
the hepatic vein.

555
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,860
(MACHINE BEEPING)
I'm firing the needle.

556
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,300
Heart rate and BP spiking.
Get that out of her.

557
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,180
Fetus's heart rate
just dropped to 50.

558
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,310
We've got contractions.
Pre-term labor.

559
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,250
Start a terbutaline drip!

560
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,060
We were able to control
the pre-term labor
with tocolytics.

561
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,060
The contractions
have subsided for now.

562
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,100
And the liver biopsy
was negative. This is
definitely mirror syndrome.

563
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,160
Her baby's doing this to her.

564
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,260
We're out of options.

565
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,030
Did the biopsy cause
the pre-term labor
or did it happen on its own?

566
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,330
It doesn't make a difference.

567
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,840
Pre-term labor
can be a new symptom.

568
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,570
New information gives us
new theories.
Isn't that how it works?

569
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,670
Not in this case.

570
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,310
Her body's trying to do
what you refuse to, get the
baby out and save itself.

571
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,650
Patient's transaminases
are 10 times normal.

572
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,580
Her liver is on the verge
of shutting down completely.

573
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,780
A torch test could...

574
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,690
We don't have time
for more tests.

575
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,920
We have to terminate
or she'll die.

576
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,050
Then let's work faster.

577
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:25,330
Medicine doesn't work faster
just because you
hope real hard.

578
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,460
But it could help to see
what the baby's been hiding.

579
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,530
The only organ we haven't
been able to look inside
is its lungs.

580
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,700
The problem must be in there.

581
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,640
We haven't been able to
see inside because
they're underdeveloped.

582
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,580
We've already got her
on corticosteroids, but it'll
take weeks for them...

583
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Then let's drown them
in corticosteroids,
multiple courses.

584
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,810
Speed up their development.

585
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,820
Giving the baby more than one
course will suppress
adrenal gland function.

586
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,120
Have long-term adverse effects
on fetal organ development.

587
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,280
Worse than death?
Emma's already on tocolytics.

588
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,260
The combination could put her
into pulmonary edema.

589
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,660
You'll just kill her faster.

590
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,160
It's the only chance we have
to see inside those lungs.

591
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,390
We're just gonna have to
make the baby better faster
than we make Emma worse.

592
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,070
Come on! This is the kind
of thing House does every day.

593
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,870
House thought we should
terminate six hours ago.

594
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,580
I'll do it myself.

595
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,910
Anybody gonna stop her?

596
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,540
Stopping the madness
is her job.

597
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,090
Somebody's got to be
Cuddy's Cuddy.

598
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,320
Nurse!

599
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,870
Pulmonary edema?
Who tattled?
It doesn't matter.

600
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,980
There's a reason we don't give
multiple courses
of corticosteroids.

601
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,530
Gee, thanks.

602
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,870
It's time to terminate.

603
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,110
That's not what she wants.

604
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,410
Look at her.

605
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,820
She didn't want to be
an incubator for a dead baby,
but that's what you've done.

606
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,650
Either get me a laryngoscope
or get out!

607
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,530
You were right.

608
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,160
You were all right.

609
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,730
Now the mom's lungs
are shutting down.

610
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,770
She's dying faster
than the baby's lungs
are developing.

611
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,810
I had to stop
the corticosteroids.

612
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,610
Have you spoken to the family?

613
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,050
The only family she's got
is that baby.

614
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,640
Well, he's biased.

615
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,750
What do you think
House would do?

616
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,190
House wants to terminate.

617
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,480
I mean if he didn't.

618
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,360
If he shared my position,
what do you think he would do?

619
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,450
He wouldn't share your pain.

620
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,660
He'd be objective.

621
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,860
Right.

622
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,530
He would prioritize
his problems.

623
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
He'd terminate.

624
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,930
He wouldn't be afraid
of screwing with her lungs
if there was a bigger issue.

625
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,030
There is no bigger issue.

626
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,080
She needs her lungs.
Not right now.

627
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,050
She's already on a respirator.

628
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,510
The machine is
breathing for her.

629
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,170
I can do whatever
I want to her lungs.

630
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,220
If you're playing catch in
the living room and you break
your mother's vase,

631
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,760
you may as well
keep playing catch.
The vase is already broken.

632
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,380
Yeah, except that room
can't breathe
without that vase.

633
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,860
I'm putting her back on
corticosteroids.

634
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,960
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

635
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,670
It worked.
What worked?

636
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,500
I got the baby's lungs
to expand.

637
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,400
We should be able to figure...
Cab's on its way.

638
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,470
I have to finish packing.

639
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,240
I have a whole new
appreciation for what you do.

640
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,710
How hard it is to believe
when everyone around you

641
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,770
is telling you
that you're wrong.

642
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,750
Helps to know they're idiots.

643
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,390
Do you think I'm an idiot?

644
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,680
You're not objective.

645
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,060
But you're not an idiot.

646
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,400
These lungs are still
two weeks away
from being viable.

647
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,020
But big enough
for a diagnosis.

648
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,690
These tissue buds are new.

649
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,240
Could indicate
bronchopulmonary sequestration

650
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,170
or diaphragmatic eventration.

651
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,140
I was thinking bronchogenic
cyst or bronchial atresia.

652
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,010
Could be lung lesions, CCAM.

653
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,170
What about...

654
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,080
Move.

655
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,520
Thought you
started your vacation.

656
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,620
Somebody had to save
our boss's rotundous ass.

657
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,960
Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.

658
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,300
Small buds in the lungs
could indicate...
Thanks.

659
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,000
Got the multiple choice
all worked out.

660
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,300
Question is, how do we pick
between A, B, C, D,
and none of the above?

661
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,810
Portable MRI is in her room.
We could get a current image.

662
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,870
The fetal lungs are so tiny
the MRI won't give us
the detail we need.

663
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,080
What would we do
if this patient were
not just a tadpole?

664
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,620
Say it was an actual person.

665
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,020
He is a person.

666
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,750
Thanks for playing along.

667
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,580
Pretend it's
a one-pound adult.

668
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,390
Forget the mom,
forget the womb, the placenta.

669
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,980
How would we get a better look
at what's in the lungs?

670
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,290
Transesophageal echo.

671
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,660
Can't access his esophagus.

672
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,390
High resolution CT
could give us a clearer...

673
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,030
Too much radiation
for a one-pound person.

674
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,400
You can't just shoot
everything down, Chase.

675
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,770
You're not me. Collaborate.

676
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,300
A ventilation perfusion scan
would be next.

677
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,140
How do we get a fetus
to breathe in
a radioactive isotope, idiot?

678
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,470
If it were really a person
and we had no other options

679
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,210
we'd do an
exploratory surgery.

680
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,690
Cut into its chest
and have a look around.

681
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,050
Let's do that.

682
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,660
You're the one who insists
we treat it like a person.

683
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,720
I'll put it back
when I'm done.

684
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,260
Me again.

685
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,030
It's your friendly
neighborhood belly squirter.

686
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,330
We're gonna do
open fetal surgery.

687
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,370
Open the uterus,
cut out the fetus
so we can look around.

688
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,940
I know you can't talk so
I need you to look petrified
if you consent.

689
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,110
The umbilical cord
won't be cut.

690
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,020
During surgery, your body
will basically serve as
the baby's heartllung machine.

691
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,520
We find what's wrong
and we fix it.

692
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,650
If we can.

693
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,060
Don't lower expectations
if you want them
to do something.

694
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,250
She should know
what she's facing.

695
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,620
This is incredibly dangerous.

696
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,670
It risks both your lives.

697
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,930
The only reason why
we're suggesting

698
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,700
it is because there's
nothing else we can do.

699
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,790
You all here
for the fetal surgery?

700
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,990
'Cause we're
way over capacity.

701
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,060
Mind each other's
personal space.

702
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,430
There are sharp implements
in the room.

703
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,840
Like this one.

704
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,680
Uterus is fully exposed.

705
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,020
And we're in.

706
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,220
Start draining
the amniotic fluid.

707
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,530
Have you never sucked beer
out of the bottom of a keg?

708
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,860
Where'd you go to college?
Give me that.

709
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,430
Affix the pulse ox
to the palm.

710
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,330
House?

711
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,400
Sorry.

712
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,630
Just realized
I forgot to TiVo <i>Alien.</i>

713
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,780
Fetal heart rate good.
Stats are stable.

714
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,720
Position him for the incision.

715
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,560
I see three well-defined
lesions.

716
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,930
It's definitely CCAM.
I should be able to
resect them.

717
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,060
(MONITOR BEEPING)

718
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,700
It's the mom. She's in V-fib.

719
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,610
Charging.

720
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,540
Clear!
I'm clear.

721
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,120
Looks like asystole.
Paddling isn't
going to do anything.

722
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,590
It's fine V-fib.
I'm going again. Clear!

723
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,420
We're gonna lose them both.
Clamp!

724
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,790
The surgery's not
doing this to her.
The fetus is.

725
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,420
Step away, House.
I'm going again.

726
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,960
The only way to save her
is to cut away the anchor
holding her down.

727
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,660
You keep going,
you're gonna get electrocuted.

728
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,230
Clear!

729
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,200
Going again. Clear!

730
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,110
(MONITOR BEEPING)

731
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,850
Heart rate's returning
to normal.

732
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,610
Continue with the lobectomy.

733
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,530
So my kidneys, liver and lungs
are all fine just like that?

734
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,030
Just like that.
That's amazing.

735
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:01,140
What's amazing
is how blonde your
baby's hair is.

736
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,810
My baby?

737
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,070
The thing in your belly
that tried to kill you.

738
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,450
You've never called him
a baby before.

739
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,220
Any pain?

740
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,920
Nothing I can't deal with.

741
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,550
You can only get out of bed
to pee, pooh or shower.

742
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,960
And absolutely no sex.
So stop flirting with me.

743
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,760
Sorry.

744
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,600
So this really worked?
He'll be normal?

745
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,070
Well, if you call
being born twice normal.

746
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,850
Hey, thank you.

747
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,650
Don't thank me.
I would've killed the kid.

748
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,330
Wanna grab a bite?
In a minute.

749
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,500
Emma asked me to
bring up her camera.

750
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,040
I'll walk with you.

751
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,700
When'd she take
this picture of you?

752
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,810
You look so...

753
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,540
I'm smiling.

754
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,240
I have a nice smile.

755
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,620
No, I've never
seen you like this.

756
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,450
She got you to glow.

757
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,220
What were you doing?

758
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,930
What did she say to you?

759
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,830
I always glow.

760
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,140
House.

761
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,780
Need you to take
a look at something.

762
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,210
I'm off the clock.
Just open it.

763
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,280
A first-class ticket
to Vancouver Island.

764
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,230
Shoot! The wrong envelope.

765
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,100
I think it's great.
Yeah.

766
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,200
Who doesn't like Canadians?
It's big.

767
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,670
You're trying to have a life.
You're trying to
enjoy yourself.

768
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,610
You didn't need to apologize.

769
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,010
I'm not. I told you why I...

770
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,240
Screwed up.

771
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,410
I saved a life.
I saved two lives.

772
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,610
You

773
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,280
let your maternal instinct
get the best of you
and nearly kill two people.

774
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,020
Case like this, you terminate,
mom lives 10 times out of 10.

775
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,150
You do what you did

776
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,220
mom and baby both die
9.9 times out of 10.

777
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,060
Sometimes point one
is bigger than 9.9.

778
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,100
No, it's smaller.

779
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,970
Exactly 9.8 smaller.
Always is. Always will be.

780
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,340
Well, not for Emma.
And not for her son.

781
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,640
Now go away and be happy.
