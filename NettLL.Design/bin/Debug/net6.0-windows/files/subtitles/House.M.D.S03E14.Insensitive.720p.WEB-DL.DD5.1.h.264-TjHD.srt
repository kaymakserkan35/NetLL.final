1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,730
I'm okay. Let's just go home.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,770
You're getting checked out.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,530
I tripped on the ice.
Eight other kids tripped.
This is embarrassing.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,170
You said you were just gonna
hang with your friends.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,540
I turn around,
and you're out there
on the ice.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,910
I'm fine.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,500
You don't know that.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,020
You fell awkwardly.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,310
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,750
You don't know how to fall.

11
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,750
I'm 16.
I've been falling a lot.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,020
I think I'm getting
the hang of it. And I checked.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,920

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,250
<i>(MUSIC STOPS)</i>

15
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,460
And now the doctors
are gonna check.

16
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,860
You don't think that
you're overreacting?

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,060
I don't need you
to fix every booboo.

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,500
Then stop getting them.

19
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,900
I was just playing around
with my friends.
I was having fun.

20
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,340
You know you can't do that.

21
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,670
Oh, I can't have fun.

22
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,180
You know what I mean.
I'm going to have
a talk with your friends.

23
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,540
No!
They need to stop.

24
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,280
No, I don't want you
freaking them out.

25
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,050
Fine. Fine, we'll go to the
hospital, but they're going
to tell you that I'm fine,

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,560
and they're going to tell you
that you don't need to
worry about...

27
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,120
(TRUCK HORN BLARING)
Mom!

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,830
Mom?

29
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,590
Mom?

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,800
Hello?

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,420
Mom, you gotta wake up.
No one's coming. Mom!

32
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,730
<i>WOMAN.: 911,</i>
<i>what's your emergency?</i>

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,460
We got into an accident
along the Canal Road
just outside Kingston.

34
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,040
My mom's unconscious.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,440
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

36
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,300
I'm fine.

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,380
Mom? Mom?

38
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,090
Where's Foreman?

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,650
He's down here somewhere.

40
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,100
"Somewhere." Very helpful.

41
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,100
Do you have any idea
when he's getting out tonight?

42
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,470
Sometime.

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,830
I realize you can't predict.

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,500
I just thought you might be
able to estimate.
It's Valentines Day.

45
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,200
I've planned
a surprise getaway.

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,500
Get away.

47
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,400
Get away.

48
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,180
Get away.

49
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,520
Is my mom okay?

50
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,220
She's gone to surgery.

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,120
Foreman, your girlfriend
wants to know if you're
available for Valentine's.

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,530
Act surprised.
What are you doing down here?

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,730
There's a snowstorm.
ER's short-staffed.
We're all supposed to be here.

54
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,940
You're supposed to be here.
You're an ass. Act surprised.

55
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,870
This could sting a little.

56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,880
Can we hurry this up?
Make sure that...

57
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,440
Take your time.
What's your name?

58
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,720
Hannah Morganthal.

59
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,990
You have CIPA,
Hannah Morganthal.

60
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,290
No, I don't.

61
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,530
We have to do x-rays to
make sure you don't have
internal injuries,

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,260
blood tests to make sure
no infections.

63
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:38,770
EEG for neurological anomalies
and biopsy a spinal nerve.

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,610
Congenital insensitivity
to pain is one of the rarest
conditions on the planet.

65
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,050
There's only been
about 60 documented cases.

66
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,350
Yeah, and I have seven reasons
to think that
she's one of them.

67
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,610
She says she's not.

68
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,550
And that's reason number one.

69
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,950
She knew what it was
without us telling her.

70
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,490
Two, she's still wet from
the snow. She's not shivering.
That's odd,

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,220
unless she can't sweat
or feel hot and cold.

72
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,200
The ambulance was warm.

73
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,830
I want to see my mother.

74
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,960
Three, scarring around
the lips and tongue.

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,560
When she was a baby,
she chewed on herself
without feeling it.

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,340
I fell through a window
when I was a kid.

77
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,170
Four, when you cleaned
the wound,

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,940
she flexed into the cleaner
instead of away from it.

79
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,910
It's hard to fake pain
when you've never felt it.

80
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,350
It takes an imaginative leap,
Ms. Morganthal.
That's one of them Jew names.

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,620
Ashkenazis are a
higher-risk group.

82
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,890
On the other hand,
she says she doesn't have it,

83
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,550
and she'd be dead by now
if she'd never been diagnosed.

84
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,120
They killed our Lord.
You're gonna trust them?

85
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,000
She wants to see her mom.
She admits having CIPA,

86
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,940
she knows we're not
letting her go anywhere
without a battery of tests.

87
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,440
You said you had
seven reasons.

88
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,310
I pulled a number
out of the air.

89
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,640
What, five isn't enough?

90
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,610
Five lame reasons aren't.

91
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,740
I'm taking her to
see her mom as soon as...

92
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,920
I can hit her again
if six isn't enough.

93
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,710
Do the tests.

94
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,320
Need to bail on the ER.
I got a case.

95
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,990
Why are you wearing perfume?

96
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,160
Is this a real case

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,140
or one of those imaginary
cases that happen
when you're bored?

98
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,730
CIPA.

99
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,240
CIPA is a diagnosis.

100
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,670
Diagnoses happen
at the end of cases.

101
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,940
She's got no idea
what's going on in her body.

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,410
There's bound to be
something wrong.

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,250
In other words,
she could be
perfectly healthy,

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,080
but you're curious
about someone who
can't feel pain

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,890
because you always feel pain,
so you want to go exploring.

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,790
She was in a car accident.

107
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,260
She needs x-rays,
blood tests, EEG,
nerve biopsy.

108
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,730
I also note that,
although snow is coming down
in sheets this morning,

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,860
you left your hat at home,
and you used earmuffs.

110
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,400
Do your tests,
except for the...

111
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,630
So while everyone else
was just worrying
about getting in,

112
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,040
you were concerned
with hat head.

113
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,510
Blind dates are
never a good idea.

114
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,780
Only reason to wear a scarf
like that is as a beacon
to identify you in a crowd.

115
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,120
Do your tests,
except for the nerve biopsy.

116
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,280
I need the nerve biopsy.
You'd risk paralyzing her.

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,520
It's neurological.

118
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,530
You have no evidence of that.

119
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,320
She tripped.

120
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,230
Do you have any evidence,
other than the fact

121
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,740
that a typically clumsy
CIPA patient tripped
on an icy day?

122
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,310
If the EEG reveals a problem,
we can talk then.

123
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,540
Could have left the scarf
at home and just told him

124
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,670
you'd be wearing
a look of desperation.

125
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,780
Spiking on leads C-3 and O-2.

126
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,120
She could be going into
a seizure.

127
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,460
HANNAH: Hello?
I think there's
a simpler explanation.

128
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,400
You're not gonna
find anything. I'm fine!
I want to see my mom!

129
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,460
So sedate her.

130
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,860
She won't consent.

131
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,300
She's a teenager.

132
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,300
No dad.
Mom's still in surgery.

133
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,430
What do you want us to do?
Hold her down?

134
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,370
Well, only until you
inject her with a sedative.
Then you can let her go.

135
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,640
We tried.

136
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,940
Seriously?

137
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,740
She's strong and doesn't care.
We'd have broken something

138
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,940
before we can get her
to sit still enough
to inject her.

139
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,110
So break her arm.
She won't mind.

140
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,450
You're cranky.
I'm in pain.

141
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,220
Come on,
let's go break her arm.

142
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,730
Nurse Shortie, your biznitch,
how long are you going to
waste her time?

143
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm so glad
we're walking somewhere.

144
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,430
Another 60 feet,
and this conversation is over.

145
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,130
When you guys are
out of this program,
Cameron will find somebody,

146
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,700
Chase will find
eight somebodies,
and you'll be alone.

147
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,010
Thirty feet.
You'll date, and you'll date,

148
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,670
but you're the ultimate
Darwinian. You have to
fight for everything.

149
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,720
Anybody else
would just slow you down.
Yeah.

150
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm still with her, aren't I?

151
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,140
Yeah.

152
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,050
I can only imagine it's
because she hasn't given you
an excuse to break up,

153
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,520
and you don't have the guts
to recognize your own reality.

154
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,790
I want to see my mother.

155
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,090
Hi again.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I'm sure I could say this
without being condescending,

157
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,330
but then you'd get
the false impression
that I respect you,

158
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,840
so you're a kid,
you're scared,
you're stalling, grow up.

159
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,970
I'm not scared.
I'm never scared.

160
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,440
See? How juvenile was that?

161
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,570
You can't feel pain.
Nothing left but pleasure.

162
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,510
Why don't you tell me
how wonderful that is?

163
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,680
It sucks.

164
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,280
Better than being
in pain all the time.

165
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,050
Get in the chair.

166
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,020
Every morning,
I have to check my eyes

167
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,060
to make sure
I didn't scratch a cornea
in my sleep.

168
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,530
Oh, God, stop.
I'm in a pool of tears here.

169
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,590
I can't cry.

170
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,960
Neither can I.

171
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,670
Every morning,
I check my eyes for jaundice

172
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,330
in case the Vicodin's
finally shot my liver.

173
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,670
I can't run anywhere
without examining all my toes

174
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,730
for swelling.
I can't run.

175
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,400
Boys can't hold me
for too long
because I can overheat.

176
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,640
Girls can't hold me
for too long because
I only pay for an hour.

177
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,520
I need an alarm on my watch
to remind me to
go to the bathroom.

178
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,150
Know how many humiliating
experiences before
I thought of that?

179
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,950
Bathroom is 50 feet
from my office.
Every drink of water,

180
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,460
I weigh the pros and cons.

181
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,650
After everything I do,
I self-check.

182
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,100
Mouth, tongue,
gums for cuts, count teeth,
check temperature,

183
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,140
fingers, toes and joints
for swelling,
skin for bruises.

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,900
I got shot.

185
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,370
I sat on a stove
when I was three.
Want to see the coil marks?

186
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah.
You think I'm lying?

187
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,810
You think I would just want to
check out your <i>tuchus,</i>

188
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,820
as your people would say?

189
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,460
Put her in the chair
and run the damn test. If she
moves again, give her nitrous.

190
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,060
You weren't shot because
of leg pain. You were shot
because you're a jerk.

191
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,530
Some think
the two are connected.

192
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,000
<i>(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)</i>

193
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,940
He didn't have to do that.

194
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,640
Yeah, he did.

195
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,980
I'm sick?

196
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,140
No, your EEG was normal.

197
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,880
X-ray showed no break.

198
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,050
Blood tests showed
no infections.
Urine indicated no...

199
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,520
Hannah?

200
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,830
Call a code! Oh, God.

201
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,020
Need ice packs
and cooling blankets.

202
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,770
Got saline in there?
She's not flushed.

203
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,230
She's not sweating.
You must be...

204
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,360
She has a temperature of 105.

205
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,050
Wow, she's actually sick.

206
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,650
We got her temperature
down below boiling.
It could be infection.

207
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,160
No, LP showed normal proteins
and no white blood cells.

208
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,460
High bilirubin.
Could be a liver problem.

209
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,370
Nope, transaminases
were normal.
Could be drugs.

210
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,870
She's smoked pot
since she was 11.

211
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,630
No again.
Tox screen was clean.

212
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,970
We're doing
this case backwards.

213
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,600
We do the tests,
and then she gets sick?

214
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,670
Maybe we did something to her.
Maybe she got
sick after the tests.

215
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,610
We should rerun them.

216
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,710
And biopsy a spinal nerve.

217
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,810
You want to risk paralysis
because she's got a fever?

218
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,290
I want to risk paralysis
because I don't know
what's causing the fever.

219
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,950
If it's neurological...
It's a fever.

220
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,660
In a CIPA patient. Obviously
things are a little different
in her upstairs wiring.

221
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,460
And have been since
the day she was born.

222
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,930
Yeah, it's much more likely

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,700
that whatever it is
was cleverly waiting
and hiding

224
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,140
until you guys
were done testing.

225
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,300
Where are you going?

226
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,900
You're all against this,
right?

227
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,970
And you're all gonna stand
on principle and refuse
to do it, right?

228
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,850
I'm going to get
Cuddy's approval.

229
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,790
CAMERON: How long are we going
to keep Hannah in the dark
about her mother?

230
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,950
CHASE: Long as possible.

231
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,960
Side airbags
should be standard.

232
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,930
I'm sure she'll agree.

233
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,330
She should know
her mother's situation.

234
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,100
Breaking that news
is that surgeon's problem.

235
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,300
Any word from House?

236
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,460
No.

237
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,670
Well, maybe Cuddy will say no.

238
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,300
Cuddy never says no.

239
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,570
That's not true.

240
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,620
Nobody ever says no.
We don't say no.

241
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,010
You don't say no.

242
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,950
He'll come back.
He'll browbeat us.

243
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,320
He'll give us seven reasons,
and eventually we'll fold.
We all will, not just me.

244
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,390
The only way
we can avoid biopsying
this kid's spine

245
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,890
is to find the answer
some other way.

246
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,090
All the tests were negative.

247
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,530
We need a better history.

248
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,120
How much more paperwork
do you need?

249
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,930
We've got pediatric records,
a few dozen ER records,

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,340
our own admission
questionnaire.

251
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,070
What's the first question?

252
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,840
Insurance coverage.

253
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,210
Okay, second question.

254
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,940
Just make your point.

255
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,210
"Where does it hurt?"

256
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,420
If we knew where it hurt,
we could diagnose her.

257
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,680
You do know CIPA means
she can't feel pain.

258
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,590
No, CIPA means she's
insensitive to pain.

259
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,130
She still has
scattered nerve fibers
that could conduct pain,

260
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,560
but the signals don't make
it to the brain.

261
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,160
What if we give her more
pain signals,
a lot more pain signals?

262
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,000
Maybe some of them
will make it through.

263
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,330
You want to torture her?

264
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,270
No.

265
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,240
Yes, we do this
to anybody else, it's torture.

266
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,240
Doing it to her
is no different
than pricking a finger.

267
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,210
We keep poking sharp sticks
into her,

268
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,840
eventually we'll find the part
that's already tender.

269
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,610
So what does
a Dean of Medicine do?

270
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,120
Oh, can we please
not talk about that?

271
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,250
I will talk about
anything else. I'm just trying
to get away from work.

272
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,560
Metaphorically,
because geographically,
the coffee place

273
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,760
around the corner from
the hospital probably isn't
the furthest you could get.

274
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,270
Well, the snow!

275
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,400
The roads are clearing,

276
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,600
but it's a good place
to beat a retreat from.

277
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,640
You usually expect
your dates to go wrong?

278
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,880
Experience has taught me
to have an escape route.

279
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,510
Well, low expectations,
that's in my favor.

280
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,630
Whatever happens,
I need you to understand

281
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,500
that there are
certain aspects to my life
I'm not happy about.

282
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,330
Need a nerve biopsy.

283
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,500
And you had to come here
personally to tell me that?

284
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,130
And how did you even know
I was here?

285
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,200
I had to bring the file,

286
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,240
and this was the most
noncommittal location
in walking distance.

287
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,780
You left your car keys
in your desk. Greg House.

288
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,950
You two must have met online.

289
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,250
Either that,
or you've got a friend
who secretly hates you.

290
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,860
Don Herrick.

291
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,730
Yeah, we connected through
SingleBallroomDanceLovers. Com.

292
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,830
Why would he volunteer
that information?

293
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,170
Why would I hide it?

294
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,770
You didn't tell him that
anything he said would be
held against you?

295
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,810
So what line of work
are you in?

296
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,180
Auto maintenance,
changing oil and filters.

297
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,120
Great, 'cause my place
overcharges. Can't trust
anything you guys say.

298
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,210
Where are you located?

299
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,310
In 14 states.
I own Eastern Lube.

300
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,890
Most CIPA complications
are infection,
and she's got a fever.

301
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,090
LP? Urine?

302
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,690
Clean. Normal.

303
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,670
Same with
the white-blood-cell count.

304
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,670
Cancer?
Nothing on the scan.

305
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,040
I think it's her nerves
messing with
the temperature control.

306
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,870
Amyloid, sarcoid,
there's a lot of candidates.

307
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,430
I want a biopsy.

308
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,310
Fine, if that's what
you need, go get it.

309
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,790
(LOUDLY) He seems a lot nicer
than that one from
WiccaNeedsADaddyFigure. Com.

310
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,100
CHASE: One of these is warm,

311
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,140
and the other is very hot.

312
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,770
Start here.
Move to the hot one.
Just a few seconds, then back.

313
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,250
We're gonna monitor activity
in your brain while you do it.

314
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,880
If you feel any response
to the heat, it could
indicate a vascular problem.

315
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
How's my mom doing?

316
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,360
<i>She's okay.</i>
<i>Do you feel anything?</i>

317
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,390
No.

318
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,230
What does "okay" mean?

319
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,490
<i>She's still in surgery.</i>

320
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,040
They tell me it's going okay.

321
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,730
<i>Can you take your hand out?</i>

322
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,170
And you didn't
ask anything else?

323
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,330
Take your hand
out of the water.

324
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,380
What's going on
with my mother?

325
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,680
Hannah!

326
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,550
You just got
second-degree burns.

327
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,480
I'll be fine. What's going on
with my mother?
Is she gonna die?

328
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,920
They said she's okay.
Surgery this long

329
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,460
is typical when there are
internal injuries.

330
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,960
FOREMAN: Naloxone and
kinase proteins in.

331
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,130
And that's gonna make
me feel pain?

332
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,670
I didn't feel anything when
you guys screwed this thing
into my head.

333
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,230
It'll replace missing
chemicals in your nerves,
heighten sensitivity.

334
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,610
We're gonna be drilling
directly into your skull.

335
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,310
A response should
indicate sarcoma.

336
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,040
What does it feel like?

337
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,110
It hurts.

338
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,340
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,250
Bone pain is the worst
there is, so you need

340
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,790
to let me know as soon
as you feel anything.

341
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,260
She's ready.

342
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,200
So, what, I just sit here
while you guys
drill a hole in me?

343
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,300
You wanna talk?

344
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,270
Just you and your mom, huh?
You two must be pretty close.

345
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,750
We were, until I got arrested.
Third time.

346
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,980
Drugs?
Fights.

347
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,740
You got an advantage.

348
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,410
Not really.
Never know when to stop.

349
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,550
You piss a lot of people off,
or are you just trying to
piss off your mom?

350
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,920
Those are pretty much
the only two choices you have.

351
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,890
Hannah? You want us to stop?
Stop the drill!
Stop the drill!

352
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,160
(SCREAMING)

353
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,220
It's okay. What did you feel?

354
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,050
Where did you feel it?
Hannah, I need to know
how it hurt.

355
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,060
Hannah!

356
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,440
I am so tired of this.
Did you know

357
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,340
that the new nurse from
Cardiology is sleeping
with that weird lawyer

358
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,430
from the board?

359
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,270
The guy with 11 fingers?

360
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,330
He has 11 fingers?

361
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,380
How do you not notice that?

362
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,710
The nurse used to be a man.

363
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,080
She's not anymore?
But we can't talk about that.

364
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,020
I thought we were.
We were supposed
to talk about that.

365
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,550
I came here to talk
about that, but on the way up,
I ran into Cameron.

366
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,090
You've got a CIPA patient?

367
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,920
Tranny nurse
is more interesting.

368
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,400
Oh, it's way more interesting,
but instead I've got to be
your damn conscience.

369
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,930
I'm tired of being your
conscience. I don't enjoy
being your conscience.

370
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
No one enjoys...
You're studying her.

371
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,060
She's actually sick.

372
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,330
Which you found out
after you took her on.

373
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,500
I was curious.
Since I'm not a cat,
that's not dangerous.

374
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,980
I don't think that metaphor
was designed to actually
warn cats.

375
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,180
You don't care
about her illness.
You care about CIPA,

376
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,520
which means your focus is
gonna be on getting
your answers, not hers.

377
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,180
Thank you.
Forewarned is forearmed.

378
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,050
What do you think
you're gonna figure out?

379
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,960
Do you think her lack of pain
is somehow the answer
to your pain?

380
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,620
I think if you'd stop
talking to Cameron,

381
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,860
then right now we could be
ranking nurses
in order of do-ability.

382
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,700
I need you.
What did
the nerve biopsy show?

383
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,100
Never did it.
Well, then do it.

384
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,500
Can't.
Why?

385
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,080
She's gonna jump off
the lobby balcony.

386
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,940
You think I can catch her?

387
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,210
Get away from me!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

388
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,880
Yes, you are.
You're just jealous
I can do anything.

389
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,850
Hannah, you're having
a paranoid delusion.

390
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,050
I don't believe you.

391
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,420
Did you think she would?

392
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,820
This is real.
You want me to be in pain.
You even said so.

393
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,520
If we wanted to hurt you,
we'd let you jump.

394
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
Just let me see my mother.

395
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,160
Fine, we'll take you
to our OR observation room.

396
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,170
I don't believe you!
Your mother is fine.

397
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,330
I just spoke to her surgeon.
I don't believe you!

398
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,140
Hannah, what do you
want from us?
What do you want us to do?

399
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,600
I can't feel my legs.

400
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,870
You're trying to pull
the same stunt
twice in 10 minutes.

401
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,580
I'm not pretending.
They don't hurt.
They're just... They're...

402
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,440
Anything?
We're not looking for pain.

403
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,770
Anything at all? Pressure?

404
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,970
Nothing.

405
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,740
You have six broken bones,
a fever, a concussion,
erratic heart rhythms

406
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,440
and a complete lack
of sensation below the waist.

407
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,540
I feel fine.

408
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,250
Is my mother
out of surgery yet?

409
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,650
Not yet.

410
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,110
This is excellent.

411
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,950
The paranoia seems
to have dissipated,

412
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,520
but her vitals keep
getting worse.
She could be dead in hours.

413
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,970
But if you're gonna die
a miserable, lingering death,
pain-free is the way to do it.

414
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,970
Are we sure the fall
didn't cause the paralysis?

415
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,560
The paralysis caused the fall.
Spine's clean.
No vertebral fractures

416
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,110
or spinal cord compression.

417
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,640
Even better.

418
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,700
The nuttiness and paralysis
mean there's definitely
a neurological component.

419
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,150
Could be a nerve disease.

420
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,050
Which is why we need to look
at the nerve that
you didn't biopsy.

421
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,310
There are other tests.

422
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,290
HIV? Syphilis?

423
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,220
She was negative for all STDs.
Vascular?
No, ANA was negative.

424
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,320
Cerebral clot? No, MRI was...

425
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,020
Thyroid storm.

426
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,830
Makes sense given her
glucose reaction was slow,
and potassium's down.

427
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,300
Yeah, I'll check with
an endocrinologist.

428
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,610
Bennett's on call.

429
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,840
Perfect.

430
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,580
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

431
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,550
No.
Need a consult.

432
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,720
I already okayed
your nerve biopsy.

433
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,290
Need an endocrinologist.

434
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,350
Bennett's on call.

435
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,560
Won't pick up.

436
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,970
His cell phone must be broken.

437
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,470
Mine's working.

438
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,100
Had to give you the file.

439
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,270
I assume you're thinking
thyroid storm. Have you
done a hormone panel?

440
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,840
Normal.
TSH was on the low side.

441
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,250
Is that a cheery fire
I hear crackling nearby?

442
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,050
No, what about CPK enzymes?

443
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,780
Elevated, 275.

444
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,490
People light fires
for themselves,
but then they don't deny it.

445
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,060
He's here?

446
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,390
CPK isn't high enough.

447
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,870
Potassium's what
you'd expect because of
the bronchodilators.

448
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, my God!
You're not wearing a bra.

449
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,470
It's not thyroid storm.

450
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,600
You just met him.

451
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,870
I like him,

452
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,540
and I like sex.
Do I need to stitch
a letter on my tops?

453
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,280
No. Might be worth
taking out an ad
in the local papers.

454
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,890
Do you like me, House?

455
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,230
I was on the phone
with Bennett 15 minutes ago.
His cell phone's working.

456
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,390
Your MO is to avoid me
at all costs,

457
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,490
and suddenly you need my input
on every move you make.
I can only assume

458
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,940
it's because I'm on a date.

459
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,170
When we met, I noticed...

460
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,730
You noticed he was a Shriner
because of the way
he parted his hair.

461
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,370
You noticed he was a mama's
boy because of the way
he blinked his left eye.

462
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,940
I'm not interested.
I'm not impressed.

463
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,040
There are only two reasons
anyone would want to
screw with me tonight.

464
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,850
Either they're an
altruistic decent person

465
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,910
who's worried about
my well-being, or they
want me for themselves.

466
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,560
You left out the third option.

467
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,120
Evil bastard who just wants
to mess with
other people's happiness.

468
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,070
Good night, House.

469
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,910
We won't be bothered again.

470
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,960
It's late. I should go.

471
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,150
Why?

472
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,990
I part my hair on the left,
and I'm a Shriner?

473
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,790
You heard the conversation?

474
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm not interested in him.

475
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,260
I don't blame you.

476
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,570
I only said those things
so that he wouldn't come back.

477
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,570
I don't really care
about my job. I do it well.

478
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,980
I provide a service,
but my goal was always
to make enough money

479
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,680
to do the things
I really like.
Music, travel...

480
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,850
I like those things, too.

481
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,380
You like them,
but they're not
really important to you.

482
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,950
I don't know whether
it's House, your job, or
you just thrive on conflict,

483
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,830
but you should hear yourself
when you're talking to him.

484
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,970
Nothing else in the world's
going on. You're focused,
confident, compelling.

485
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,950
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'd like to go out
with that woman.

486
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,650
I can get her on the phone.

487
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,500
Where did you go?
She's getting worse.

488
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,470
It's not thyroid storm.
Give me a spinal nerve.

489
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,100
There are still other tests.

490
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,580
She just said
the girl is getting worse.

491
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,640
You really want to wait?

492
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,350
CAMERON: We'll be risking
infection, maybe make
the paralysis worse.

493
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,760
It is worse, and we're
making it worse than worse?
Do the biopsy.

494
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,320
We could paralyze her
and get no useful information.

495
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,760
Do the biopsy.

496
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,200
If you're thinking
peripheral neuropathy,

497
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,030
we should take a nerve
a little further away
from the spine.

498
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,660
A little further
from the truth.
We're talking paralysis.

499
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,860
There's a good chance
the spine is relevant.

500
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,100
If this thing is progressing,
it could kill her in hours.

501
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,410
Give me back my papers.

502
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,110
Is he asking
for a spinal nerve?

503
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,710
How did you know?

504
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,050
Give us a minute.

505
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,390
Did you know they recently
found a protein that
speeds up nerve growth?

506
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,190
Fascinating stuff.
If you put that protein

507
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,960
with the insulation
from a spinal nerve,

508
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,900
you could grow your
own little garden.
If that spinal nerve...

509
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
if it happened to come
from a person with CIPA,

510
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,470
I can grow pain-free nerves
and graft them into my own
leg. What an evil plan!

511
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,840
You'd have to be
on immunosuppressors for life.

512
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,970
Risk of infection,
shorter lifespan...

513
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,950
Shorter but normal.

514
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,410
Usually jealousy expresses
itself by trying to destroy
what someone has.

515
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,220
You're more ambitious.
You actually want to
change medical fact

516
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,380
to get this thing...

517
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,090
Medical fact
changes all the time.

518
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,490
You're risking
your patient's life.

519
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,360
That's how medical fact
changes.

520
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,460
A doctor risks...

521
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,800
To serve their
patient's health,

522
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,890
not their own.

523
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,230
This is medically justified.

524
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,830
Are you sure? Are you sure
that you're the right one
to be making this call?

525
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,950
Biopsy whatever nerve
you figure you could
safely get at.

526
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,560
God, Wilson's annoying.

527
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,290
Past 3:00 a.m.
On Valentine's Day night.

528
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,860
I assume you had
a date with Wendy.

529
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,900
She'll survive.
She knows the deal.

530
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,100
You're lucky.
I know.

531
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,640
Someday, when there's time,
I would like to actually
have a social life.

532
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,040
Someday? Come on.

533
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,980
If there's one thing
a good-looking woman
can have whenever she wants,

534
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,070
it's a social life.

535
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,740
You mean a sex life.

536
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,950
There's nothing wrong
with a little companionship

537
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,350
until the real thing
comes along.

538
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,650
I had the real thing.

539
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,190
Forgive me
if I don't want to settle.

540
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,820
Right.
What does that mean?

541
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,450
Nothing.

542
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,520
You think I didn't have
the real thing?

543
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,930
I have no idea what you had.

544
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,870
And yet you're judging it.

545
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,410
It's late. I'm cranky. Sorry.

546
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,030
I didn't have the real thing.

547
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,340
How could you even know?

548
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,350
You married a dying man.

549
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,580
You thought,
"Six months, a year,
it'll be tough,

550
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,120
"but then I'll recover,
and I'll have
the rest of my life."

551
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:57,210
It's like willingly getting
the flu or joining
the Peace Corps, short-term.

552
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,690
Wow, you nailed it.
It's basically like
a wasted weekend.

553
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,890
The sacrifices you made were
huge, but they were at the
height of your love for him.

554
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,430
Commitment is only commitment
because it has no
expiration date.

555
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,170
You stand next to someone
and watch them floss for
30 years like my parents have,

556
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,680
then ask for sacrifices.
That's how you know
the real thing.

557
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,790
Cameron, I wasn't
criticizing you.

558
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,900
People who avoid commitment
are people who know
what a big thing it is.

559
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,530
This isn't right.

560
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,280
CIPA can't cause
this much degeneration.

561
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,580
A few nerve fibers we
teased out of the center
have some insulation left,

562
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,280
but the insulation
around the bundles
has been stripped bare.

563
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,380
Means the damage
must be coming
from the outside in.

564
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,390
Which means it's secondary
demyelination, which means
the source is somewhere else,

565
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,120
which tells us it's not
a nerve disease.

566
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,390
It's something systemic
that's affecting the nerves,

567
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,260
which means that we need to...

568
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,100
Where are you going?

569
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,040
Kid's mom is
finally out of surgery.

570
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,640
I'll be right back.

571
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,270
So what?

572
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,750
Hannah should see her.

573
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,910
Yes, immediately after
we're done chatting
about saving her life.

574
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,480
Most likely causes
are metabolic.

575
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,490
They found brain swelling.
They're prepping her mother
for another surgery.

576
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,390
Again, so what?
Get a nurse to take the kid.

577
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,090
There are more
than 60 different
metabolic conditions

578
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,570
that could account for what
she's got. There's only
three of you guys.

579
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,160
She's scared.
She should be.

580
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,970
She'll die if
we don't diagnose her.

581
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,730
So diagnose her.

582
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,120
Mom?

583
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,330
How bad is it? Are you okay?

584
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,350
I'm okay, Mom.

585
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,650
I'll get better.
I always get better.

586
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,450
Are you checking yourself,
your temperature?

587
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:46,090
Mom, could you just let it go?
You shouldn't be worrying.

588
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,760
Baby, I'm sorry.

589
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,820
I should have seen
that car coming.

590
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,360
No, Mom, I did this
to myself. I screwed up.

591
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:02,340
You were right.
You were right,
and I was wrong.

592
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,170
No. No.

593
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,380
I shouldn't have gone out
on the ice. I shouldn't
have fallen down,

594
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,050
and I shouldn't have made you
rush me to an ER
for the 10th time this year.

595
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,190
(MONITOR BEEPING)

596
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,660
Mom?

597
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,660
Mom?
You okay?

598
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,270
They have to take her
back to surgery.

599
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,070
Hannah, your BP is way up.
We need to get you some rest.

600
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,010
My hand's wet.

601
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,810
You're crying.

602
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,410
I can't cry.

603
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,290
My head's killing me.

604
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,900
So what does the pain tell us?

605
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,960
No tingling or itching,
so we can rule out...

606
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,980
It tells us nothing.
It wasn't physical pain.
It was emotional.

607
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,280
Exactly. What were they doing
when she got the headache?

608
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,410
Saying goodbye.

609
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,950
You said they were arguing.

610
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,110
They weren't really arguing.
She was just frustrated.

611
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,650
What were they arguing about?

612
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,280
Whose fault it was.

613
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,390
Peripheral neuropathy,
fever and intermittent
paranoia.

614
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,060
Lots of metabolic conditions
can explain those things.
What if we add guilt?

615
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,630
Guilt? As a symptom?

616
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,070
Alzheimer's can
cause euphoria,
pain causes depression,

617
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,470
and B12 deficiency
causes guilt, along with
all that other stuff.

618
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,510
If she felt guilty, she
wouldn't be making her
mother's life miserable.

619
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,410
She wouldn't be getting
in fights, getting arrested.

620
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,680
Maybe she's fighting
because she feels guilty.

621
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,240
She's showing her mom
she can take stupid risks
and still be safe.

622
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,380
Means mom can let go.

623
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,720
CHASE: Which is rational.

624
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,810
If guilt is a symptom,
it's caused by the illness,

625
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,190
not by a thought process,
and it would have to be new.

626
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,730
Couple years ago,
she was a model student.

627
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,730
This is pointless.
If the headache
was caused by guilt,

628
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,230
she has a B12 deficiency.

629
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,290
If it's just because
she was sad,
it's meaningless.

630
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,630
How the hell do we
test for that?

631
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,830
We don't.

632
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Give her a shot of B12.
When she gets better,
I was right.

633
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:18,100
We already did.
ER gave her B12 when
she was admitted,

634
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,080
part of a multivitamin
supplement.
Apparently, she's just sad.

635
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,490
Why are you still here?

636
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,120
Trying to get a couple pages
into a drug trial.
Paperwork's due tomorrow.

637
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,290
Why are you here?

638
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,330
Still haven't figured out why.

639
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,760
No, I meant here,
in my office.

640
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:44,460
Just dumped a cool B12 theory.
Moved on to leukemia.

641
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,330
Very pedestrian.

642
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,870
I'm not happy.

643
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,050
Her white-blood-cell
count was low.

644
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,910
The ones she's got,
it's just a lot of
eosinophils.

645
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,280
The immunoglobulin
E-level's borderline.

646
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,820
If you want to be 100% sure,
check the bone marrow.

647
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,410
The team's doing
a biopsy right now.

648
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,420
It turns out the
weird lawyer knew

649
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,990
that she used to be a man.

650
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,260
And he's cool with that?

651
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,930
Turns out that his
previous girlfriend
also used to be a man.

652
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,660
Yeah.

653
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,710
Is it possible for you
to just watch me eat,

654
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,920
or do you get some primeval
thrill out of beating
the other hunters to the food?

655
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,190
See you later.

656
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,900
You still haven't figured out
that I don't need sedation?

657
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,900
It's so you don't move
during the procedure.

658
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,900
Is that nitrous?
What, are you
trying to kill her?

659
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,940
We gave her nitrous
during the EEG.

660
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,410
That's what made this thing
rear its ugly...

661
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,640
What thing?

662
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,910
B12 deficiency.

663
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,110
Are you having déja vu?

664
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,280
We've had this conversation.
She was given B12.
She didn't get better.

665
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,880
Because someone else ate it.
Get an abdominal MRI.

666
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,290
What? What are you doing?
Don't touch me!

667
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,190
Don't touch me!
See? There's she goes.

668
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,460
Don't touch me!
Another paranoid delusion.

669
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,160
At the rate she's going
downhill, forget the MRI.
We need an OR.

670
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,300
Leave me alone!

671
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,000
Occupied!

672
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,230
Her hernia can wait.

673
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,040
Help! They're trying
to kill me!

674
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:33,480
Okay, you can either believe
that we really are
trying to kill her,

675
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,180
or you can assume
she's suffering from
a medical condition.

676
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,840
Seeing as this is a hospital,
and we're all dressed
like doctors,

677
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,780
and there are easier ways
to kill somebody...

678
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,120
Bev, help them.
I'm gonna need iodine,

679
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,180
scalpel numbers 10 and 15,
forceps and a largish
salad bowl.

680
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,530
Okay, hold her down.

681
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,270
Come on, weenie,
she's in a cast.

682
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,470
Swab.

683
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,440
Fifteen.

684
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,070
You're not gonna
anesthetize her?

685
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,410
Relax.
It's just a magic trick.

686
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,640
(SCREAMING)

687
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,120
She's faking it.
We're not falling
for it this time.

688
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,090
Okay, keep that retracted.

689
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,030
Forceps.

690
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,850
Lake fishing can be fun.
It can bring the generations
together.

691
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,580
But if you don't cook
that trout or perch well,

692
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,680
you'll be giving
room and board to this fellow,

693
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,990
and by "free board,"
I mean all the B12
you can take in.

694
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,790
I could have a tapeworm in me?

695
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,390
Not likely.
You'd be in a lot of pain.

696
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,530
It's gotta be 25 feet long.

697
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,580
Damn it.
World record's over 60.

698
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,010
Hannah, wake up.
Somebody here to see you.

699
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,030
She's got limited motion
on her left side.

700
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,360
You might have
to take care of her
for a while.

701
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,660
You don't feel it,
but you're about to rip
your stitches out.

702
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,070
Take care of yourself.
Then you can take care of her.

703
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,580
You haven't gone home.

704
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,990
Sorry I screwed up
Valentine's day.

705
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,430
I'm dating a doctor.
I'd be an idiot
to expect anything else.

706
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,590
I did get you a gift. MGH.

707
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,370
Best teaching hospital
in Boston.

708
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,340
You want to be
a nurse practitioner?
That's as good as it gets.

709
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,510
I made a few calls,
and you're in if you want in.

710
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,740
This is why you've been
helping me get my surgical
hours for accreditation.

711
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,120
I thought you wanted...
Stupid.

712
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,620
You've got 10 feet of
personal space around you.

713
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,160
I step forward, you step back.

714
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,960
I've shared
a lot of things with you.

715
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,190
Which is why
you're breaking up with me.

716
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,270
You can't stand to be close.

717
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,030
Wendy, you think
I'll stay with you
because you're angry with me?

718
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,770
I'm upset

719
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,280
because I care.

720
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,720
Only you'd expect
an argument to be rational,

721
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,250
you and that
ass boss of yours.

722
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,240
Well, you could ask her
for the spinal nerve.

723
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,810
She's got no reason
to give it.

724
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,110
She owes you.

725
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,720
The hospital will
send her a bill.

726
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,720
I'm just saying, if you want
to do it, do it while
her B12 is still low.

727
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,890
Guilt can be your friend.

728
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,960
Breakfast?

729
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,530
Yeah.

730
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,840
Happy Valentine's Day.

731
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,540
Holiday that only applies
to people who are
already paired up.

732
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,640
For everyone else,
it's Wednesday.

733
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,020
Wow, thank you for
that dash of cold water.

734
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,390
Don't get me wrong.
I still think true love's
out there.

735
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,860
It's just very far away,
possibly in another galaxy.

736
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,120
We may need to develop
faster-than-light travel

737
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,290
before we can make contact.

738
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,890
So I'm thinking
we should have sex.

739
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:25,670
That makes sense.

740
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,040
Despite the wisdom
of pop songs,

741
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,100
there's no point putting
our lives on hold
until love comes along.

742
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,980
We're both healthy and
busy people. We work together
so it's convenient.

743
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,610
Like microwave pizza.

744
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,840
And of all the people
I work with,

745
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,720
you're the one
I'm least likely
to fall in love with.

746
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,980
Like microwave pizza.

747
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,890
The point here is to
make things simpler,
not more complicated.

748
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,550
Someday, there'll be time
to get serious about someone.

749
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,190
Meanwhile, we already had
sex once and didn't
get weird about it, so...

750
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,600
I get it. I get it.
So what if I'm offended
by your judgment?

751
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,040
Then you're not the man
I'm looking for.
