1
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:04,767
Sam, starring as Lucifer.
Dean, starring as Michael.

2
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,967
You're gonna suck it up,
except your responsibility's

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,960
and play the roles that
destiny has chosen for you.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,190
- Why doesn't a stake kill you?
- I am the Trickster.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,290
Or maybe, you're not.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,590
- Castiel: Hello Gabriel.
- Sam: The arch angel?

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,590
This isn't about some prize
fight, between your brothers.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,090
This is about you, being to
afraid to stand up to your family.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,990
- You gonna do something stupid?
- Like what?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,790
- Like, Michael... stupid?
- Come on, Sam.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,590
Things are about
to get really bad.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,590
The people I'm going
to see next... they're not

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,790
gonna get anything from me, without
agreeing to a few conditions.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,790
Whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't do it.

15
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:38,967
I have to.

16
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:40,402
You're finally ready, right?

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,603
You know there's no other choice.

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,737
There's never been a choice.

19
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:43,905
The answer is yes.

20
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:47,308
Dean.

21
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:48,777
Of course, I have
a few conditions.

22
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:53,114
- What changed your mind?
- The damnedest thing.

23
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:54,249
I mean, the world's ending,

24
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:55,784
the walls are
coming down on us.

25
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:57,252
I just didn't want
to let you down.

26
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:58,486
So screw destiny.

27
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:00,622
I say we take the fight to them,
do it our way.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,761
Hello?

29
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:07,421
Hello?

30
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:33,248
Hiya.

31
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:34,782
Buddy, you can't be here.

32
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,017
'Course I can.

33
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:37,852
Someone's got to
get everything ready.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,522
They're coming... all of them.

35
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:44,459
And we've each got
our part to play.

36
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:45,426
Even you.

37
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:46,561
What?

38
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,229
You're dinner.

39
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:50,899
No!

40
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,167
Aah! Aah!

41
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:58,935
Season 5 Episode 19
"Hammer of the Gods"

42
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:13,821
Phew.

43
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:26,668
Nice digs, for once.

44
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:35,977
Busy night.

45
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:38,079
Any port in a storm, I guess.

46
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:40,281
If you could just
fill this out, please.

47
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:41,215
Yeah.

48
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,920
Sir, I think
you got a little...

49
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:47,255
shaving nick there.

50
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:56,464
Your key.

51
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:57,966
Oh. Thanks.

52
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:00,168
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
a coffee shop, would you?

53
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:03,004
Buffet. All you can eat.

54
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:05,873
Best pie in the
tri-state area.

55
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,509
You don't say?

56
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:15,750
Heaven, right?

57
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,287
Trust me, pal... better.

58
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:33,635
How you doing?

59
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:34,636
No.

60
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,000
- But...
- No.

61
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:39,974
Oh, lady, I'm just... you know...

62
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,576
I understand.

63
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:43,811
And no.

64
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:48,282
10-4. Copy.

65
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,860
Sam, unpucker, man. Eat something.

66
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:00,561
We should hit the road, Dean.

67
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,030
In this storm?
What? I-it's...

68
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:03,464
It's biblical. Exactly.

69
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:07,201
I-it's friggin' Noah's ark
out there, and we're eating pie.

70
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,937
How many hours of sleep
did you get this week?

71
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,774
What... three, four?

72
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:14,308
Bobby's got his
feelers out, okay?

73
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:15,910
We have talked
with every hoodoo man

74
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:17,245
and root woman in 12 States.

75
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,680
Yeah, well, I'm not giving up.

76
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:19,881
Nobody's giving up.

77
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,385
Especially me.

78
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:28,356
We're gonna find a way
to beat the devil, okay?

79
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:29,590
Soon. I can feel it.

80
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:31,392
And we will find Cass,
we'll find Adam.

81
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,561
But you are no
good to me burnt out.

82
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,534
Yeah.

83
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:40,935
Yeah, okay.

84
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:42,937
Come on. We've actually
got the night off for once.

85
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,540
Let's try to enjoy it.

86
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,031
Oh, what are you, 12?

87
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,265
I'm young at heart.

88
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:17,305
Wow. Look at this.

89
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:19,841
We're like Rockefellers.

90
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:21,242
Chocolates!

91
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:24,946
You want yours?

92
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:26,280
Knock yourself out.

93
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:31,385
Whoa.

94
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,788
"Casa Erotica 13" on demand.

95
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:35,890
What?

96
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,525
Isn't this place kind of...

97
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:39,527
in the middle of nowhere?

98
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:41,696
So?

99
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:45,366
So what's a four-star hotel
doing on a no-star highway?

100
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:03,317
Hello?

101
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:12,160
Hello?

102
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:32,780
The, uh, the
room next to ours...

103
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:34,682
th-the couple that are, uh,
joined at the lips...

104
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,883
have you seen them?

105
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:39,353
Mr. And Mrs. Logan...
the honeymooners?

106
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,856
They checked out.

107
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:43,658
Is something the matter?

108
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:44,926
They checked out?

109
00:07:44,993 --> 00:07:46,961
Mm-hmm.
Mm, just now.

110
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,196
Really?

111
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:49,764
It sort of seemed like
they were, um...

112
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:52,466
in the middle of something.

113
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:53,935
Yeah, it's kind of weird
for honeymooners

114
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:55,536
to, uh, check out without this.

115
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:56,904
Oh, dear.

116
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:59,607
I'll just put that
right in the lost and found.

117
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:00,908
Don't you worry.

118
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:03,411
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

119
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:05,146
Uh, no.
No, we're good.

120
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:06,480
Super-fantastic.

121
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,954
Creepy.

122
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,523
Broke the needle.

123
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:17,959
All right, well, I'll
scope out the joint,

124
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:20,661
and you keep an eye
on Norman Bates over here.

125
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:21,896
I mean, one night off...

126
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:23,197
is that too much to ask?

127
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,749
This ain't no peep show, man!

128
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,459
You're beautiful.

129
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:28,129
You're sweet.

130
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:29,830
I hate sweet.

131
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:32,867
Sorry to interrupt.

132
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:34,535
The last guest just arrived.

133
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:35,836
So everything's ready?

134
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:37,104
As it will ever be.

135
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:38,873
Pantry's full.

136
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,841
And the Winchesters?

137
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,577
Suspicious, but under control.

138
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:45,112
You have their blood?

139
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,314
Of course I do.

140
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,381
I'm quick.

141
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:53,287
Boys never even knew
what hit them.

142
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:55,156
Thank you, Mercury.

143
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:58,259
Okay. Let's get this
show on the road.

144
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:02,430
- An elephant?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:03,731
Like, an elephant?

146
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,199
Like, full-on Babar.

147
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,768
So what the hell... is...

148
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:12,606
Where is everybody?

149
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:20,548
Let me guess... it's locked.

150
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:23,784
So, what? The roaches check in,
they don't check out?

151
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,920
Think about how we got here.

152
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:27,588
That detour on I-90...

153
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:29,690
the friggin' hurricane?

154
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:33,494
You saying we were led here?

155
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:34,996
Like rats in a maze.

156
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,091
Please be tomato soup.

157
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,292
Please be tomato soup.

158
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,065
Motel hell.

159
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,847
Help us! Get us out!

160
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:31,919
Hurry up!

161
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:35,255
I'm going as fast
as I... as I can.

162
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:36,857
There's somebody behind
me, isn't there?

163
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:10,558
Something tells me this isn't
a Shriner Convention.

164
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:18,399
Dinner is served.

165
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,140
Ladies and gentlemen...

166
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,943
our guests of honor
have arrived.

167
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:38,332
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

168
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,502
Well, in all my centuries,
I never thought I'd see this...

169
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:43,036
this many gods under one roof.

170
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:44,571
Gods?

171
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,374
Now, before we get down to brass
tacks, some ground rules:

172
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:49,443
No slaughtering each other.

173
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,812
Curb your wrath.

174
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,548
Oh, and, uh, keep your hands
off the local virgins...

175
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:57,151
we're trying to keep
a low profile here.

176
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:59,119
Oh, we are so, so screwed.

177
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:01,688
Now, we all know
why we're here.

178
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:04,958
The Judeo-Christian
apocalypse looms over us.

179
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,628
I know we've all had
our little disagreements

180
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,062
in the past,

181
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,998
but the time has come
to put those aside -

182
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,765
and look toward the future.

183
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,370
'Cause if we don't,
we won't have one.

184
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,208
Now, we do have two very
valuable bargaining chips...

185
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:24,211
Michael and Lucifer's vessels.

186
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,380
The question is...

187
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,182
what do we do now?

188
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:30,617
Anybody have any
bright ideas, speak up.

189
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,453
This is a safe room.

190
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:37,958
Oh, I don't like his tone.

191
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,193
Kill them, why?

192
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,228
So the angels here
can bring them back again?

193
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:44,364
I don't know what everybody's
getting so worked up about.

194
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,201
This is just a couple of angels
having a slap fight.

195
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,136
It's no Armageddon.

196
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,572
Everybody knows when the
world comes to an end,

197
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,341
the great serpent
Jörmungandr rises up,

198
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:57,911
and I, myself, will be
eaten by a big wolf.

199
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,550
Oh, yeah... and why is that?

200
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:06,720
Because your beliefs are so
much more realistic?

201
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:09,489
The whole world's
getting carried around

202
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,892
on the back of a giant turtle.

203
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,126
Give me a break.

204
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:16,663
What are you gonna do about it?

205
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,167
You watch your mouth
when you talk to me, boy!

206
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:23,437
No one's ever proved that.

207
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,507
Stay.

208
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:39,019
We have to fight.

209
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:43,857
The archangels, the only thing
they understand is violence.

210
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:48,362
This ends in blood.
There is no other way.

211
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:53,100
It's them... or us.

212
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:57,771
With all due respect... Ma'am...

213
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,940
we haven't even tried
talking to them.

214
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:15,289
Kali.

215
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,458
Who asked you?

216
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:24,164
Can't we all just get along?

217
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:25,299
Gabe...

218
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:29,903
Sam. Dean.

219
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,273
It's always wrong
place, worst time

220
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:34,574
with you mutton-heads, huh?

221
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,509
Loki.

222
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,478
Baldur.

223
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,815
Good seeing you, too.

224
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:44,651
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.

225
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,852
Why are you here?

226
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,387
To talk about the
elephant in the room.

227
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,989
Not you.

228
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:52,059
The Apocalypse.

229
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:54,861
We can't stop it, gang.

230
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,534
But first things first.

231
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,704
The adults need to have
a little conversation.

232
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,172
Check you later.

233
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,777
Okay...

234
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,946
did that...

235
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,014
holy crap.

236
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:15,449
Yeah, tell me about it.

237
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,784
By the way, next time I say
"let's keep driving,"

238
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,853
uh... let's keep driving.

239
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:21,421
Okay, yeah, next time.

240
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,790
Uh, all right, so,
what's our next move?

241
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,158
I-I...

242
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:26,760
I don't know.

243
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:29,262
We grab those poor saps
out of the freezer, I guess...

244
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,597
bust them out.

245
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,299
Gank a few freaks along
the way if we're lucky.

246
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,901
And when are you ever lucky?

247
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,471
Oh, you know what...?
Bite me, Gabriel.

248
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,472
Maybe later, big boy.

249
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,840
I should have known.

250
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,075
I mean, this had your stink
all over it from the jump.

251
00:16:42,143 --> 00:16:44,811
You think I'm behind this?

252
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,012
Please.

253
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,948
I'm the Costner
to your Houston.

254
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:49,716
I'm here to save your ass.

255
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:51,284
You want to pull us
out of the fire?

256
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:52,853
Bingo.

257
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,722
Those gods are either gonna
dust you or use you as bait.

258
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,424
Either way, you're uber-boned.

259
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,092
Wow... 'cause
a couple of months ago,

260
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,395
you were telling us that
we need to play our roles.

261
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:03,597
You were uber-boning us.

262
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:06,633
Ohhhhh, the end is still nigh.

263
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:10,337
Michael and Lucifer
are gonna dance the lambada.

264
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,606
But not tonight...
not here.

265
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:15,642
And why do you care?

266
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,445
I don't care.

267
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,715
But...

268
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,984
me and Kali, we, uh...

269
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,585
had a thing.

270
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,187
Chick was all hands.

271
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,191
What can I say...
I'm sentimental.

272
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,293
Do they have a chance...

273
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:34,428
against Satan?

274
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:35,762
Really, Sam?

275
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,465
You got a better idea, Dean?

276
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,100
It's a bad idea.

277
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:43,437
Lucifer's gonna turn them
into finger paint.

278
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:45,338
So let's get going
while the going's good.

279
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:47,541
Okay, great. Why don't you
just zap us out of here, then?

280
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,809
Would if I could...

281
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,845
but Kali's got you
by the short and curlies.

282
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:54,247
It's a blood spell.

283
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:55,916
You boys are on a leash.

284
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:57,384
What does that mean?

285
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:01,054
Means it's time for a little
of the old black magic.

286
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,255
Ahh.

287
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,356
Okay. Yeah, Well, whatever.

288
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:04,424
We're gonna take
the hors d'oeuvres

289
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:05,525
in the freezer with us.

290
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:07,060
Forget it.

291
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,095
It's gonna be hard enough
sneaking you mooks out of here.

292
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,063
They called you "Loki," right?

293
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,366
Which mean they don't
really know who you are.

294
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:14,935
Told you...
I'm in Witness Protection.

295
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,704
Okay, well, then how about
you do what we say,

296
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:20,740
or we tell the,
uh, legion of doom

297
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,642
about your secret identity?

298
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,478
They don't seem like
a real pro-angel kind of crowd.

299
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,079
I'll take your voices away.

300
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,581
- We'll write it down.
- I'll cut off your hands.

301
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,915
Then people are gonna be asking,

302
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,152
"why are you guys running around
with no hands?"

303
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:36,823
Fine.

304
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:51,171
Bonjour, mon amour.

305
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:53,673
Leave.

306
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,108
You always did
play hard to get.

307
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,710
I've moved on.

308
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:57,944
I noticed.

309
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,746
Baldur...

310
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:01,147
really?

311
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,887
Baldur's uncomplicated.

312
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,455
No!

313
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,724
No, no!

314
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,530
No! No! Stop!

315
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,199
No!

316
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:22,068
It's too late.

317
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,940
I never took you for the type.

318
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,642
Romantic?

319
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,443
Pathetic.

320
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,647
You're the one
who called me here.

321
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:38,251
Because I thought you
might take this seriously.

322
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,853
I'm taking this seriously.

323
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:43,023
Ship's sinking...
time to get off.

324
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,426
I mean, screw this marble.
Let's go check out Pandora.

325
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,828
It doesn't have to be like that.

326
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,567
Afraid it does.

327
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:55,902
If we fight...

328
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,103
You die.

329
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:58,872
And what makes you
such an expert?

330
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,541
I've tussled with those winged
ass-monkeys once or twice.

331
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:05,078
Kali... no more tricks.

332
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:07,747
I'm begging you...
don't do this.

333
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,482
I have to.

334
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,023
Can't blame me for trying.

335
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:20,694
Still love me?

336
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,963
No.

337
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:44,784
Ow!

338
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:53,193
Where the hell is Gabriel?

339
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,296
You must take me for a fool...

340
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:57,697
Gabriel.

341
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:01,968
You're bound to me...
now and forever.

342
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,476
- Ghostfacers!
- Ghostfacers!

343
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:10,977
Ghostfacers

344
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:14,014
We face the ghosts
when the others will not

345
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:17,484
we're the ghost...
Ghostfacers.

346
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,519
They leave the kitchen
when the kitchen gets hot

347
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,324
Is the intern position open?

348
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:26,259
- You're hired!
- Oh! Really?

349
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,628
- See my face... right in your little box?
- Yeah.

350
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:30,830
Okay, my face has got to be
right in your box.

351
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,365
Ghostfacers

352
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:35,568
We face the faces,
we face the ghosts

353
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:38,405
Ghostfacers.

354
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,742
If you're dead,
you better stay dead.

355
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,943
Yep.

356
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,578
'Cause if not,
we're gonna kill you.

357
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,072
How long have you known?

358
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,607
Long enough.

359
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,878
How's the rescue going?

360
00:21:56,945 --> 00:22:00,715
Well, surprise, surprise.

361
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:02,750
The trickster's tricked us.

362
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:04,652
Kali... don't.

363
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,887
You're mine now...

364
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:13,227
and you have
something I want...

365
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:25,973
an archangel's blade.

366
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,412
From the archangel... Gabriel.

367
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:37,885
Okay!

368
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:39,253
Okay!

369
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,721
So I got wings.

370
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,223
Like kotex.

371
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,926
But that doesn't make me
any less right about Lucifer.

372
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:46,327
He's lying.

373
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:47,495
He's a spy.

374
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:49,997
I'm not a spy... I'm a runaway.

375
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:52,433
I'm trying to save you.

376
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:56,370
I know my brother, Kali...

377
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:59,407
he should scare the
living crap out of you.

378
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:01,542
You can't beat him.

379
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,946
I've skipped ahead...
seen how this story ends.

380
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:08,449
Your story... not ours.

381
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:12,753
Westerners... I swear,
the sheer arrogance.

382
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:15,756
You think you're the
only ones on earth?

383
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:19,293
You pillage and you butcher
in your God's name.

384
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,662
But you're not
the only religion.

385
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,432
And he's not the only God.

386
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:28,536
And now you think you can
just rip the planet apart?

387
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:30,438
You're wrong.

388
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:33,507
There are billions of us,

389
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:36,344
and we were here first.

390
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:39,246
If anyone gets to end this world...

391
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:43,618
it's me.

392
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:49,056
I'm sorry.

393
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,881
This is crazy.

394
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:15,082
They can die.

395
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,922
We can kill Lucifer.

396
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:26,027
All right, you
primitive screw-heads...

397
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:27,128
listen up.

398
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:28,629
Are you out of your mind?

399
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,630
I'm out of options.

400
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,867
Now, on any other given day,

401
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:36,103
I'd be doing my damnedest
to, uh, kill you,

402
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:38,039
you filthy, murdering chimps.

403
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:41,575
But, uh, hey...

404
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:43,444
desperate times.

405
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:47,782
So even though
I'd love nothing better

406
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:50,451
than to slit your
throats, you... dicks...

407
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:56,057
I'm gonna help you.

408
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:57,792
I'm gonna help you
ice the devil.

409
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,131
And then we can all get back to
ganking each other, like normal.

410
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,435
You want Lucifer?

411
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:09,837
Well, dude's not
in the yellow pages.

412
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:12,139
But me and Sam,
we can get him here.

413
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:13,741
How?

414
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,744
First, you let
those main courses go.

415
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:18,612
Then we talk.

416
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,716
We can either take
on the devil together...

417
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:23,517
or you lame-ass
bitches can eat me.

418
00:25:27,355 --> 00:25:29,090
Literally.

419
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:30,591
Come on, everybody! Let's go!

420
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,693
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

421
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:34,428
All right. All right.

422
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:37,698
Go! Go! Go!
Get out of here!

423
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:40,801
Psst! Dean!

424
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:41,769
D... don't look at me!

425
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:44,739
Act natural.

426
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,440
Get in.

427
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:54,482
Man, there is nothing natural
about this at all.

428
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:55,750
I thought you were dead.

429
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:57,351
You think I'd give Kali
my real sword?

430
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,385
That thing can kill me.

431
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:01,055
Then what do they have in there?

432
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:02,590
A fake.

433
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:04,759
Made it out of a can
of diet orange slice.

434
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:09,363
So, uh...

435
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:10,865
go snag our blood, would ya?

436
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:12,333
What?

437
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,001
I heard you in there.

438
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:16,504
Kali likes you.
You can get close.

439
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:18,606
Lift the plasma,
then we vamoose.

440
00:26:18,673 --> 00:26:20,808
No.

441
00:26:20,876 --> 00:26:22,476
Hand over the real blade.

442
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:24,311
Better yet, why
don't you sack up

443
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:26,614
and help us take down Lucifer?

444
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:27,715
You can't be serious.

445
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:29,150
Deadly.

446
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,418
Since when are you butt-buddies
with a bunch of monsters?

447
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:33,521
That's all they are
to you, aren't they?

448
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:35,489
All right, you know what?
Sam was right. It's nuts.

449
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,924
But it's the best
idea I've heard.

450
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:38,159
So unless you have
a better one...

451
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,263
Well, good luck with that.

452
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,831
Me, I'm blowing Jonestown.

453
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,966
Those lemmings
want to run off a cliff,

454
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:47,134
that's their business.

455
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,702
I see right through you.
You know that?

456
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,038
The smart-ass shell, the whole
"I could give a crap" thing.

457
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:52,907
Believe me, it
takes one to know one.

458
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:54,375
- That so?
- Yes.

459
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:55,876
And maybe those freaks in there
aren't your blood,

460
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:57,044
but they are your family.

461
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:58,813
They just stabbed me
in the friggin' heart!

462
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,715
Maybe, but you still give a crap
about them, don't you?

463
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:02,983
Dean...

464
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:05,085
Now, they're gonna die
in there without you.

465
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:09,490
I can't kill my brother.

466
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:13,761
"Can't" or "won't"?

467
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:18,532
That's what I thought.

468
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:26,841
So, you're going to
summon Lucifer?

469
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:28,242
Sort of.

470
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,045
I just need you to squeegee
some stuff from my ribs,

471
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:32,580
and he'll come running.

472
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,714
Breaking them would be easier.

473
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,119
Show's over.

474
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:41,922
Sword's a fake.

475
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,592
And Gabriel... he's still kicking.

476
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:47,862
I hate to break it to you,
sister, but you've been tricked.

477
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:56,136
Checking in.

478
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,359
Lucifer.

479
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:04,927
Thanks for coming.

480
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:06,228
Oh, you did right calling me.

481
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:09,365
It's just...

482
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:12,835
the way the talk
is heading in there, it's...

483
00:28:12,903 --> 00:28:14,236
it's insane.

484
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:20,009
You know, I never
understood you pagans.

485
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:22,645
You're such...
petty little things.

486
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:25,047
Always fighting...

487
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:27,116
always happy to sell
out your own kind.

488
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,655
No wonder you forfeited
this planet to us.

489
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:36,125
You are worse than humans.

490
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:38,827
You're worse than demons.

491
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:41,330
And yet you claim to be gods.

492
00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:55,244
And they call me prideful.

493
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:01,383
What's happening?

494
00:29:31,314 --> 00:29:33,215
It's him.

495
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:34,416
How?

496
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:35,551
Does it matter?

497
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:37,653
Shazam us out of
here, would you?

498
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:39,054
We can't.

499
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:43,692
Of course you can't.

500
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:47,296
You didn't say
"mother, may I?"

501
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:50,299
Sam, Dean. Good
to see you again.

502
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,868
Baldur... don't.

503
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:54,236
You think you own the planet?

504
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:58,073
What gives you the right?!

505
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:01,477
No one gives us the right.

506
00:30:03,113 --> 00:30:04,213
We take it.

507
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,841
Are you okay?

508
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:34,076
Not really.

509
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:36,512
Better late than never, huh?

510
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:40,416
Guard this with your life.

511
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:56,365
Lucy...

512
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm home.

513
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:02,204
Not this time.

514
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:11,013
Guys...!

515
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:13,649
Get her out of here.

516
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:18,387
Over a girl.

517
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:20,122
Gabriel, really?

518
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,891
I mean, I knew
you were slumming, but...

519
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,693
I hope you didn't
catch anything.

520
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,230
Lucifer...

521
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:30,432
you're my brother,
and I love you.

522
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,636
But you are a great big bag of dicks.

523
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:36,638
What did you just say to me?

524
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:38,173
Look at yourself.

525
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,042
Boo-hoo.

526
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,478
"Daddy was mean to me, so I'm
gonna smash up all his toys."

527
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:43,712
Watch your tone.

528
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,247
Play the victim all you want.

529
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:48,684
But you and me...
we know the truth.

530
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,488
Dad loved you best.

531
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,857
More than Michael.

532
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:56,859
More than me.

533
00:31:56,926 --> 00:31:59,128
Then he brought
the new baby home,

534
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,996
and you couldn't handle it.

535
00:32:01,064 --> 00:32:05,200
So all this is just
a great big temper tantrum.

536
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:10,105
Time to grow up.

537
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:13,509
I'm not getting in that thing.

538
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:14,543
Just get in the car, princess.

539
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:23,185
Gabriel, if you're
doing this for Michael...

540
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:24,586
Screw him.

541
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,688
If he were standing here,
I'd shiv his ass, too.

542
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:29,691
You disloyal...

543
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,726
Oh, I'm loyal...

544
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:33,228
to them.

545
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:34,296
Who...

546
00:32:34,364 --> 00:32:37,433
these... so-called gods?

547
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,867
- To people, Lucifer.
- Hmm.

548
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,637
People.

549
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:44,740
So you're willing to die
for a pile of cockroaches?

550
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:45,741
Why?

551
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,543
Because dad was right.

552
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:50,179
They are better than us.

553
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:53,015
They are broken,
flawed abortions.

554
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:54,616
Damn right they're flawed.

555
00:32:56,352 --> 00:33:00,055
But a lot of them
try... to do better,

556
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:01,457
to forgive.

557
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,327
And you should see
the spearmint rhino.

558
00:33:07,096 --> 00:33:10,566
I've been riding
the pine a long time,

559
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:12,401
but I'm in the game now.

560
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:16,271
And I'm not on your
side or Michael's.

561
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:20,075
I'm on theirs.

562
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:25,914
Brother, don't make me do this.

563
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:28,150
No one makes us do anything.

564
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,255
I know you think you're doing
the right thing, Gabriel...

565
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:37,059
but I know where
your heart truly lies.

566
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,168
Here.

567
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,642
Amateur hocus-pocus.

568
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,477
Don't forget...

569
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:58,947
you learned all your tricks
from me, little brother.

570
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:42,274
Dear diary...

571
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:45,410
Being a high-powered
business president is super-fun

572
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:47,279
But so exhausting.

573
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,814
Sometimes I just need to relax.

574
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:52,684
I need... Casa Erotica.

575
00:34:54,253 --> 00:34:55,887
Room service.

576
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:57,989
Come in!

577
00:34:58,057 --> 00:35:01,059
Gabriel wanted you to
guard this with your life?

578
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:02,327
Maybe he's a fan.

579
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:03,828
It is a good one.

580
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:08,300
I've got the kielbasa
you ordered.

581
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:11,236
Mmm. Polish?

582
00:35:11,304 --> 00:35:12,637
Hungarian.

583
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:19,144
Ahh!

584
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,746
Ooh!

585
00:35:21,814 --> 00:35:23,415
What the hell's going on?

586
00:35:25,685 --> 00:35:27,485
Sam. Dean.

587
00:35:27,553 --> 00:35:30,989
You're probably wondering
what the hell's going on.

588
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:33,258
Well...

589
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:35,627
if you're watching this...

590
00:35:35,695 --> 00:35:36,761
I'm dead.

591
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:38,463
Oh, please!

592
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:40,398
Stop sobbing.

593
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:42,701
It's embarrassing
for all of us.

594
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:46,905
Without me, you've got
zero shot at killing Lucifer.

595
00:35:46,973 --> 00:35:48,506
Sorry.

596
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:49,941
But...

597
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:51,576
you can trap him.

598
00:35:51,644 --> 00:35:55,513
The cage you sprung Lucifer
from is still down there.

599
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:59,551
And maybe... just maybe...
you can shove his ass back in.

600
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:02,053
Not that it'll be easy.

601
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:05,056
You got to get the cage open,
trick my bro back into it...

602
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:08,093
and, uh... oh, yeah...

603
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,061
avoid Michael
and the God squad.

604
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:14,099
But hey, details, right?

605
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,101
And here's the big secret

606
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:18,770
Lucifer himself
doesn't even know.

607
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:21,940
But the key to the cage...
it's out there.

608
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:25,377
Actually, it's keys... plural.

609
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:26,845
Four keys.

610
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:28,947
Well, four rings...

611
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:30,749
from the horsemen.

612
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:33,551
You get them all,
you got the cage.

613
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,720
Can't say I'm
betting on you boys.

614
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:38,323
But, uh, hey,
I've been wrong before.

615
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:41,393
And, Dean...

616
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,994
you were right.

617
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:44,796
I was afraid to
stand up to my brother.

618
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:48,900
Not anymore.

619
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:52,037
So this is me standing up.

620
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:54,005
And this is me...

621
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:56,207
lying down.

622
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:01,646
Ooh!

623
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:03,114
Oh! Oh, man.

624
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:07,252
Horsemen, huh?

625
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:10,655
Well, we got War's,

626
00:37:14,393 --> 00:37:15,493
we nicked Famine's.

627
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:20,332
That's two rings down.
Collect all four.

628
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,866
All we need is,
Pestilence and Death.

629
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,034
Oh, is that all?

630
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,603
It's a plan.

631
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,492
What the hell?

632
00:38:29,335 --> 00:38:31,970
Does this stuff
make you drowsy?

633
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:34,172
I got a lot of driving to do.

634
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,274
Blue ones make you sleepy.

635
00:38:36,342 --> 00:38:39,511
Red and orange ones
are okay for daytime.

636
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:48,253
This is... this is awful.
