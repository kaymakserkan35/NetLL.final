00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,292
Please be tomato soup.

186
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,065
Motel hell.

187
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,847
Help us! Get us out!

188
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:31,919
Hurry up!

189
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:35,255
I'm going as fast
as I... as I can.

190
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:36,857
There's somebody behind
me, isn't there?

191
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:39,493
[both grunting]

192
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:10,558
Something tells me this isn't
a Shriner Convention.

193
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:18,399
Dinner is served.

194
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,935
[applause]

195
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,140
Ladies and gentlemen...

196
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,943
our guests of honor
have arrived.

197
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:38,332
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

198
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,502
Well, in all my centuries,
I never thought I'd see this...

199
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:43,036
this many gods under one roof.

200
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:44,571
Gods?

201
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,374
Now, before we get down to brass
tacks, some ground rules:

202
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:49,443
No slaughtering each other.

203
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,812
Curb your wrath.

204
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,548
Oh, and, uh, keep your hands
off the local virgins...

205
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:57,151
we're trying to keep
a low profile here.

206
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:59,119
Oh, we are so, so screwed.

207
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:01,688
Now, we all know
why we're here.

208
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:04,958
The Judeo-Christian
apocalypse looms over us.

209
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,628
I know we've all had
our little disagreements

210
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,062
in the past,

211
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,998
but the time has come
to put those aside -

212
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,765
and look toward the future.

213
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,370
'Cause if we don't,
we won't have one.

214
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,208
Now, we do have two very
valuable bargaining chips...

215
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:24,211
Michael and Lucifer's vessels.

216
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,380
The question is...

217
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,182
what do we do now?

218
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:30,617
Anybody have any
bright ideas, speak up.

219
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,453
This is a safe room.

220
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:37,958
Oh, I don't like his tone.

221
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,193
Kill them, why?

222
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,228
So the angels here
can bring them back again?

223
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:44,364
Odin:
I don't know what everybody's
getting so worked up about.

224
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,201
This is just a couple of angels
having a slap fight.

225
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,136
It's no Armageddon.

226
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,572
Everybody knows when the
world comes to an end,

227
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,341
the great serpent
Jörmungandr rises up,

228
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:57,911
and I, myself, will be
eaten by a big wolf.

229
00:13:57,979 --> 00:13:58,812
[laughs]

230
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,550
Oh, yeah... and why is that?

231
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:06,720
Because your beliefs are so
much more realistic?

232
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:09,489
The whole world's
getting carried around

233
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,892
on the back of a giant turtle.

234
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,126
[scoffs] Give me a break.

235
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:16,663
What are you gonna do about it?

236
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,167
You watch your mouth
when you talk to me, boy!

237
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:23,437
No one's ever proved that.

238
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,507
Stay.

239
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:39,019
We have to fight.

240
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:43,857
The archangels, the only thing
they understand is violence.

241
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:48,362
This ends in blood.
There is no other way.

242
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:53,100
It's them... or us.

243
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:57,771
With all due respect... Ma'am...

244
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,940
we haven't even tried
talking to them.

245
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:04,177
[choking]

246
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:15,289
Kali.

247
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,224
[gasps]

248
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,458
Who asked you?

249
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:24,164
Can't we all just get along?

250
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:25,299
Gabe...

251
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,334
[clicks tongue]

252
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:29,903
Sam. Dean.

253
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,273
It's always wrong
place, worst time

254
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:34,574
with you mutton-heads, huh?

255
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,509
Loki.

256
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,478
Baldur.

257
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,815
Good seeing you, too.

258
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:44,651
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.

259
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,852
Why are you here?

260
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,387
To talk about the
elephant in the room.

261
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,989
Not you.

262
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:52,059
The Apocalypse.

263
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:54,861
We can't stop it, gang.

264
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,534
But first things first.

265
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,704
The adults need to have
a little conversation.

266
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,172
Check you later.

267
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:06,206
[snaps fingers]

268
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:10,777
Okay...

269
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,946
did that...

270
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,014
Holy crap.

271
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:15,449
Yeah, tell me about it.

272
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,784
By the way, next time I say
"let's keep driving,"

273
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,853
uh... let's keep driving.

274
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:21,421
Okay, yeah, next time.

275
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,790
Uh, all right, so,
what's our next move?

276
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,158
I-I...
[chuckles]

277
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:26,760
I don't know.

278
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:29,262
We grab those poor saps
out of the freezer, I guess...

279
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,597
bust them out.

280
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,299
Gank a few freaks along
the way if we're lucky.

281
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,901
And when are you ever lucky?

282
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,471
Oh, you know what...?
Bite me, Gabriel.

283
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,472
Maybe later, big boy.

284
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,840
I should have known.

285
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,075
I mean, this had your stink
all over it from the jump.

286
00:16:42,143 --> 00:16:44,811
You think I'm behind this?

287
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,012
Please.

288
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,948
I'm the Costner
to your Houston.

289
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:49,716
I'm here to save your ass.

290
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:51,284
You want to pull us
out of the fire?

291
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:52,853
Bingo.

292
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,722
Those gods are either gonna
dust you or use you as bait.

293
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,424
Either way, you're uber-boned.

294
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,092
Wow... 'cause
a couple of months ago,

295
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,395
you were telling us that
we need to play our roles.

296
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:03,597
You were uber-boning us.

297
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:06,633
Ohhhhh, the end is still nigh.

298
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:10,337
Michael and Lucifer
are gonna dance the lambada.

299
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,606
But not tonight...
not here.

300
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:15,642
And why do you care?

301
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,445
I don't care.

302
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,715
But...

303
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,984
me and Kali, we, uh...

304
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,585
had a thing.

305
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,187
Chick was all hands.

306
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,191
What can I say...
I'm sentimental.

307
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,293
Do they have a chance...

308
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:34,428
against Satan?

309
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:35,762
Really, Sam?

310
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,465
You got a better idea, Dean?

311
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,100
It's a bad idea.

312
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:43,437
Lucifer's gonna turn them
into finger paint.

313
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:45,338
So let's get going
while the going's good.

314
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:47,541
Okay, great. Why don't you
just zap us out of here, then?

315
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,809
Would if I could...

316
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,845
but Kali's got you
by the short and curlies.

317
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:54,247
It's a blood spell.

318
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:55,916
You boys are on a leash.

319
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:57,384
What does that mean?

320
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:01,054
Means it's time for a little
of the old black magic.

321
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,255
[spray hisses] Ahh.

322
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,356
Okay. Yeah, Well, whatever.

323
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:04,424
We're gonna take
the hors d'oeuvres

324
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:05,525
in the freezer with us.

325
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:07,060
Forget it.

326
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,095
It's gonna be hard enough
sneaking you mooks out of here.

327
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,063
They called you "Loki," right?

328
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,366
Which mean they don't
really know who you are.

329
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:14,935
Told you...
I'm in Witness Protection.

330
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,704
Okay, well, then how about
you do what we say,

331
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:20,740
or we tell the,
uh, legion of doom

332
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,642
about your secret identity?

333
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,478
They don't seem like
a real pro-angel kind of crowd.

334
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,079
I'll take your voices away.

335
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,581
- We'll write it down.
- I'll cut off your hands.

336
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,915
Then people are gonna be asking,

337
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,152
"why are you guys running around
with no hands?"

338
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:35,155
[inhales deeply]

339
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:36,823
Fine.

340
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:51,171
Bonjour, mon amour.

341
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:53,673
Leave.

342
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,108
You always did
play hard to get.

343
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,710
Kali: I've moved on.

344
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:57,944
I noticed.

345
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,746
Baldur...

346
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:01,147
really?

347
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,887
Baldur's uncomplicated.

348
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,455
Man: No!

349
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,724
No, no!

350
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,926
[screaming]

351
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,530
No! No! Stop!

352
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,199
No!

353
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:22,068
It's too late.

354
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,537
[screaming]

355
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:24,804
[screaming stops]

356
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,940
Kali: I never took you
for the type.

357
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,642
Romantic?

358
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,443
Pathetic.

359
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,647
You're the one
who called me here.

360
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:38,251
Because I thought you
might take this seriously.

361
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,853
I'm taking this seriously.

362
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:43,023
Ship's sinking...
time to get off.

363
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,426
I mean, screw this marble.
Let's go check out Pandora.

364
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,828
It doesn't have to be like that.

365
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,567
Afraid it does.

366
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:55,902
If we fight...

367
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,103
You die.

368
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:58,872
And what makes you
such an expert?

369
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,541
I've tussled with those winged
ass-monkeys once or twice.

370
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:05,078
Kali... no more tricks.

371
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:07,747
I'm begging you...
don't do this.

372
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,482
I have to.

373
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:15,455
[chuckles softly]

374
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,023
Can't blame me for trying.

375
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:17,991
[chuckles softly]

376
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:20,694
Still love me?

377
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,963
No.

378
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,963
[screaming]

379
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,211
[groans]

380
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:44,784
Ow!

381
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:49,723
[grunting]

382
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,758
[gasping]

383
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:53,193
Where the hell is Gabriel?

384
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,296
You must take me for a fool...

385
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:57,697
Gabriel.

386
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:01,968
You're bound to me...
now and forever.

387
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,476
- Ghostfacers!
- Ghostfacers!

388
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:10,977
Ghostfacers

389
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:14,014
We face the ghosts
when the others will not

390
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:17,484
we're the ghost...
Ghostfacers.

391
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,519
They leave the kitchen
when the kitchen gets hot

392
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,324
Is the intern position open?

393
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:26,259
- You're hired!
- [gasps] Oh! Really?

394
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,628
- See my face... right in your little box?
- Yeah.

395
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:30,830
Okay, my face has got to be
right in your box.

396
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,365
Ghostfacers

397
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:35,568
We face the faces,
we face the ghosts

398
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:38,405
Ghostfacers.

399
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,742
If you're dead,
you better stay dead.

400
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,943
Yep.

401
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,578
'Cause if not,
we're gonna kill you.

402
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:49,504
[both grunting]

403
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,072
How long have you known?

404
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,607
Long enough.

405
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:54,675
[grunts, sighs]

406
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,878
How's the rescue going?

407
00:21:56,945 --> 00:22:00,715
Well, surprise, surprise.

408
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:02,750
The trickster's tricked us.

409
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:04,652
Kali... don't.

410
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,887
You're mine now...

411
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:13,227
and you have
something I want...

412
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:25,973
an archangel's blade.

413
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,412
From the archangel... Gabriel.

414
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:37,885
Okay!

415
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:39,253
Okay!

416
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,721
So I got wings.

417
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,223
Like kotex.

418
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,926
But that doesn't make me
any less right about Lucifer.

419
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:46,327
He's lying.

420
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:47,495
He's a spy.

421
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:49,997
I'm not a spy... I'm a runaway.

422
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:52,433
I'm trying to save you.

423
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:56,370
I know my brother, Kali...

424
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:59,407
he should scare the
living crap out of you.

425
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:01,542
You can't beat him.

426
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,946
I've skipped ahead...
seen how this story ends.

427
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:08,449
Your story... not ours.

428
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:12,753
Westerners... I swear,
the sheer arrogance.

429
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:15,756
You think you're the
only ones on earth?

430
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:19,293
You pillage and you butcher
in your God's name.

431
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,662
But you're not
the only religion.

432
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,432
And he's not the only God.

433
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:28,536
And now you think you can
just rip the planet apart?

434
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:30,438
You're wrong.

435
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:33,507
[voice breaking]
There are billions of us,

436
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:36,344
and we were here first.

437
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:39,246
If anyone gets to end this world...

438
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:43,618
it's me.

439
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:49,056
I'm sorry.

440
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,881
This is crazy.

441
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:15,082
They can die.

442
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,922
We can kill Lucifer.

443
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,524
[sighs]

444
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:26,027
All right, you
primitive screw-heads...

445
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:27,128
listen up.

446
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:28,629
Are you out of your mind?

447
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,630
I'm out of options.

448
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,867
Now, on any other given day,

449
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:36,103
I'd be doing my damnedest
to, uh, kill you,

450
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:38,039
you filthy, murdering chimps.

451
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:39,774
[chuckles]

452
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:41,575
But, uh, hey...

453
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:43,444
desperate times.

454
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:47,782
So even though
I'd love nothing better

455
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:50,451
than to slit your
throats, you... dicks...

456
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:56,057
I'm gonna help you.

457
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:57,792
I'm gonna help you
ice the devil.

458
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,226
[liquid pours]

459
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,131
And then we can all get back to
ganking each other, like normal.

460
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,435
You want Lucifer?

461
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:09,837
Well, dude's not
in the yellow pages.

462
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:12,139
But me and Sam,
we can get him here.

463
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:13,741
How?

464
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,744
First, you let
those main courses go.

465
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:18,612
Then we talk.

466
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,716
We can either take
on the devil together...

467
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:23,517
or you lame-ass
bitches can eat me.

468
00:25:27,355 --> 00:25:29,090
Literally.

469
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:30,591
Dean: Come on, everybody! Let's go!

470
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,693
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

471
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:34,428
All right. All right.

472
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:37,698
Go! Go! Go!
Get out of here!

473
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:40,801
Psst! Dean!

474
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:41,769
D... don't look at me!

475
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:44,739
Act natural.

476
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,440
Get in.

477
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:54,482
Man, there is nothing natural
about this at all.

478
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:55,750
I thought you were dead.

479
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:57,351
You think I'd give Kali
my real sword?

480
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,385
That thing can kill me.

481
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:01,055
Then what do they have in there?

482
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:02,590
A fake.

483
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:04,759
Made it out of a can
of diet orange slice.

484
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:09,363
So, uh...

485
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:10,865
go snag our blood, would ya?

486
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:12,333
What?

487
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,001
I heard you in there.

488
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:16,504
Kali likes you.
You can get close.

489
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:18,606
Lift the plasma,
then we vamoose.

490
00:26:18,673 --> 00:26:20,808
No.

491
00:26:20,876 --> 00:26:22,476
Hand over the real blade.

492
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:24,311
Better yet, why
don't you sack up

493
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:26,614
and help us take down Lucifer?

494
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:27,715
You can't be serious.

495
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:29,150
Deadly.

496
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,418
Since when are you butt-buddies
with a bunch of monsters?

497
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:33,521
That's all they are
to you, aren't they?

498
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:35,489
All right, you know what?
Sam was right. It's nuts.

499
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,924
But it's the best
idea I've heard.

500
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:38,159
So unless you have
a better one...

501
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,263
Well, good luck with that.

502
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,831
Me, I'm blowing Jonestown.

503
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,966
Those lemmings
want to run off a cliff,

504
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:47,134
that's their business.

505
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,702
I see right through you.
You know that?

506
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,038
The smart-ass shell, the whole
"I could give a crap" thing.

507
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:52,907
Believe me, it
takes one to know one.

508
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:54,375
- That so?
- Yes.

509
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:55,876
And maybe those freaks in there
aren't your blood,

510
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:57,044
but they are your family.

511
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:58,813
They just stabbed me
in the friggin' heart!

512
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,715
Maybe, but you still give a crap
about them, don't you?

513
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:02,983
Dean...

514
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:05,085
Now, they're gonna die
in there without you.

515
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:09,490
I can't kill my brother.

516
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:13,761
"Can't" or "won't"?

517
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:18,532
That's what I thought.

518
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:26,841
So, you're going to
summon Lucifer?

519
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:28,242
Sort of.

520
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,045
I just need you to squeegee
some stuff from my ribs,

521
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:32,580
and he'll come running.

522
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,714
Breaking them would be easier.

523
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,119
Show's over.

524
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:41,922
Sword's a fake.

525
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,592
And Gabriel... he's still kicking.

526
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:47,862
I hate to break it to you,
sister, but you've been tricked.

527
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:51,465
[bell dings]

528
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:56,136
Checking in.

529
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,359
Lucifer.

530
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:04,927
Thanks for coming.

531
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:06,228
Oh, you did right calling me.

532
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:09,365
It's just...

533
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:12,835
the way the talk
is heading in there, it's...

534
00:28:12,903 --> 00:28:14,236
it's insane.

535
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:20,009
You know, I never
understood you pagans.

536
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:22,645
You're such...
petty little things.

537
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:25,047
Always fighting...

538
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:27,116
always happy to sell
out your own kind.

539
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,655
No wonder you forfeited
this planet to us.

540
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:36,125
You are worse than humans.

541
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:38,827
You're worse than demons.

542
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:41,330
And yet you claim to be gods.

543
00:28:47,237 --> 00:28:48,137
[bones crunch]

544
00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:55,244
And they call me prideful.

00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:01,383
What's happening?

[Odin screaming]

00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:06,322
[bones crunch]

549
00:29:31,314 --> 00:29:33,215
It's him.

550
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:34,416
How?

551
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:35,551
Does it matter?

552
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:37,653
Shazam us out of
here, would you?

553
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:39,054
We can't.

554
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:43,692
Of course you can't.

555
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:47,296
You didn't say
"mother, may I?"

556
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:50,299
Sam, Dean. Good
to see you again.

557
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,868
Baldur... don't.

558
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:54,236
You think you own the planet?

559
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:58,073
What gives you the right?!

560
00:29:58,141 --> 00:29:59,508
[gasps]

561
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:01,477
No one gives us the right.

562
00:30:03,113 --> 00:30:04,213
We take it.

563
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,841
Are you okay?

564
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:34,076
Not really.

565
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:36,512
Better late than never, huh?

566
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:40,416
Guard this with your life.

00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,416
[Grunts and moans]

568
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:56,365
Lucy...

569
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm home.

570
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:02,204
Not this time.

571
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:11,013
Guys...!

572
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:13,649
Get her out of here.

573
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:18,387
Over a girl.

574
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:20,122
Gabriel, really?

575
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,891
I mean, I knew
you were slumming, but...

576
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,693
I hope you didn't
catch anything.

577
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,230
Lucifer...

578
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:30,432
you're my brother,
and I love you.

579
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,636
But you are a great big bag of dicks.

580
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:36,638
What did you just say to me?

581
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:38,173
Look at yourself.

582
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,042
Boo-hoo.

583
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,478
"Daddy was mean to me, so I'm
gonna smash up all his toys."

584
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:43,712
Watch your tone.

585
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,247
Play the victim all you want.

586
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:48,684
But you and me...
we know the truth.

587
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,488
Dad loved you best.

588
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,857
More than Michael.

589
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:56,859
More than me.

590
00:31:56,926 --> 00:31:59,128
Then he brought
the new baby home,

591
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,996
and you couldn't handle it.

592
00:32:01,064 --> 00:32:05,200
So all this is just
a great big temper tantrum.

593
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:10,105
Time to grow up.

594
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:13,509
I'm not getting in that thing.

595
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:14,543
Just get in the car, princess.

[engine turns over,

597
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:23,185
Gabriel, if you're
doing this for Michael...

598
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:24,586
Screw him.

599
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,688

I'd shiv his ass, too.

Who...

605
00:32:34,364 --> 00:32:37,433
these... so-called gods?

606
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,867
- To people, Lucifer.
- Hmm.

607
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,637
People.

608
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:44,740
So you're willing to die
for a pile of cockroaches?

609
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:45,741
Why?

610
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,543
Because dad was right.

00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:50,179
They are better than us.

612
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:53,015
They are broken,
flawed abortions.

613
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:54,616
Damn right they're flawed.

try... to do better,

616
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:01,457
to forgive.

617
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,327

I've been riding
the pine a long time,

but I'm in the game now.

620
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:16,271
And I'm not on your
side or Michael's.

621
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:20,075
I'm on theirs.

622
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:25,914
Brother, don't make me do this.

623

I know you think you're doing
the right thing, Gabriel...

625

your heart truly lies.

guard this with your life?

Maybe he's a fan.

644

It is a good one.

you ordered.

what the hell's going on.

Well...

656
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:35,627
if you're watching this...

657
00:35:35,695 --> 00:35:36,761
I'm dead.

zero shot at killing Lucifer.

The cage you sprung Lucifer
from is still down there.

666

And maybe... just maybe...
you can shove his ass back in.

667

Not that it'll be easy.

668
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:05,056
You got to get the cage open,
trick my bro back into it...

669

and, uh... oh, yeah...

670

avoid Michael
and the God squad.

671

Lucifer himself
doesn't even know.

674
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:21,940
But the key to the cage...
it's out there.

675
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:25,377
Actually, it's keys... plural.

676
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:26,845
Four keys.

677
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:28,947
Well, four rings...

678
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:30,749
from the horsemen.

679
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:33,551
You get them all,
you got the cage.

680
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,720
Can't say I'm
betting on you boys.

681
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:38,323
But, uh, hey,
I've been wrong before.

682
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:41,393
And, Dean...

683
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,994
you were right.

684
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:44,796
I was afraid to
stand up to my brother.

[growls playfully]

686
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:48,900
Not anymore.

687
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:52,037
So this is me standing up.

688
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:54,005
And this is me...

Oh! Oh, man.

696
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:10,655
Well, we got War's,

697
00:37:14,393 --> 00:37:15,493
we nicked Famine's.

698
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:20,332
That's two rings down.
Collect all four.

699
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,866
All we need is,
Pestilence and Death.

700

Oh, is that all?

701
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,603

I got a lot of driving to do.

716

Blue ones make you sleepy.
