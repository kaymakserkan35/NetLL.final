1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,764
<i>Come in close.</i>

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,366
<i>Closer.</i>

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,244
<i>Because the more you think you see,</i>

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,766
<i>the easier it'll be to fool you.</i>

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,289
<i>Because what is seeing?</i>

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,405
<i>You're looking, but what you're really doing
is filtering, interpreting,</i>

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,448
<i>searching for meaning.</i>

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,680
<i>My job?</i>

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,765
<i>To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,</i>

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,722
<i>and use it against you.</i>

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,087
I'm going to flip through this deck.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,650
And I want you to see one card.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,171
Not this one. That's too obvious.

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,891
Pay close attention.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,771
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,046
Are you ready?

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,121
Okay.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,969
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,043
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,969
Now, do you see your card here?

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,567
No.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,847
That's because you're looking too closely.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,968
And what have I been telling you all night?

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,530
The closer you look...

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,170
The less you see.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,806
Now look into my eyes.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
And sleep. Okay.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,566
And...

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,326
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,363
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,086
If you can say your name, you can have it.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,641
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,121
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,725
-of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,966
I'm picturing...

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,042
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,242
Beach. Cocktails.

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,881
Florida?

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,450
Look, it was a business trip.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,642
I mean, it is a kind of business.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,610
Maybe the oldest business.

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,926
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,565
She can't move, Mack.

44
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,051
You're thinking of a woman's name.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,605
A! B! C!

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,920
DI El Fl GI

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,126
H, I, J...

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,049
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,361
Who's Janet?

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,200
You know Janet?

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,560
It's not your best friend, is it?

52
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,570
- Your sister?
- No, please.

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,881
Her sister? Oh, my God.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,048
You weren't away on business.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,849
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,246
Your wife's sister!

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,929
Okay, we need to move over here,

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,526
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

59
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,841
You want this to go away?

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,570
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,610
Come on, get it out.

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,966
Do you shake down everybody like this?

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,844
No, only the special few.

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,002
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,162
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,241
You're a stick-up artist.

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,004
Yeah. Of course.

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,570
Okay, and sleep!

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,005
Now, when I snap my fingers,

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,570
you won't remember any of this.

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,846
<i>And you, Warren Beam],</i>

72
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,924
every time you see or even think of Janet,

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,726
you're gonna picture me naked.

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,926
And that's not a pretty sight.

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,041
Yeah.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,282
And... You're wide awake!

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,886
Well, we did the best we could,

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,122
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,487
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,284
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,646
Look after her.

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,449
Just have to hit an ATM first.

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,207
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

84
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,442
and I will give $100

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,841
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

86
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,562
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

87
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,085
Check it out.

88
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,846
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,408
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

90
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,007
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,605
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

92
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,923
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,126
I've got other tricks.

94
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,441
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,601
You said you would.

96
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,920
Nice wallet.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,240
You have a very good eye, sir.

98
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,321
Thanks.

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,811
Wallet.

100
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,202
My wallet. My watch!

101
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,961
Stop that guy!

102
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,166
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,241
He's got my wallet!

104
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,045
Okay, Los Angeles,

105
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,804
are we ready to end this thing?

106
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,881
Yeah!

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,008
When that timer hits zero,

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,801
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,803
will fall from above.

110
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,611
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

111
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,565
One, two, three!

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,201
Yeah!

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,244
Help! Stop it!

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,924
She's serious! She can't get out!

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,530
Go get some help!

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,401
Help, dude!

117
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,241
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

118
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,288
Come On! This is bullshit!

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,609
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

120
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,286
Yes!

121
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,650
I am your biggest fan.

122
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,683
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

123
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,000
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,684
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

125
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,330
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,890
How did you do that...

127
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,291
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,930
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,407
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

130
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,561
How much?

131
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,641
50 bucks.

132
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,809
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

133
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,001
Is it always a seven?

134
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,684
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

135
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,649
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

136
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,161
I'll see what I can do.

137
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,124
Magic man!

138
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,891
I love your shampoo.

139
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,440
- Hold up.
- What?

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,887
You need to leave.

141
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,961
Are you kidding me?

142
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,162
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

143
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,401
Is this what you do?

144
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,448
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

145
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,768
"45 East Evan Street."

146
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,331
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

147
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,931
You don't have my number.

148
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,168
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

149
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,765
You are such an asshole.

150
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,367
Hey!

151
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,527
Henley.

152
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,928
<i>Danny'? He'!-</i>

153
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,800
You got a card, huh?

154
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,001
No,no,no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

155
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,081
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,486
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

157
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,766
You wait out here. I will come back

158
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,921
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,764
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

160
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,371
Nice hair.

161
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,169
So, actually, what have you been up to?

162
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,368
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

163
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,205
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

164
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,520
You have a website. That's good.

165
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,364
Good for you. Get the word out.

166
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,325
Okay.

167
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,563
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

168
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,286
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,521
Yeah. Excuse me.

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,409
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

171
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,086
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

172
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,770
Helen? No, no.

173
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,285
Henley.

174
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,600
It's on your coffee cup.

175
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,484
Thanks for keeping me honest.

176
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,085
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,281
It was just an observation.

178
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,967
Second observation, you are beautiful.

179
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,162
Thank you.

180
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,960
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

181
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,327
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,210
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

183
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,287
I'm not interested in you doing

184
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,521
your mentalism thing on us.

185
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,286
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

186
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,125
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

187
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm sorry, have we met before?

188
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,965
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

189
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,121
You are a control freak.

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,282
Well, I take that as a compliment.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,771
Only he would take it as a compliment.

192
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,842
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

193
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,288
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

194
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,486
A couple? No, no.

195
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,766
We were never a couple.

196
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,649
He used to saw me in half.

197
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,767
She was a very good assistant.

198
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,887
But I was too fat for Danny.

199
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,804
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

200
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,882
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

201
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,485
No one could fit through there. No one.

202
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,721
Rebecca fit through.

203
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,484
Rebecca fit for years.

204
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,244
Do you know how hard it is to stay

205
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,203
in those tiny little costumes?

206
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,243
No. I'm the main attraction.

207
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,488
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

208
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,485
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

209
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,005
That's a really nice story.

210
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,764
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,161
No way.

212
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,924
J. Daniel Atlas?

213
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,646
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

214
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,006
You're like...

215
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,320
I idolize you. Seriously.

216
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,925
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,525
I'm Jack, by the way.

218
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,011
Question. Did you get one of these?

219
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,927
Yeah. Death.

220
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,961
The High Priestess.

221
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,326
I'm the Lover.

222
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,527
Three minutes.

223
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,601
Hermit.

224
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,451
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

225
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,085
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

226
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,686
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

227
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,169
What is this place?

228
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,130
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

229
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,962
Man, it's freezing in here.

230
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,687
What's that?

231
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,086
I don't know.

232
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,361
What's it say?

233
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,170
"Now you don't."

234
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,282
"A rose by any other name..."

235
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,407
Guys, what's happening?

236
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,605
Look at that.

237
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,446
It's gag!

238
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,762
Relax. Just dry ice.

239
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,561
Cool.

240
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,010
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

241
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,844
Hang on. Hang on.

242
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,841
I got nothin'.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,764
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

244
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,962
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

245
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,610
Okay, so you're like Buddha,

246
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,125
if he wasn't so enlightened.

247
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,565
And you're like Jesus,

248
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,211
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

249
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,566
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

250
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,483
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

251
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,686
No. Wait, did you?

252
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,126
I Wish.

253
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,887
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

254
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,041
Oh, great.

255
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,164
Electricity is out.

256
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,809
Well, let's check.

257
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,130
Blueprints.

258
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,331
They're incredible.

259
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,125
Who do you think did this?

260
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,442
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

261
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,970
It's a show.

262
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,245

263
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,325

268
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,085
Thank you.

269
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,322
Tonight we would like to try something

270
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,966
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

271
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,565
For our final trick,

272
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,608
we're gonna do something never before

273
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,682
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

274
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,041
Or any stage for that matter.

275
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,683
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,721
tonight

277
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,768
we are going to rob a bank.

278
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,488
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

279
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,886
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

280
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,601
One, two, three!

281
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,203
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

282
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,560
during the performance.

283
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,642
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

284
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,801
Let me just put this away.

285
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,211
Actually, I need to take that.

286
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,726
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

287
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,805
Okay.

288
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,649
Okay, Okay-

289
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,723
Now, please, please, settle down.

290
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,324
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

291
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,562
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

292
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,444
So we'll choose one at random then.

293
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,731
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

294
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,961
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,731
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

296
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,802
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,490
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

298
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,721
Where is Section B?

299
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,880
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

300
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,731
I don't know why everybody's happy.

301
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,847
It's only them.

302
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,724
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

303
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,681
Thank you, Merritt.

304
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,569
We are looking at row number 5.

305
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,766
Where is that?

306
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,684
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

307
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,130
Oh. Lucky number 13.

308
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,885
B-5-13. Where are you?

309
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,841
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

310
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,090
Could you just confirm for me that this

311
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,208
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

312
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,281
Yes.

313
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,362
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

314
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,805
your name and the name of your bank?

315
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,207
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

316
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,802
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

317
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,161
French. Okay.

318
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,925
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

319
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,287
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

320
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,408
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

321
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,720
Could you please come up to the stage

322
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,040
and we'll rob your bank.

323
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,288
And while he does that...

324
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,646
There is someone here tonight

325
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,484
without whom we would just be

326
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,562
four magicians working the circuit,

327
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,641
trying to get--...

328
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,251
Well, actually, trying to get here.

329
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,606
You probably know this man,

330
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,205
if not from one of the many, many

331
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,560
companies he puts his name on.

332
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,768
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

333
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,171
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

334
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,322
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

335
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,401
The only man here with

336
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,642
the Queen's cell phone number.

337
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,162
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

338
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,447
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

339
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,887
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,081
the biggest name in magic.

341
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,605
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

342
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,682
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

343
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,842
we made sure we put your name on top.

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,082
If you turn out to be as good

345
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,009
as you think you are, dear girl,

346
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,282
that won't be necessary much longer.

347
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,760
We haven't done our closer yet.

348
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,046
Why don't you watch it

349
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,451
and then you can decide for yourself.

350
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

351
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,445
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

352
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,568
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

353
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,043
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

354
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,881
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

355
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,122
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

356
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,126
to literally fold through space and time

357
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,567
to your bank in the...

358
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,767
8th?

359
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,883
-9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

360
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,883
Now, once you are there,

361
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,042
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

362
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,884
NOW if...

363
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,844
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

364
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,161
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

365
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,001
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

366
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,726
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

367
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,404
- Thank you. Thank you...
-it is.

368
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,086
Thank you. Thank you very much.

369
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,805
But before you go anywhere,

370
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,922
could you please, pick a card, any card.

371
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,246
Not that card.

372
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,762
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

373
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,405
Okay. This one?

374
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,602
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

375
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,288
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

376
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,841
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

377
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,685
- That's good.
- Thanks.

378
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,926
Put it in your pocket.

379
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,681
And now for one tiny detail.

380
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,682
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

381
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,121
<i>And</i> I'll <i>step off of it. Bonne chance.</i>

382
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,965
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

383
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,288
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

384
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,847
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

385
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,041
One,

386
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,201
two...

387
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,361
Three.

388
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,801
What the fuck?

389
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,650
- Efienne?
- Efienne?

390
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,768
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

391
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,126
Efienne?

392
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,482
I liked that little French guy.

393
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,727
Where did he go?

394
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,250
Wait, there he is.

395
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,568
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

396
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,491
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

397
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,840
Etienne? Are you okay?

398
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,001
<i>Yes.</i>

399
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,481
Perfect. What do you see in there?

400
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,521
Money.

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,126
Is this real?

402
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,726
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

403
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,524
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

404
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,568
<i>I want you to take the card that you signed</i>

405
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,880
<i>out of your pocket.</i>

406
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,441
And I want you to take the ticket stub

407
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,567
from tonight's show

408
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,807
<i>and I want you to put it right there</i>

409
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,962
<i>in the middle of the money.</i>

410
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,201
Now drop it.

411
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,483
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

412
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,891
Don't press it just yet.

413
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,724
<i>That button activates an air duct</i>

414
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,565
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

415
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,051
<i>Okay, good. Now you can press it.</i>

416
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,402
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

417
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,845
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

418
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,285
Wait a second.

419
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,287
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

420
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,521
We are The Four Horsemen.

421
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,726
And good night!

422
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,404
Good night!

423
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,966
Hold up here.

424
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,924
Dylan Rhodes.

425
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,562
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

426
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,085
Did you say magicians?

427
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,083
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

428
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,366
<i>Where are you now?</i>

429
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,482
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

430
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,603
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

431
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,045
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

432
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,169
Let's go. Get 'em up.

433
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,646
Put the book down.

434
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,604
Okay. You got me.

435
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,205
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

436
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,445
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

437
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,047
Let's go.

438
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,848
<i>Boss, please tell me this is a joke.</i>

439
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,969
<i>I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.</i>

440
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,769
I'm a month, two tops,

441
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,330
away from blowing this whole thing open.

442
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,447
Get Turkelson.

443
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,646
He's in Atlantic City.

444
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,960
What about Cowan? Look at him.

445
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,485
He's just sitting there on his ass.

446
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,766
Hilarious, Rhodes.

447
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,366
I love you.

448
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,727
Asshole.

449
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,490
I don't have time for this magic crap.

450
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,131
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

451
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,361
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

452
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,965
Actually, 3.2.

453
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,601
Who is she?

454
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,601
Who are you?

455
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,370
Alma Dray from Interpol.

456
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,010
I'll be working the investigation with you.

457
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,286
You gotta be kidding me.

458
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,930
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

459
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,166
David Copperfield and Friends.

460
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,483
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

461
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,801
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

462
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,850
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

463
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,491
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

464
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,086
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

465
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,329
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

466
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,925
Besides, he's useless.

467
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,804
Oh, really? Why is that?

468
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,167
Because he believes their magic was real.

469
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,924
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

470
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,445
You're right, he probably is useless.

471
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,888
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

472
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,530
Thank you.

473
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,323
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

474
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,801
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

475
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,326
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

476
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,971
- I did.
- Fine. Fantastic. You did.

477
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,611
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

478
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,081
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

479
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,324
With the teleportation helmet.

480
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,444
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

481
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,409
He was hypnotized during the show.

482
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,323
I told you, he's useless.

483
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,526
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done

484
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,170
with this other bullshit.

485
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,687
Hey!

486
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,444
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

487
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,806
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

488
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,207
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

489
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,762
Okay. Hey, hey. Ecoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

490
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,126
You're not in the Philharmonic.

491
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,601
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

492
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,767
Tell him to stop.

493
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,084
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

494
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,243
Okay, I need a time-out.

495
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,845
Too many French people in one room.

496
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,485
Agent Rhodes!

497
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,245
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

498
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,409
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

499
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,050
So we can work together,

500
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,129
or you can continue to follow behind

501
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,368
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

502
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,641
It's up to you.

503
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,891
I'm not finished.

504
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,766
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

505
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,201
And I do not handle jet lag well.

506
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,721
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

507
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,922
I promise you, you will lose.

508
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,648
Fine. So which one of these idiots

509
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,131
do you want to talk to first?

510
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,247
Him?

511
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,926
Dylan, for the record,

512
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,128
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

513
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,281
Okay.

514
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,691
That is to say, that it's not a science.

515
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,080
It's more for entertainment.

516
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,440
All right.

517
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,888
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

518
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,684
Please convey my deepest apologies

519
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,564
to your colleague out there.

520
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,041
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

521
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,281
I was out of line.

522
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,600
Tranny Tuesday?

523
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,364
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

524
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,209
Or might not have, if you believe

525
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,766
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

526
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,446
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

527
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,409
of men wearing dresses?

528
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,841
<i>No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.</i>

529
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,524
I'm just having fun.

530
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,921
Was this your card? No.

531
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,331
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

532
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,401
and I respect that.

533
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,369
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

534
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,487
but I understand protocol.

535
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,891
Okay, Okay-

536
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,566
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

537
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,246
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

538
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,321
Oh, yes. That would be...

539
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,925
What do the kids call it these days?

540
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,166
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

541
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,242
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

542
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,926
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

543
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,888
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

544
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,084
It says here you are a mentalist.

545
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,326
What exactly is mentalism?

546
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,370
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

547
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,446
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

548
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,843
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

549
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,204
Voices in my head.

550
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,444
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

551
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,522
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

552
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,126
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

553
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,202
-two TV specials.
- Glory days.

554
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,882
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

555
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,291
Did your research, did you?

556
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,203
IRS audit. Back taxes.

557
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,044
You've had a long hard slog back

558
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,521
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

559
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,288
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

560
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,448
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

561
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,721
put on the magical helmet...

562
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,801
Listen to me.

563
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,491
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

564
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,686
Which makes you an accomplice.

565
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,161
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

566
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,327
Now you listen to me, unless you think

567
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,811
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

568
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,370
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

569
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,601
then we have a show to perform.

570
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,847
And you, Agent Rhodes,

571
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,285
have a drawing board to get back to.

572
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,805
Is this your first date?

573
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,041
What?

574
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,920
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

575
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,482
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

576
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,403
And before you get involved,

577
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,007
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

578
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,804
And I know the first one is that

579
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,009
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

580
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,890
You should have said something to him.

581
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,122
This is a weird way for you to find out.

582
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,043
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

583
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,527
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

584
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,045
Because if you did, it means that you,

585
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,202
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

586
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,767
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

587
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,490
The press would have a field day.

588
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,489
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

589
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,800
And you guys would look like idiots

590
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,211
even more then you already are.

591
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,762
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

592
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,524
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

593
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,045
"nothing up your sleeve."

594
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,281
And you know it.

595
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,442
Don't draw him in and then dump him

596
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,002
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

597
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,681
Mommy?

598
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,600
Daddy.

599
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,365
You have big daddy issues.

600
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,010
- Okay, that's enough.
<i>- I'll</i> tell you what.

601
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,368
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

602
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,767
Me? I'll take a tenner.

603
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,409
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

604
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,403
I'll still take a tenner.

605
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,688
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

606
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,882
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

607
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,525
And you know who put them there?

608
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,523
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

609
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,571
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

610
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,484
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

611
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,688
And the instant that you even show

612
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,445
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

613
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,851
I'll be there.

614
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,490
I will be all over you like...

615
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,766
Like white on rice?

616
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,530
Sorry. That's unfair.

617
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,721
Let me warn you.

618
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,927
I want you to follow.

619
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,451
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

620
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,085
we will always be one step, three steps,

621
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,207
seven steps ahead of you.

622
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,520
And just when you think you're catching up,

623
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,965
that's when we'll be right behind you.

624
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,530
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

625
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,681
exactly where I want you to be.

626
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,410
So come close. Get all over me

627
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,811
because the closer you think you are,

628
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,291
the less you'll actually see.

629
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,361
I'm gonna nail you...

630
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,167
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

631
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680
Oh! Shit!

632
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,805
First rule of magic.

633
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,887
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

634
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,849
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

635
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,128
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

636
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

637
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,084
- What changed?
- I met them.

638
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,161
Hey. Guys.

639
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,960
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

640
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,166
Most of it was just filler.

641
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,924
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

642
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,809
But guess who was sitting there in the back,

643
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,041
filming the whole damn thing?

644
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,161
I don't know.

645
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,730
Thaddeus Bradley.

646
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,402
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

647
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,521
No.

648
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,921
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

649
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,843
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

650
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,001
Get him on the phone.

651
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,764
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

652
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,887
Good.

653
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,725
<i>Mr. Bradley started as a magician.</i>

654
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,529
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

655
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,968
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

656
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,210
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

657
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,681
That's a man who loves his work.

658
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,969
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

659
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,884
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

660
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,481
I will take one.

661
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,611
That's incredible. That's amazing.

662
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,361
Red dye, palmed.

663
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,131
Is that how Jesus did it? That's incredible.

664
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,565
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

665
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,927
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

666
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,245
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

667
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,890
in the last half decade?

668
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,246
About 1.6 million.

669
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,642
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

670
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,051
Five million.

671
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,167
Right, so it's about the money.

672
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,730
Well, the money is only there

673
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,088
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

674
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,449
Like you, I detest those
who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

675
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,206
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

676
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,807
Cost?

677
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,166
I don't know. Careers.

678
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,366
Lives.

679
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,683
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

680
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,963
I'm sorry, who?

681
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,565
Lionel Shrike.

682
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,009
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

683
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,846
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

684
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,402
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

685
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,925
He was shackled inside a safe,

686
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,809
and dropped into the river.

687
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,041
But he never resurfaced.

688
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,361
You mean he died?

689
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,249
I didn't kill him.

690
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,564
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

691
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,881
You do realize this is a game?

692
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,769
Believe me, it's not a game.

693
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,001
It is a game.

694
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,844
You're the game. You're being played.

695
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,367
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

696
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,204
I mean, come on.

697
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,281
You got me.

698
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,646
If you really want to know

699
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,520
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

700
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,568
my special comes out next month.

701
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,766
Or I could just bring you in

702
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,320
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

703
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,925
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

704
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,129
you actually don't know how they did it.

705
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,282
Showmanship and theatrics.

706
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,608
When a magician waves his hand and says,

707
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,324
"This is where the magic is happening."

708
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,006
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

709
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,450
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

710
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,927
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

711
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,645
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

712
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,485
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

713
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,000
But don't take my word for it.

714
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,164
How about a trip to Paris?

715
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,769
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

716
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,611
You're joking, right?

717
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,041
You wanna know how they did it or not?

718
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,445
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

719
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,485
Step right up.

720
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,444
There you go.

721
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,761
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

722
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,724
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

723
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,962
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

724
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,122
just say the magic word.

725
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,601
Blow me?

726
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,364
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

727
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,529
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

728
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,128
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

729
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,084
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

730
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,686
My fun.

731
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,286
What?

732
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,725
Nothing.

733
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,641
So they got a vault set.

734
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,801
Yes.

735
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,006
And it's the exact replica

736
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,241
of the little French guy's bank.

737
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,367
So he's a plant.

738
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,930
He was a dupe, not a plant.

739
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,162
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

740
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,841
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

741
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,405
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

742
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,562
They let them think they picked the seat.

743
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,045
We'll choose one at random then.

744
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,403
<i>Actually, they were just palming the ball</i>

745
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,204
<i>with the seat number they wanted.</i>

746
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,523
We are looking at row number 5.

747
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,011
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

748
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,521
Lucky number 13.

749
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,648
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

750
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,324
<i>He was selected.</i>

751
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,088
<i>They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.</i>

752
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,361
Viva Las Vegas.

753
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,489
<i>And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.</i>

754
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,920
<i>They trailed him.</i>

755
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,166
<i>They studied him.</i>

756
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,004
<i>Nothing was left to chance.</i>

757
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,281
I got his measurements.

758
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,727
<i>He had no idea he was their target.</i>

759
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,008
<i>And they simply activated him in Vegas.</i>

760
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,366
When I snap my fingers...

761
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,040
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

762
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,241
<i>But how did they know what bank was his?</i>

763
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,726
- You're kidding.
- Really?

764
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,446
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

765
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,561
Yes.

766
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,321
Like this.

767
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,808
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

768
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,407
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

769
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,401
You ready?

770
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,801
Yes.

771
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,131
Credit card.

772
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,324
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

773
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,368
they left in the vault in Paris.

774
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,441
Very good.

775
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,170
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

776
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,284
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

777
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,925
You said they didn't steal the money.

778
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,650
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

779
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,205
I said they didn't rob the bank.

780
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,328
<i>My guess is that they targeted</i>

781
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,084
<i>a shipment of freshly minted money</i>

782
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,085
<i>headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.</i>

783
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,285
<i>Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.</i>

784
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,046
<i>Unless you're already inside.</i>

785
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,649
<i>And despite what the banks
would have you believe,</i>

786
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,564
<i>the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.</i>

787
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,850
<i>For our Horsemen,</i>

788
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,161
<i>it was almost too easy.</i>

789
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,641
Hey, boys.

790
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,607
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

791
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,445
<i>Flash paper.</i>

792
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,887
<i>Magicians use it all the time.</i>

793
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,890
<i>Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.</i>

794
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,607
<i>Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,</i>

795
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,371
<i>but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.</i>

796
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,920
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

797
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,765
Give your audience $3 million.

798
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,325
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

799
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,646
Best finale ever.

800
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,166
<i>They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.</i>

801
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,720
<i>Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,</i>

802
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,848
put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

803
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,287
<i>I always do. It's lawyer first,</i>

804
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,408
<i>-then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.</i>

805
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,891
Yes. Then the children.

806
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,445
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

807
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,681
And what's that?

808
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,889
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

809
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,122
Unrequited and misguided,

810
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,010
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

811
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,765
Consequently, you're very tightly...

812
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,444
How should I put it?

813
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,961
Corked.

814
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,041
Oh, lam?

815
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,761
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

816
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,491
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

817
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,248
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

818
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,606
Wow. Thanks.

819
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,445
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

820
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,445
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

821
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,082
<i>We should be getting there
a few minutes early.</i>

822
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,241
<i>So, sit back, relax.</i>

823
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,084
<i>We should be in the Big Easy soon.</i>

824
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,889
<i>Appreciate you flying with us today.</i>

825
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,406
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

826
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,561
Ego.

827
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,004
Okay, pick your card.

828
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,960
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

829
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,883
No, don't tell me.

830
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,769
-Okay-
-Okay-

831
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,251
Thaddeus was there that night.

832
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,766
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

833
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,524
What are you saying?

834
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,090
You think they could be working together.

835
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,605
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

836
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,125
were a bunch of street magicians

837
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,770
a year ago with no resources.

838
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,411
So, how do they go from doing that to this

839
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,925
without some kind of outside help?

840
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,445
Is this your card?

841
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,922
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

842
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,289
Nice shuffle.

843
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,521
You know, this is hard.

844
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,647
According to this book,

845
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,770
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

846
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,929
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

847
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,241
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

848
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,561
Or specifically those guys?

849
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,926
I could care less about magicians in general.

850
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,844
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

851
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,046
Exploit them how?

852
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,485
Try again.

853
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,523
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

854
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,365
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

855
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,330
in order to make their lives more bearable.

856
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,204
I see it as a strength.

857
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,248
My life is happier when I believe that.

858
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,645
Is this your card?

859
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,926
Yeah.

860
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,841
Yeah?

861
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,485
- Yeah.
- Cool.

862
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,248
That smile on your face. Is it real?

863
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,560
Maybe.

864
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,441
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

865
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,965
Do you feel exploited?

866
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,283
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

867
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,800
Guy goes to the doctor.

868
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,927
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna

869
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,081
"have to stop masturbating."

870
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,161
He says, "Why?"

871
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,730
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

872
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,881
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

873
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,530
-my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

874
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,840
Hey, guys.

875
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,731
We got a show to prepare for.

876
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,167
Do we now?

877
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,287
No, no, no, don't do that.

878
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,521
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

879
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,926
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

880
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,604
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

881
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,091
I know all of your little tricks.

882
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,321
That what they are to you? Tricks?

883
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,129
Yes, it's gimmicks. it's Barnum statements.

884
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,929
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

885
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,650
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

886
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,484
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

887
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,767
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

888
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,330
No.

889
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,687
Do me.

890
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,171
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

891
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,241
Okay.

892
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,407
Even better.

893
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,481
- Art.
- Yeah.

894
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,364
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

895
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,487
when I want to be.

896
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,767
Just stay with me, okay?

897
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,283
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

898
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,448
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

899
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,443
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

900
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,443
A brutish breed. Like a real...

901
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,682
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

902
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,206
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

903
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,363
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

904
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,211
Sorry.

905
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,486
Wait, let me try one.

906
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,641
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

907
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,801
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

908
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,490
He can do way better than that.

909
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,561
Let's do family.

910
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,889
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

911
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,611
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

912
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,961
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

913
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,565
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

914
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,804
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

915
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,564
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

916
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,130
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

917
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,647
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

918
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,370
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

919
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,487
That was your childhood?

920
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,927
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

921
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,928
Don't worry. Just you wait.

922
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,323
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

923
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,526
<i>What, are you kidding me?</i>

924
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,170
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

925
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,163
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

926
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,607
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

927
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,448
Hey, hey! There you are.

928
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,125
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

929
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,241
while she's in New Orleans?

930
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,561
No. In fact, here, speaking French

931
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,324
is actually an asset.

932
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,925
Do you see that woman up there?

933
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,086
That's Marie Claire.

934
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,447
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

935
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,091
You're welcome.

936
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,726
Yeah.

937
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,450
We got a place.

938
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,609
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

939
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,091
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

940
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,243
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

941
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,166
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

942
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,131
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

943
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,803
This other guy, Maximillian...

944
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,970
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

945
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,880
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

946
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,883
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

947
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,167
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

948
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,050
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

949
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,327
This what? This magic?

950
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,091
Lionel Shrike.

951
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,847
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

952
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,924
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

953
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,531
They saw the tree in half.

954
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,682
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

955
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,603
is the card with the signature.

956
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,806
HOW did he do that?

957
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,242
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

958
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,925
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

959
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,570
<i>No, but I do have some good news.</i>

960
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,768
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

961
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,604
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

962
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,966
What tracking bracelets?

963
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,280
<i>He has every member of his crew</i>

964
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,964
<i>wearing a tracking bracelet.</i>

965
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,122
<i>Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.</i>

966
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,406
<i>So as long as Atlas is tracking them...</i>

967
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,561
Next.

968
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,721
...our boys can track Atlas

969
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,211
from right here in the mobile command unit.

970
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,288
<i>Okay, call me if you get any movement.</i>

971
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,691
Copy that.

972
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,847
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

973
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,841
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

974
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,846
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

975
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,890
And I watch the people make a wish

976
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,082
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

977
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,845
Then throw the key into the Seine.

978
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,242
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

979
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,488
Watching the key sink into the water

980
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,803
and their secret is locked away forever.

981
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,004
Real and, at the same time, magical.

982
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,366
So,

983
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,886
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

984
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,600
Yeah.

985
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,963
<i>There is a legend of a secret order</i>

986
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,929
<i>born in ancient Egypt called</i>

987
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,691
<i>"The Eye."</i>

988
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,840
<i>It is said they perfected sleight of hand</i>

989
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,002
<i>to steal food from the Pharaohs</i>

990
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,889
<i>and give it to the slaves.</i>

991
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,486
<i>Their purpose?</i>

992
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,565
<i>Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.</i>

993
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,764
<i>Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?</i>

994
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,927
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

995
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,009
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

996
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,164
get the better of them?

997
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,090
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

998
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,242
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

999
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,641
which you don't, or you should leave.

1000
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,606
If I want something to cease or desist,

1001
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,921
it does.

1002
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,326
Take five.

1003
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,449
According to your potential backers,

1004
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,281
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

1005
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,965
from your best special.

1006
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,851
I have here a check

1007
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,840
for 3.5 million.

1008
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,121
To walk away?

1009
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,966
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

1010
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,805
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

1011
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,442
You're in this to ride them up.

1012
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,962
I'm in it to ride them down.

1013
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,284
I take it that we do not have a deal.

1014
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,124
And therein lies our conflict.

1015
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,800
Let me be blunt.

1016
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,689
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

1017
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,724
And my lawyers are much stronger.

1018
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,163
And they will manacle you

1019
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,243
with so many injunctions.

1020
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,721
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

1021
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,491
everything that you own drain away

1022
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,846
in front of your greedy little eyes.

1023
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,167
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

1024
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,050
And I'm still here.

1025
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,489
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

1026
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,769
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

1027
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,241
the ride down, which you mentioned,

1028
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:38,565
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

1029
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,202
You shouldn't have done that.

1030
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,124
According to superstition,

1031
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,324
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

1032
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,883
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

1033
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,205
Isn't that funny?

1034
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,042
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

1035
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,041
Do me a favor.

1036
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,170
Visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience.

1037
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,327
Stay out of my head, you perv.

1038
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,086
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

1039
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,202
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

1040
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,169
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

1041
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,811
I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

1042
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,486
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

1043
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,766
And on demand.

1044
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,844
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, no?

1045
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,924
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

1046
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,447
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

1047
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,000
Make any magician's wish come true.

1048
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,525
You've come a long way,

1049
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,409
much further
than anyone would have expected

1050
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,522
of a bunch of wanna-bes and has-beens.

1051
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,764
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

1052
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,242
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

1053
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,482
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

1054
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,281
By all means.

1055
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,922
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1056
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,964
He wants to be a great magician someday.

1057
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,804
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

1058
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,005
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

1059
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,641
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

1060
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,286
Tell me. Am I getting close?

1061
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,964
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

1062
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,484
Okay. Name a card.

1063
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,130
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

1064
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,440
Okay.

1065
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,723
- It's up your left sleeve.
- Is it?

1066
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,564
No. No, I don't see it up there.

1067
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,361
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

1068
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,201
Yeah.

1069
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,646
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by,
but this is kind of a talent only area, so...

1070
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,921
Break a leg.

1071
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,162
Hey, you break something, too.

1081
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,485
Nice watch.

1082
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,007
It's a family heirloom.

1083
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,931
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1084
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,570
- Who?
- Shrike.

1085
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,927
So, when he was 14,

1086
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,162
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1087
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,926
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1088
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,651
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1089
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,881
And?

1090
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,124
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1091
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,488
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1092
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,130
and presto!

1093
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,969
The card is in the tree.

1094
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,929
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1095
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,490
The card was in the tree.

1096
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,565
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1097
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,564
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1098
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,642
It was to look so far

1099
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,530
that you see 20 years into the past.

1100
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,490
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1101
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,369
What are you suggesting?

1108
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,604
Thank you. Before we begin,

1109
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,728
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1110
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,280
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

1111
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,203
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1112
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,003
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

1113
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,050
Yeah, Agent Rhodes has personally vowed
to "nail us."

1114
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,603
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1115
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,042
What is magic?

1116
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,646
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1117
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,731
So I want you to look.

1118
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,362
Look as closely as possible.

1119
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,489
Because the tricks you are about to see

1120
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,729
may not seem connected.

1121
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,723
But we assure you, they are.

1122
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,490
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1123
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,486
Or is it one giant illusion?

1124
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,124
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1125
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,368
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1126
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,727
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1127
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,925
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1128
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,361
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1129
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,290
and put her inside this mystery box.

1130
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,449
There are two pencils out there.

1131
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,760
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1132
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,330
- Here!
- Yeah!

1133
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,728
And now, you will say the magic word.

1134
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,040
Abracadabra.

1135
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,525
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1136
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,204
for no reason. And then...

1137
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,681
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

1138
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,281
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1139
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,521
you're about to.

1140
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,886
And sleep.

1141
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,804
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1142
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,450
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1143
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,568
And now we are gonna debunk

1144
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,802
a few magic myths this evening.

1145
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,043
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1146
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,891
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1147
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,485
As has the mirror

1148
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,961
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1149
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,122
When you hear the word "freeze"

1150
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,567
you are all football players.

1151
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,566
And your job is to tackle,

1152
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,051
dismantle,

1153
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,401
crush,

1154
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,961
tear limb from limb,

1155
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,089
the quarterback.

1156
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,967
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1157
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,044
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1158
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,920
You will know who the quarterback is.

1159
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,322
He will be the one saying that word.

1160
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,606
Freeze.

1161
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,402
Three, two, one...

1162
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,728
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1163
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,245
Kill the quarterback!

1164
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,924
Get on back to your seats.

1165
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,288
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1166
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,370
I guess you have lost some weight.

1167
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,081
At the intermission,

1168
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,647
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1169
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,205
and seal it in an envelope.

1170
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,930
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1171
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,126
Everyone take 'em out.

1172
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,050
Now, everybody,

1173
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,090
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1174
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,370
Shout 'em out.

1175
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,363
Clement? Frannick?

1176
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,608
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1177
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,648
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1178
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,251
That's me!

1179
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,641
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1180
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,008
Josepha Hickey?

1181
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,081
That's me!

1182
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,084
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1183
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,168
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1184
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,010
One, two, three, four, five...

1185
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,320
Stop.

1186
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,364
Is the first digit 5?

1187
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,407
Yes.

1188
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,845
Do it again. This time, faster.

1189
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,331
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1190
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,481
Stop.

1191
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,725
Six. Again.

1192
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,801
One, two...

1193
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,971
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1194
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,367
Yeah. That's what I got.

1195
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,650
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1196
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,847
Okay, Dina,

1197
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,807
1 ,

1198
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,447
<i>4.</i>

1199
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,161
<i>7,</i>

1200
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,724
-7.
- Yeah.

1201
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,566
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1202
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,801
Clement.

1203
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,890
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1204
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,880
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1205
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,690
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1206
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,650
Focus on your number.

1207
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,963
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1208
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,287
Oh, this is strange.

1209
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,843
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1210
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,883
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1211
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,122
about what you think is in your account.

1212
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,611
Okay, you can sit down now.

1213
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,527
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1214
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,530
This evening would not be possible

1215
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,127
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1216
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,290
Big applause! Big applause!

1217
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,845
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

1218
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,081
for the finale?

1219
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,969
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1220
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,963
There he goes. Okay, good.

1221
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,087
Are we on red?

1222
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,208
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1223
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,770
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

1224
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,001
There he goes.

1225
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,847
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1226
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,763
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1227
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,250
Now, Art, I took a guess.

1228
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,527
North of 140. Am I right?

1229
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,325
That's 140 million, by the way.

1230
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,921
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1231
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,043
How can he be right about his balance

1232
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,281
and everyone else be wrong?

1233
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,768
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1234
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,088
Everybody, take out your paper.

1235
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,811
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1236
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,803
start to warm up that paper.

1237
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,123
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1238
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,969
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1239
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,327
Yes.

1240
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,491
Look.

1241
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,651
What's going on there, Daniel?

1242
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,245
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

1243
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,246
$144,579,651.

1244
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,321
But now...

1245
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,844
Now it says $70,000 less.

1246
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,605
Josepha, can you stand up?

1247
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,761
Yes.

1248
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,650
Now, what is your new number?

1249
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,284
$70,562 now in my account.

1250
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,802
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1251
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,002
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1252
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,646
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1253
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,087
Is it?

1254
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,841
Wow. It is.

1255
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,363
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1256
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,568
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1257
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,566
$281,477.

1258
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,084
We have a confession to make.

1259
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,282
She's right. We lied about something.

1260
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,044
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1261
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,561
All of you have one thing in common.

1262
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,009
Everyone in this room was a victim

1263
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,970
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1264
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,646
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1265
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,081
Your businesses.

1266
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,241
Your loved ones.

1267
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,569
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1268
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,609
Tressler Insurance.

1269
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,881
You were abandoned.

1270
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,041
You were loopholed...

1271
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,360
...out of your settlements.

1272
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,371
This is all for show. Correct?

1273
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,966
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1274
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,884
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1275
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,680
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1276
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,683
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1277
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,089
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1278
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,881
Is this for real?

1279
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,241
I don't know.

1280
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,641
<i>Is this happening?</i>

1281
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,370
I don't know! I can't tell!

1282
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,248
Hey! Did you do this?

1283
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,686
How could we, Art?

1284
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,921
We don't have your password.

1285
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,571
We'd need access to information

1286
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,563
we could never get our hands on.

1287
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,728
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,

1288
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,490
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1289
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,090
or the name of your first pet.

1290
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,924
Where would we get that information, Art?

1291
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,090
You certainly would never tell us.

1292
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,968
<i>We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.</i>

1293
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,725
Do not let them get away.

1294
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,842
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1295
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,131
You got hell to pay!

1296
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,121
Stop!

1297
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,649
Stop! Nobody move!

1298
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,681
Freeze!

1299
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,490
Quarterback!

1300
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,362
We are The Four Horsemen.

1301
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,921
Good night.

1302
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,525
Get 'em off me!

1303
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,884
Get off! Get off me!

1304
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,611
Get off me!

1305
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,207
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1306
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,888
- Quarterback!
- Quarterback!

1307
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,850
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

1308
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,530
and bring the tracker.

1309
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,001
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1310
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,206
Give me the tracker.

1311
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,641
Let's go.

1312
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,086
FBI! Clear!

1313
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,961
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1314
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,041
What have you got?

1315
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,645
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1316
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,769
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1317
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,245
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1318
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,530
Hey! Move!

1319
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,931
Move! Move!

1320
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,329
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1321
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,289
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1322
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,362
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1323
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,484
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1324
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,882
Damn! Where are you?

1325
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,046
Excuse me.

1326
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,122
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1327
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,567
Stop!

1328
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,925
What are you doing?

1329
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,488
He's going in Napoleon House.

1330
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,090
Move! Move!

1331
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,485
Move out of the way!

1332
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,201
Hey!

1333
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,041
Move!

1334
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,647
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1335
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,047
No!No!No!

1336
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,081
Freeze!

1337
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,206
Lower your weapons!

1338
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,561
What?

1339
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,802
I'm tracking myself!

1340
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,288
<i>The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call</i>

1341
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,010
<i>the alphabet agencies,</i>

1342
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,281
<i>calling into question</i>

1343
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,641
<i>the efficacy of the FBI's task force</i>

1344
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,491
<i>as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,</i>

1345
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,050
<i>Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,</i>

1346
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,770
<i>who was publicly ridiculed,</i>

1347
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,770
<i>and even tackled at tonight's performance.</i>

1348
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,360
<i>Talk about a fumble.</i>

1349
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,283
<i>This is quickly becoming a national story,</i>

1350
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,370
<i>as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible</i>

1351
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,887
<i>for the second time in as many days.</i>

1352
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,849
<i>Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen</i>

1353
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,325
<i>seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...</i>

1354
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,801
Hey-

1355
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,086
What are you doing?

1356
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,571
I'm having a drink.

1357
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,005
I came to get you.

1358
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,806
I'm worried about you.

1359
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,485
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1360
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,726
Atlas. You had him.

1361
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,086
He didn't have a weapon.

1362
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,650
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1363
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,604
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1364
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,000
Didn't you?

1365
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,244
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

1366
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,049
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1367
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,246
Let go of my arm.

1368
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,004
Who exactly are you anyway?

1369
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,162
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1370
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,440
Not bad.

1371
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,361
What is this?

1372
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,845
What's the Eye of Horus?

1373
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,004
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1374
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,691
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1375
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,362
Find your way back yourself.

1376
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,523
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

1377
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,007
Sir.

1378
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,440
Thank you.

1379
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,047
What is your role with them?

1380
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,201
Role?

1381
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,129
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1382
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,009
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1383
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,884
If it makes you feel any better,

1384
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,206
this wasn't about you.

1385
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,762
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1386
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,091
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1387
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,681
Played out on a global scale.

1388
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:08,011
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1389
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,370
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1390
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,724
I was a $140-million distraction?

1391
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,721
Yes.

1392
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,564
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1393
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,565
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1394
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,245
- You know...
-"I can destroy you."

1395
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,771
Yes, I do know.

1396
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,246
Well, you won't.

1397
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,962
And you won't destroy them.

1398
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,128
Whatever this grand trick is,

1399
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,205
it was designed a long time ago.

1400
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,968
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1401
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,362
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1402
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,485
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1403
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,728
Whatever you stand to make

1404
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,401
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1405
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,011
And destroy them.

1406
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,402
I stand to make five million.

1407
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,360
Am I flinching?

1408
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,084
No, you're not.

1409
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,006
Hey-

1410
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,601
I'm sorry for your arm.

1411
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,250
No. I'm sorry.

1412
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,607
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1413
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,166
I'm at a loss.

1414
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,484
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1415
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,848
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1416
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,851
So what's this all about?

1417
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,245
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1418
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,685
The Eye are the keepers

1419
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,966
of real magic

1420
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,964
and the protectors of those who practice it.

1421
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,963
"Candidates for initiations

1422
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,203
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

1423
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,409
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1424
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,405
<i>May n</i>

1425
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:24,524
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

1426
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,002
So what? The Horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing?

1427
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,320
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1428
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:34,406
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1429
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,801
They don't have to put on a show for that.

1430
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,405
It's probably just a myth.

1431
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,610
But it doesn't make any sense,
and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

1432
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,286
- You don't say?
- No.

1433
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,162
I believe
that some things are only discovered

1434
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,643
if you take certain leaps.

1435
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,769
- Well, I gotta get to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1436
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,002
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1437
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,889
- Sorry.
-It's all right.

1438
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,847
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

1439
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,206
Shit.

1440
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,886
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

1441
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,964
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

1442
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,728
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

1443
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,126
A bug.

1444
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,046
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1445
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,486
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1446
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,442
God damn it!

1447
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,609
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1448
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,445
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1449
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,361
Picture's up.

1450
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,604
Okay, fast forward.

1451
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,450
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1452
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,009
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1453
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,927
Play it through.

1454
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,361
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1455
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,609
There. That's where he took my phone.

1456
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,086
Is that thing transmitting?

1457
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,651
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1458
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,807
Plus I removed the bug.

1459
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,450
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1460
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,489
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1461
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,682
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1462
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,922
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1463
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,651
Find my real phone and track it.

1464
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,082
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1465
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,327
Good.

1466
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,404
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1467
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,606
They got power? Cut it.

1468
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,088
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

1469
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,327
Squeeze 'em out.

1470
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,164
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1471
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,765
And get me an airplane!

1472
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,363
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1473
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,407
They who?

1474
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,289
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

1475
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,641
Who are we working for?

1476
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,842
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1477
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,921
Stop being paranoid.

1478
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,241
It really does happen.

1479
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,044
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1480
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,730
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

1481
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,131
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1482
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,009
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

1483
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,286
wanting to be treated like an adult.

1484
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,521
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1485
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,807
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

1486
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,086
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1487
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,247
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1488
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,800
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1489
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,282
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1490
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,522
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1491
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,848
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1492
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,968
Hey, guys. They're here.

1493
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,802
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1494
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,211
- No.
- What?

1495
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,486
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1496
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,006
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1497
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,081
She stays.

1498
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,446
What? What?

1499
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,521
Stay in the car.

1500
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,006
Let's go.

1501
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,687
Okay. Let's do it.

1502
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,121
FBI!

1503
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,731
Ladies first.

1504
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,526
Don't move!

1505
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,005
Tell me.

1506
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,849
Is my money being well-spent?

1507
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,283
Exceedingly well.

1508
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,530
Now you tell me,

1509
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,004
how do you like your Horsemen?

1510
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,208
Fricasseed or fried?

1511
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,487
Shredded.

1512
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,050
I'll tell the Chef.

1513
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,601
Freeze!

1514
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,801
Dylan!

1515
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,921
Hold on!

1516
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,287
You little...

1517
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,801
Come here!

1518
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,483
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1519
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,921
You little shit!

1520
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,241
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1521
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,608
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1522
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,728
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1523
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,402
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

1524
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,121
Hey!

1525
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,080
Come here!

1526
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,241
Come here!

1527
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,004
All right, hold on, hold on!

1528
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,763
- Really?
- Yup.

1529
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,961
You...

1530
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,250
You little...

1531
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,327
Shit!

1532
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,767
Shit!

1533
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,525
Give me that!

1534
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,488
<i>All units, cover the north exit now!</i>

1535
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,846
Clear on Evan.

1536
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,763
<i>Block every possible exit.</i>

1537
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,365
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1538
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,002
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1539
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,081
What?

1540
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,804
Stop! Stop!

1541
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,007
Hey!

1542
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,762
Good. Follow him!

1543
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,928
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

1544
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,331
I didn't have tactical command.

1545
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,801
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

1546
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,450
Promise me, next time, you will back me up.

1547
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,608
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

1548
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,250
No!

1549
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,607
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

1550
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,566
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

1551
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,324
I don't know. She just took some guy's car.

1552
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,845
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

1553
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:39,967
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

1554
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,525
Let's go.

1555
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,121
There he is!

1556
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,001
Move!

1557
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,447
Left!

1558
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,569
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1559
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,483
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1560
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,608
- We're heading north on the FDR Drive.
- What?

1561
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,802
<i>We're coming to you live above the FDR,</i>

1562
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,804
<i>where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,</i>

1563
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,803
<i>are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,</i>

1564
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,120
<i>following a black sedan.</i>

1565
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,281
<i>Fuller, where are you?</i>

1566
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,369
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

1567
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,488
<i>We're now trying to get you a better shot.</i>

1568
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,041
Come on!

1569
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,966
<i>It looks like they're turning</i>

1570
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,168
<i>onto the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

1571
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,804
<i>As soon as we have them within range,</i>

1572
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,723
<i>we will bring you those pictures live.</i>

1573
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,440
Good. Just stay with him.

1574
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,040
Go, go, go!

1575
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,610
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1576
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,247
Get over!

1577
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,881
Oh, shit!

1578
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,561
Come here!

1579
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,245
Get back! Get back!

1580
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,006
Dylan, let's go, man!

1581
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,241
Come on, you...

1582
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,768
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1583
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,251
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1584
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,243
Let's go! Leave him!

1585
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,405
'The Paper!
- Dylan!

1586
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,563
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1587
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,004
<i>Today, the unfolding story of a popular
and controversial group of magicians,</i>

1588
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,122
<i>who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,</i>

1589
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,522
<i>took a dark turn when a police action
that began in Chinatown</i>

1590
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,400
<i>developed into a dramatic, high-speed
chase across the 59th Street Bridge,</i>

1591
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,450
<i>which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,</i>

1592
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,841
<i>one of the so-called Four Horsemen.</i>

1593
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,125
<i>The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.</i>

1594
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,685
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

1595
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,046
So they know what it is?

1596
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,849
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1597
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,604
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1598
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,250
Let's go.

1599
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,606
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1600
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,681
What's that?

1601
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,047
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1602
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,800
Rhodes.

1603
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,530
You do understand the function

1604
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,728
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1605
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,525
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1606
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,806
while he sets up the trick.

1607
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,242
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1608
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,404
<i>While you're watching the magician,</i>

1609
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,481
<i>that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.</i>

1610
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,849
<i>Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you</i>

1611
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,367
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1612
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,002
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1613
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,323
She was assigned to the case.

1614
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,611
Luck of the draw.

1615
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,289
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1616
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,001
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1617
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,241
What's in it for you?

1618
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,243
Just trying to even the game.

1619
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,445
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1620
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,366
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1621
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,281
Hey-

1622
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,800
We got a problem.

1623
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,041
Here's the safe.

1624
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,565
No, no, no. Hey.

1625
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,966
What's he doing here?

1626
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,724
Giving us our first solid lead.

1627
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,689
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

1628
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,921
called Elkhorn

1629
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,968
-for the last five years.
- And?

1630
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,724
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1631
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,246
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1632
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,961
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1633
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,646
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1634
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,723
The magician who died on the bridge...

1635
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,282
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1636
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,642
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1637
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,809
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1638
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,120
How did they get the file?

1639
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,401
This is the part you're gonna find

1640
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,448
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1641
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,961
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1642
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,327
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

1643
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,004
with codes they got from your phone.

1644
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,003
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1645
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,006
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1646
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,606
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1647
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,921
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1648
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,249
Boss, he's taking over?

1649
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,802
Let's go, gentlemen.

1650
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,571
Hey-

1651
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,085
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1652
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,361
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1653
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,488
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1654
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,722
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1655
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,245
Do you understand it?

1656
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,367
Yes.

1657
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,721
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1658
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,201
If I find out that you are anything other than

1659
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,566
who you say you are, I swear...

1660
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,489
And we French also have an expression.

1661
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,004
"Faith can move mountains."

1662
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,764
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1663
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,683
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1664
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,922
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1665
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,765
I just got my ass handed to me.

1666
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,365
I am losing this case.

1667
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,802
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1668
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,241
<i>More than anything in his life,</i>

1669
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:38,690
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

1670
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,171
And I can't say he achieved it,

1671
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:44,211
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

1672
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,281
But the point is... Sorry.

1673
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,850
The point is...

1674
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:56,121
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... We cannot quit now.

1675
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,771
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

1676
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,683
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

1677
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,801
<i>Approaching the warehouse.</i>

1678
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,406
<i>Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.</i>

1679
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,720
<i>We are going for the vault.</i>

1680
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,724
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1681
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:27,921
What is this?

1682
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,365
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1683
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,329
We just moved it while you were outside.

1684
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,561
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1685
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,721
I never said that.

1686
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,131
Sir, you got a phone call

1687
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,844
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1688
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,002
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

1689
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:39,763
What happened?

1690
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,567
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1691
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,721
No!

1692
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,090
Jesus Christ.

1693
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,290
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1694
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,249
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto in D-Major.

1695
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,321
Where's the safe?

1696
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,481
His team is loading the truck.

1697
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,444
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1698
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,161
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1699
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,322
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1700
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,849
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1701
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,684
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1702
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,449
Okay. Here's what I want.

1703
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,761
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1704
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,126
So we stay with it.

1705
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,123
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

1706
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,481
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1707
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,810
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1708
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,126
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1709
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,206
You two are with me.

1710
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,080
Guys.

1711
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,520
Look. Office just called with this.

1712
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,483
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1713
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,487
<i>The point of why we're here

1714
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,563

<i>We've started something

1716
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,970

<i>Remember the name Jack Wilder

1718
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,569
<i>5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.</i>

1719
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,881
Their show is in a half an hour.

1720
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,246
It's exactly where we're headed.

1721
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,528
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1722
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,688
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1723
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,411
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1724
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,082
<i>A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz</i>

1725
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:35,006
<i>as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.</i>

1726
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,491
<i>The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round</i>

1727
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,767
<i>of their three-act face-off with the FBI.</i>

1728
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:42,608
<i>What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.</i>

1729
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,161
<i>AH eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.</i>

1730
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,611
Copy that.

1731
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,603
<i>Agents Rhodes, Fuller?</i>

1732
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,281
Go, for us.

1733
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,091
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1734
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,690
<i>It's a woman.</i>

1735
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,606
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1736
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,885
What the hell's going on?

1737
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,281
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1738
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,447
Put your guns down.

1739
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,484
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1740
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,641
Are you kidding?

1741
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,563
I'm following them, just like you are.

1742
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,244
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1743
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,049
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1744
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,764
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1745
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,610
Your ass is mine.

1746
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,564
You guys are still idiots.

1747
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,807
Yeah?

1748
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,006
This happens to be the former

1749
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:54,168
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1750
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,443
It's where I did my first show.

1751
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:59,450
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1752
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,926
why not open it?

1753
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,930
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1754
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,850
would you mind reenacting your look

1755
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,963
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1756
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,202
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1757
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,800
Open the safe.

1758
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,370
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1759
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:18,767
What the hell?

1760
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,286
What?

1761
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,601
Give me that.

1762
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,847
No.

1763
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,001
No!

1764
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,687
What is this?

1765
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,801
Get back!

1766
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,528
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1767
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,521
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1768
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,043
Once again, misdirection.

1769
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,650
The show is starting. Move out!

1770
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,246
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1771
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,848
"What happened to the real one?"

1772
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,244
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1773
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,924
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1774
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,209
FBI! Give me a path!

1775
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,410
Clear out! Clear out!

1776
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,045
<i>What is magic?</i>

1777
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,927
<i>Magic is deception.</i>

1778
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,769
<i>But deception designed to delight,</i>

1779
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,684
<i>to entertain, to inspire.</i>

1780
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,247
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1781
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,681
<i>It is about belief.</i>

1782
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,761
<i>Faith.</i>

1783
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,881
<i>Trust.</i>

1784
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,291
<i>Without those qualities,</i>

1785
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,762
<i>magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.</i>

1786
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,203
<i>But what happens if these qualities</i>

1787
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,368
<i>are not used for their higher purpose?</i>

1788
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,370
<i>And instead they're used to cheat, lie.</i>

1789
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,801
<i>For personal gain or for greed.</i>

1790
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,610
<i>Then it's no longer magic.</i>

1791
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,881
<i>It's crime.</i>

1792
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,084
<i>So tonight, for our final act,</i>

1793
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,004
<i>you're gonna help us set a few things right.</i>

1794
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,281
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1795
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,721
I don't know.

1796
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:24,961
Showtime.

1797
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,161
Look!

1798
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,403
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1799
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,766
Go, go, go!

1800
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,811
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1801
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,447
What are you doing here?

1802
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,641
They're going in the wrong direction

1803
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,847
and you know it.

1804
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,441
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1805
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,928
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1806
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,841
Wait.

1807
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,281
I'm going to go with her.

1808
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,726
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1809
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,607
Go ahead!

1810
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,170
That's on you, Fuller.

1811
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,610
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1812
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,801
Daniel?

1813
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,801
Yeah?

1814
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:39,562
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1815
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,082
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1816
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,965
I'd like to express a sentiment

1817
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,644
to you about our relationship.

1818
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:48,927
Okay.

1819
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,802
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1820
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,641
dick.

1821
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,207
And?

1822
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,650
No, that's it.

1823
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,927
That's very nice.

1824
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,490
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1825
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,130
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1826
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,924
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1827
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,087
Oh. you!

1828
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,330
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1829
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:15,686
We're on our own.

1830
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,410
Our instructions run out after the show.

1831
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,209
Even if there is no "Eye,"

1832
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,009
if we were completely played and we spend

1833
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,122
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1834
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,364
I just want to say that...

1835
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,967
I know. Me, too.

1836
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,243
Little too sentimental for me.

1837
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,281
There they are!

1838
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,045
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1839
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,161
Grab 'em!

1840
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,207
Get up!

1841
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:54,846
What the hell?

1842
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,801
Shit!

1843
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,240
Hello, New York!

1844
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,688
Thank you for the magic.

1845
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,961
And thank you for being such

1846
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,084
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1847
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,482
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1848
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,369
it must come to an end.

1849
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,560
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1850
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,210
By saying goodbye.

1851
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:38,925
All we wanted was to

1852
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,968
bring the world to a magic show.

1853
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,530
And thereby bring a little magic

1854
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,761
back to the world.

1855
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,921
Clear the way!

1856
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,889
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1857
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,761
But it's time for us to disappear.

1858
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,285
Good night, New York.

1859
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,965
And thank you for believing in us.

1860
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,726
Stop!

1861
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,241
Freeze!

1862
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:17,846
No!

1863
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,251
God damn it!

1864
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,046
I'm sorry.

1865
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,722
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1866
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:14,765
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1867
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,730
So I guess this is it.

1868
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,921
Is it?

1869
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,326
Dylan!

1870
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:52,166
Dylan! Dylan!

1871
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:53,287
Hey-

1872
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:56,608
- You see that?
- What?

1873
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,605
Where's the real money?

1874
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:21,811
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1875
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,126
I've been framed.

1876
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,527
I'm sure you were.

1877
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,886
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1878
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,640
I always do.

1879
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,968
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1880
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,566
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1881
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,962
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1882
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,680
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1883
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,603
Sure.

1884
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,607
All right.

1885
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,290
I got information to trade.

1886
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,561
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1887
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,404
If it's of some value.

1888
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,043
These bars give a man time to think.

1889
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,528
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1890
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,088
<i>Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?</i>

1891
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,083
<i>The box was never empty.</i>

1892
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,601
<i>The room wasn't either.</i>

1893
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:06,281
<i>After gaining access to the warehouse,</i>

1894
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,682
<i>The Horsemen left the real safe</i>

1895
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,206
<i>and transformed the whole room</i>

1896
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,760
<i>into a giant rabbit box.</i>

1897
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,522
<i>You go charging in there,</i>

1898
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,206
<i>thinking the safe was already gone.</i>

1899
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,407
Hey!

1900
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,811
Hey! Stop!

1901
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,411
Missing the trick. Again.

1902
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,527
Which was to make you think

1903
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,325
the safe had already been stolen,

1904
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,641
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1905
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,170
<i>Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,</i>

1906
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,966
<i>someone was breaking into the warehouse.</i>

1907
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,641
<i>Who?</i>

1908
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,570
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

1909
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,651
Holy shit.

1910
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,241
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1911
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,168
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1912
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,766
It's locked.

1913
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,766
Weren't you listening?

1914
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:18,321
Nothing's ever locked.

1915
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:22,530
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1916
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,523
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1917
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,047
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1918
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,205
<i>Led you to the bridge.</i>

1919
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:34,044
<i>Where the other Horsemen were waiting</i>

1920
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,089
<i>with an identical replacement car.</i>

1921
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:38,081
<i>It only took a split second</i>

1922
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,167
<i>for you to lose contact with it</i>

1923
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,241
<i>and make the switch.</i>

1924
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,564
<i>When you crawled into that burning car,</i>

1925
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,922
<i>quite heroically, I might add,</i>

1926
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,882
<i>you almost died trying to rescue</i>

1927
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,964
<i>what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.</i>

1928
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:20,166
<i>Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan</i>

1929
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,405
just to frame one guy?

1930
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:23,767
I don't know.

1931
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,331
They never kept any of the money they took.

1932
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,846
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1933
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,605
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1934
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,444
- No. Not really.
- What?

1935
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:37,082
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1936
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,125
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1937
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:44,607
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1938
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,006
Tressler Insurance.

1939
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,161
The bank that carried the note?

1940
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,930
Credit Republican of Paris.

1941
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,770
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1942
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,531
What do you make of that?

1943
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,762
A sucker is born every minute.

1944
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:03,126
What if all this was just leading up to

1945
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,931
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1946
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,685
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1947
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,886
We just have to find...

1948
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,086
That?

1949
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,329
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1950
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,806
And the card encased in glass.

1951
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,770
What do we do now?

1952
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,845
Oh, nice!

1953
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,165
<i>So, here's my new theory.</i>

1954
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:01,082
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

1955
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,921
Waiting

1956
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:07,086
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1957
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,849
from the mediocre ones.

1958
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,886
Maybe that was you.

1959
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,761
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1960
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:17,491
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1961
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:20,723
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1962
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,690
You pissed them off.

1963
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,449
The Eye isn't real.

1964
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,603
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1965
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,211
Somebody with an obsession.

1966
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,885
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1967
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:37,282
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1968
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,966
Somebody so prepared to lose

1969
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,520
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1970
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:45,450
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1971
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,210
I don't know who.

1972
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,807
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1973
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,211
to plant the mirrors.

1974
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,406
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1975
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,723
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1976
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,691
Almost as if they were on the...

1977
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:16,971
The inside.

1978
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,127
You.

1979
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:35,761
Why?

1980
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,921
That is the question, isn't it?

1981
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,330
You're right.

1982
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,287
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1983
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,328
to see the look on your face.

1984
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,285
Who are you?

1985
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,771
What do you want from me?

1986
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,125
What do I want?

1987
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,444
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1988
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:02,525
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1989
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,283
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1990
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,281
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1991
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,125
when you were always two steps behind.

1992
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,006
Dylan?

1993
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,961
Wait a minute.

1994
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,162
Dylan! How did this happen?

1995
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,484
Dylan!

1996
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,601
Why?

1997
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,321
Why?

1998
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,482
Oh, my God.

1999
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,369
I did not see that coming.

2000
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,766
That's impossible!

2001
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:46,841
No way.

2002
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,321
That was actually pretty good.

2003
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,841
Thank you.

2004
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,481
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

2005
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,607
We were in agreement.

2006
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,001
Okay. Right.

2007
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,401
Henley.

2008
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:00,003
I've never seen her speechless.

2009
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,684
I take that as a huge compliment.

2010
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,051
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

2011
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,365
Hey, listen, for the record,

2012
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:11,047
I have always been a 100% believer.

2013
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,441
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

2014
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,648
these infidels on point...

2015
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,768
Merritt, you're in.

2016
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:19,681
God bless.

2017
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:20,847
Come.

2018
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:25,043
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

2019
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:27,129
and making them all work together.

2020
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,681
And that's exactly what you did.

2021
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:31,721
So welcome.

2022
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,088
Welcome to the Eye.

2023
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,362
It was all connected.

2024
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,004
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

2025
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,691
And Elkhorn?

2026
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,723
What's the connection to Shrike?

2027
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:08,443
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

2028
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,888
They used cheap steel.

2029
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:13,766
They cut corners.

2030
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,083
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

2031
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,525
And he was trapped.

2032
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,650
He was your father.

2033
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,888
<i>The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.</i>

2034
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:32,926
<i>When my father said he had to go to work,
he could see that I didn't want him to leave.</i>

2035
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:40,291
<i>So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.</i>

2036
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:44,165
<i>I have never let his watch stop since then.</i>

2037
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:46,402
And from that moment on,

2038
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:49,006
I created a persona.

2039
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:51,563
I planned. I worked out every detail.

2040
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,928
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

2041
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,521
was you.

2042
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:01,170
And I know that
the logical conclusion for you

2043
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:04,405
is to take this case to its resolution.

2044
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,529
And for you to turn me in.

2045
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:13,727
Yeah.

2046
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:19,526
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

2047
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,211
And you also know

2048
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:27,449
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

2049
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,729
One more secret to lock away.

2050
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,805
<i>Come in close.</i>

2051
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,566
<i>Closer.</i>

2052
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,881
<i>Because now you know our secret.</i>

2053
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,327
<i>We could be anywhere. Watching you.</i>

2054
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:15,561
<i>We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.</i>

2055
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,211
<i>On the count of three, open your eyes</i>

2056
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,248
<i>and tell me what you see.</i>

2057
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:22,321
One.

2058
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,441
<i>Two...</i>

2059
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,169
Please, stop, stop, stop.

2060
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:01,241
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

2061
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,730
Oh, thank God.

2062
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:07,762
Where are we?

2063
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,241
Great, another shit hole.

2064
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,243
Okay, feeling it.

2065
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:16,524
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

2066
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,449
Check out this place.

2067
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,330
- Where'd you bring us?
- Was there no landfill where we were?

2068
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,289
This place is awesome.

2069
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:26,801
Is this our new gear?

2070
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,450
There'd better not be, like,
matching jumpsuits in there.

2071
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:29,567
You know I don't wear spandex.

2072
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:32,041
It's locked.
- Guys, the cards.

2073
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:34,646
- What card?
- What do you mean, "what card"?

2074
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:39,761
Okay.
