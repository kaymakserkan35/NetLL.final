00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,660
Mom.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,600
Mom is a babe.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,300
Are you a hunter?

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,560
Hey,winchester! son of a bitch! how you doin',corporal?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,630
Hey,mr. d.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,060
Dad?

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,530
This is gonna sound a little crazy.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,200
Mary is my mother. excuse me?

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,400
And I am your grandson.

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,660
My parents are mary and John winchester.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,900
I don't know  mary gets killed by a yellow-eyed demon.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,830
You don't want those people's souls.

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,900
No,i just want their children. why any of them?

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm gonna stand over their crib,

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,000
and I'm gonna bleed into their mouths.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,030
So,you've been using your freaky e.s.p. stuff?

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,860
No. sure about that?

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,850
Look,you didn't want me to go down that road,

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,230
So I didn't go down that road.

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,500
Well,let's keep it that way.

21
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,200
We know what azazel did to your brother.

22
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,800
What we don't know is why.

23
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,240
Your brother is heading down a dangerous road,dean,so stop it...

24
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,650
 so stop it...

25
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,630
Or we will.

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,560
Where's lilith?

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,960
Kiss my ass.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,260
I'd watch myself if I were you.

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,430
Why? huh?

30
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,600
Because you're sam winchester,mr. big hero?

31
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:29,460
And yet here you are,slutting around with some demon.

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,230
Real hero. shut your mouth.

33
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,500
Tell me about those months without your brother...

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,900
About all the things you and this demon bitch do in the dark.

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,900
Huh? tell me,hero.

How'd it feel?

42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,960
Good. no more headaches. none?

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,830
That is good.

44
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,360
I got you. it's all right.

So...

46
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,100
Anything you want to tell me,sam?

47
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,790
Dean,hold on,okay? just let me

48
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,460
you gonna say,"let me explain"?

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,260
You're gonna explain this?

50
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,360
How about this?

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,530
Why don't you start with who she is

52
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,660
 and what the hell is she doing here?

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,660
It's good to see you again,dean.

54
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,830
Ruby?

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,130
Is that ruby?

56
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,830
Don't!

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,400
Ruby,stop it.

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,430
Well,aren't you an obedient little bitch?

59
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,030
Ruby.

60
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,560
Ruby...he's hurt.

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,060
Go.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,300
Where the hell do you think you're going?

63
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,160
The e.r...unless you want to go another round first.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,960
Dean.

65
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,030
Dean!

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,360
Dean,what are you doing?

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,060
What,are you -- are you leaving?

68
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,260
You don't need me. you and ruby go fight demons.

69
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,560
Hold on. dean,come on,man.

70
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,530
You satisfied?

71
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,160
I guess not.

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,960
Do you even know how far off the reservation you've gone?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,860
How far from normal? from human?

74
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,630
I'm just exorcising demons.

75
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,960
With your mind!

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,330
What else can you do?

77
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,060
I can send them back to hell.

78
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,200
It only works with demons,and that's it.

79
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,130
What else can you do?! I told you!

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,200
And I have every reason in the world to believe that.

81
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,100
Look,i should have said something.

82
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,330
I'm sorry,dean. I am.

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,860
But try to see the other side here. the other side?!

84
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm pulling demons out of innocent people. use the knife!

85
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,160
The knife kills the victim!

86
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,930
What I do,most of them survive!

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,240
Look,

88
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,800
I've saved more people in the last five months

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,360
 than we save in a year.

90
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,600
That what ruby wants you to think?

91
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,480
Kind of like the way she tricked you

92
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,530
 into using your powers?

93
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,700
Slippery slope,brother.

94
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,400
Just wait and see.

95
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,190
Because it's gonna get darker and darker,

96
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,960
and god knows where it ends.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm not gonna let it go too far.

98
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,060
It's already gone too far,sam.

99
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,230
If I didn't know you...

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,660
...i would want to hunt you.

101
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,230
And so would other hunters.

102
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,260
You were gone.

103
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,100
I was here.

104
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,960
I had to keep on fighting without you.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,430
And what I'm doing...

106
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,130
It works.

107
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,860
Well,tell me.

108
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,930
If it's so terrific...

109
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,560
Then why'd you lie about it to me?

110
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,960
Why did an angel tell me to stop you?

111
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,960
What?

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Cas said that if I don't stop you,he will.

113
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,160
See,what that means,

114
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,460
Sam -- that means that god doesn't want you doing this.

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,650
So,are you just gonna stand there and

116
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,800
 and tell me that everything is all good?

117
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,130
Hello?

118
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,060
Hey,travis. yeah,hey.

119
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,060
Uh...it's good to hear your voice,too,yeah.

120
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,800
Um,look,it's not a really good time right now.

121
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,460
Yeah,okay.

122
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,400
Uh,well,just give me the details,and,uh carthage,missouri.

123
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,830
Looking for jack montgomery.

124
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,330
Jack,are you stoned?

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,660
What? it's good. I'm starving.

126
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,930
Is...is there dessert?

127
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,360
It just so happens.

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
Hey,babe?

129
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,230
Hmm? are you gonna finish your steak?

130
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,560
You're kidding,right? you've had two already.

131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,160
I don't know. I'm just...hungry.

132
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,830
Or you have tapeworm.

133
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,060
Please.

134
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,500
I never felt better.

135
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,630
I can't believe it. mom  a hunter?

136
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,400
I wouldn't have believed it,either,if I hadn't seen it myself.

137
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,600
That woman could kick some ass.

138
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,300
I mean,she almost took me down.

139
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,660
How'd she look?

140
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,860
I mean...was she happy?

141
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,330
Yeah,she was awesome.

142
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
Funny and smart.

143
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,630
So hopeful.

144
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,430
Dad,too.

145
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,700
Until,of course...

146
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,400
What?

147
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,160
Nothing.

148
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,030
It's just our parents,and now we find out our grandparents,too?

149
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,160
Our whole family murdered,and for what?

150
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,930
So yellow eyes could get in my nursery and bleed in my mouth?

151
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,960
Sam,i never said anything about demon blood.

152
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,400
You knew about that?

153
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,860
Yeah,for about a year.

154
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,360
A whole year.

155
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
I should have told you. I'm sorry.

156
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,700
You've been saying that a lot lately,sam.

157
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,500
But whatever.

158
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,530
You don't want to tell me,you don't have to.

159
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,430
-It's fine. -dean.

160
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,300
Whatever.

161
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,030
Hey,babe,when's dinner?

162
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,460
45 minutes.

163
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,430
I'm starving!

164
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,530
Jack,a delicious,unmicrowaved,non-takeout,homemade meal is coming.

165
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,200
Are you sure that's him?

166
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,300
Only jack montgomery in town.

167
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,400
And we're looking for...?

168
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,230
Travis said to keep an eye out for anything weird.

169
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,300
Weird?

170
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,060
Yeah.

171
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,610
All right,well,yeah,I've seen big weird,little weird,

172
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,300
Weird with crazy on top.

173
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,700
But this guy? I mean,come on,this guy's boring.

174
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,200
I don't know,dean. travis seemed pretty sure.

175
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,940
Honey

176
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,730
I'd say that qualifies as weird.

177
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,160
Travis.

178
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,600
See,sam. told you we should have hid the beer.

179
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,660
Smartass. get over here!

180
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,230
Ohh,good to see you.

181
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,960
-You too. -good to see you.

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,660
You too,travis.

183
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,330
Man,you got tall,kid.

184
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,800
How long has it been?

185
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh,got to be 10 years.

186
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,060
You still a -- oh,what was it? a mathlete?

187
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,460
No.

188
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,400
Yep,sure is.

189
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,630
Been too long,boys.

190
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,660
I mean,look at you -- grown men.

191
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,660
John would have been damn proud of you...

192
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,800
Sticking together like this.

193
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,300
Yeah. yeah,we're as thick as thieves.

194
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,260
Nothing more important than family.

195
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,060
Sorry I'm late for the dance.

196
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,300
Thanks for helping out an old man.

197
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm a little,uh,shorthanded.

198
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,100
So,you track down montgomery?

199
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,130
-Yeah,we found him at his home. -and?

200
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,390
Well,he had a hell of a case of the munchies,

201
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,930
Topped off with a burger that he forgot to cook.

202
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,100
That's him,all right. what's him?

203
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,560
Boys,we got a rougarou on our hands.

204
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,700
A rougarou?

205
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,330
Is that made up? that sounds made up.

206
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,100
They're mean,nasty little suckers -- rotted teeth,wormy skin,the works.

207
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,160
Well,that ain't this guy.

208
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,860
I mean,he was wearing a cellphone on his belt.

209
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,030
He'll turn ugly soon enough.

210
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,260
They start out human,for all intents and purposes.

211
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,500
So,what,they go through some kind of metamorphosis?

212
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,830
Yep,like a maggot turning into a bull fly.

213
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,560
But most of all,they're hungry.

214
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,260
Hungry for what?

215
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,700
At first,for everything,but then for long pig.

216
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,360
Long pig?

217
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,630
He means human flesh.

218
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,930
And that is my word of the day.

219
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,450
Hunger grows in till they can't fight it,

220
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,060
Till they got to take themselves a big,juicy chomp,and then it happens.

221
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,400
What happens?

222
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,900
They transform completely and fast.

223
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,400
I think I need stitches.

224
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,000
I got to go.

225
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,330
What?

226
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,000
I got to get out of here.

227
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,830
Where are you going? jack?!

228
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,030
One bite's all it takes yes,teeth,skin all turns.

229
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,660
No going back,either.

230
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,130
They feed once,they're a monster forever.

231
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,000
And our man jack's headed there on a bullet train.

232
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,930
Well,how'd you find this guy if he's a walking,talking human?

233
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,100
Let's just say it runs in his family.

234
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,600
You mean,uh...

235
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,530
Killed his daddy back in '78.

236
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,830
Son of a bitch mangled eight bodies before I put him down.

237
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,560
Guy used to be a dentist dillac,trophy wife.

238
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,230
Little did I know,pregnant trophy wife.

239
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,430
She put the boy up for adoption.

240
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,500
By the time I found out,he was long gone,lost in the system.

241
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,800
You mean to tell me you couldn't find someone?

242
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,430
I'm not sure I wanted to.

243
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,460
The idea of hunting down some poor kid...

244
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,360
I don't think I'd have had the heart.

245
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,330
No. wanted to wait,make damn sure I had the right man.

246
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Apparently,i do.

247
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,630
One more,please.

248
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,660
Can I get some more peanuts?

249
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,400
Come on. what are you drinking?

250
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,700
It's my treat.

251
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,860
No,thank you.

252
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,030
Oh,don't be like that. have a drink with me.

253
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,660
I'm waiting for someone.

254
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,160
-Okay,well,where is he?  -hey,douche bag.

255
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
She doesn't want to talk to you.

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,200
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

257
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,560
I said...

258
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,560
She doesn't want to talk to you,you fat...sweaty...dick.

259
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,360
Now,leave her alone.

260
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
You,uh,seriously want to do this,guy?

261
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,930
You know,I really think I do.

262
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,730
So,fire,huh?

263
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,800
The only way I found to kill these bastards -- deep-fry 'em.

264
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,830
Well,that's gonna be... horrible.

265
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,800
Is that what you did to jack's dad?

266
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,660
Not wasting any time,are you?

267
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,960
None to waste.

268
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,500
The guy hulks out,we won't be finding bodies,just remains.

269
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,200
What if he doesn't hulk out?

270
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,160
I did a little homework.

271
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,630
I've been checking out the lure on rougarous.

272
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,860
What,my 30 years of experience not good enough for you?

273
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,160
What?

274
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,030
No. no,i-i just wanted to be prepared.

275
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,900
I mean,not that you didn't sam loves research. he does.

276
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,600
He keeps it under his mattress right next to his k-y.

277
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,230
It's a sickness. it is.

278
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,720
Look,everything you said checked out,of course,but,uh,

279
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,640
I found a couple of interesting stories about

280
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,760
People who have this rougarou gene or whatever.

281
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,000
See,they start to turn,but they never take the final step. really?

282
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,560
See,if they never eat human flesh,they don't fully transform.

283
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,030
So,what?  go vegan,stay human? basically.

284
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,360
Or in this case,eat a lot of raw meat,just not -- long pig. right.

285
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,900
Good on you for the due diligence,sam.

286
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,260
But those are fairy tales.

287
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,130
Fact is,every rougarou I ever saw or heard of...

288
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,560
Took that bite.

289
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,830
Okay,well,that doesn't mean that jack will.

290
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,230
So,what do we do?

291
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,300
Sit and hope and wait for a body count?

292
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,130
No,we talk to him,explain what's happening.

293
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,460
That way,he can fight it.

294
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,630
Fight it?

295
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,530
Are you kidding me?

296
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,660
You ever been really hungry?

297
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,630
I mean,haven't-eaten-in-days hungry?

298
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Yeah. yeah. right,then.

299
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,230
Somebody slaps a big,juicy sirloin in front of you,you walking away?

300
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,800
That's what we are to him now  meat on legs.

301
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,930
I'm sorry. I'm sure he's a stand-up guy.

302
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,500
But it's pure,base instinct.

303
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,230
Everything in nature's got to eat.

304
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,260
You think he can stop himself 'cause he's nice? I don't know.

305
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,730
But we're not gonna kill him unless he does something to get killed for.

306
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,030
What's up with your brother?

307
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,800
Don't get me started.

308
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,630
God. you scared me.

309
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,860
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

310
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,530
How are you feeling?

311
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,460
I'm feeling pissed,jack.

312
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,860
I had to drive myself to the hospital last night.

313
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,760
I was there until 2:00.

314
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,160
I'm so sorry.

315
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,130
-What happened?  -I don't know.

316
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,030
I saw your blood,and i-i...got dizzy,and I just had to get out.

317
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,160
Well,you could have called. I left you a dozen messages.

318
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,900
I know. my phone died. I couldn't find a pay phone.

319
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,360
I ..it was a mess.

320
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,630
But I am...sorry.

321
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,200
And I promise it won't ever happen again.

322
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,260
Certainly...

323
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,030
Not to a wife as stunning as you.

324
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,200
Better not.

325
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,160
I swear,you know. one little cut.

326
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Blood's never bothered you before.

327
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,400
Well...i've changed.

328
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,300
This doesn't get you off the hook,you know.

329
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,600
No,no. think -- think diamond. think kobe-sized.

330
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,600
What has gotten into you?

331
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,400
I don't know.

332
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,760
Hey,jack. just slow down.

333
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Jack.

334
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,900
Jack,i mean it. stop.

335
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,360
Jack. ow!

336
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,130
Jack! stop!

337
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,530
Stop it! stop it!

338
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,400
You son of bitch.

339
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm sorry.

340
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,460
What the hell is wrong with you?

341
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't know.

342
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,330
I don't know.

343
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,710
All right,so we're gonna go have a little chat with this guy,which,

344
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,960
You know,i'm down.

345
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,300
But I just want to make sure,if push comes,you're gonna shove.

346
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,830
Meaning?

347
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,330
Well,odds are we're gonna have to burn this guy alive.

348
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,200
This guy has a name and a wife.

349
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,660
Yeah,who we're probably gonna make a widow,okay?

350
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,800
I mean,you heard travis.

351
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,130
He's gonna turn. they always turn.

352
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,900
Well,maybe he won't. maybe he can fight it off.

353
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,000
And maybe he can't. that's all I'm saying.

354
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,830
All right,we'll just have to see,then,okay?

355
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,360
This is what I mean,sam.

356
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,800
You sure your emotions aren't getting in the way here?

357
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,160
What are you talking about?

358
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,200
You know,nice dude,but he's got something evil inside.

359
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,760
Something in his blood. maybe you can relate.

360
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,760
Stop the car.

361
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,580
What?

362
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,500
Stop the car or I will

363
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,160
you want to know why I've been lying to you,dean?

364
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,960
Because of crap like this! like what?

365
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,360
The way you talk to me,the way you look at me like I'm a freak!

366
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,460
I do not. you know,or even worse,like I'm an idiot!

367
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,930
Like I don't know the difference between right and wrong!

368
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,400
What?

369
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,060
Do you know the difference,sam?

370
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,860
I mean,you've been kind of strolling a dark road lately.

371
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,660
You have no idea what I'm going through. none.

372
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,730
Then enlighten me!

373
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,500
I've got demon blood in me,dean!

374
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,930
This disease pumping through my veins,

375
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,060
And I can't ever rip it out or scrub it clean!

376
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,330
I'm a whole new level of freak!

377
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,600
And I'm just trying to take this -- this curse...

378
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,730
And make something good out of it.

379
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,560
Because I have to.

380
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,800
Let's just go talk to the guy.

381
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,100
I mean jack. okay?

382
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,730
Jack montgomery?

383
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,730
I'm sam winchester. this is my brother -- dean.

384
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,100
We need to talk.

385
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,730
About?

386
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,660
About you.

387
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,460
About how you're changing.

388
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,430
Excuse me?

389
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,130
You're probably feeling your bones move under your skin...

390
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,600
And your appetite's reaching,you know,hungry hungry hippo levels.

391
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,900
How am I doing so far?

392
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,560
Who the hell are you guys?

393
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,000
We're people who know a little something about something.

394
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,430
We're people who can help.

395
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,700
Please,just hear us out.

396
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,360
A-a what?

397
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,730
A rougarou.

398
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,860
Sounds made-up,i know,but,believe me,it's not.

399
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,160
All right,I've noticed certain things.

400
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,860
I mean,some strange things,but I just  I don't know.

401
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,130
I'm..I'm sick or something.

402
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,330
Your father was one of these things.

403
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,600
Your real father. he passed it on to you.

404
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,330
No.

405
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,930
Are you guys listening to yourselves?

406
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,530
You sound like you're -- skip the whole "you guys sound crazy," shall we?

407
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,860
You're hungry,jack. you're only gonna get hungrier.

408
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,630
Hungrier for?

409
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,160
Long pig.

410
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,600
You know,a little manburger helper may have crossed your mind already.

411
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,800
No.

412
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,400
It doesn't have to be like this,jack.

413
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,260
You can fight it off. others have.

414
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,800
We're not gonna lie to you,though. it's not gonna be easy.

415
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,030
You're gonna feel like an alcoholic swimming around in whiskey.

416
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:55,360
But I'm telling you,you got to say no,or -- or what?

417
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,000
You feed once,and it's all over.

418
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,030
And then we'll have to stop you.

419
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,800
Stop me?

420
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,200
My dad -- did,uh,somebody stop him?

421
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,930
Yes.

422
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,830
Get off my property right now.

423
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,700
I see you guys again,I'm calling the cops.

424
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,330
Jack,your wife,everybody you know,they're in danger.

425
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,400
Now!

426
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,230
Good talk.

427
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,300
Jack,i don't know where you are,but you're scaring me.

428
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,200
Come home. we need to talk.

429
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,830
Please?

430
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,260
Damn it,jack,no!

431
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,060
Come on.

432
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,800
Aah! wait!

433
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,060
Uh,we're here to save you,I guess.

434
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,530
We should go. yeah.

435
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,460
Michelle,i'm home.

436
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,400
Hey,babe?

437
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,160
Are you here?

438
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,400
Michelle.

439
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,530
Michelle?

440
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,630
Okay. we're gonna stay calm.

441
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,430
We're gonna give this man whatever he wants.

442
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,360
Anything. just take it and go,please.

443
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,960
I'm sorry about this,jack.

444
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,960
I truly am.

445
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,530
It's not the way that I wanted it to go.

446
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,160
Who are you?

447
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,630
You already met some friends of mine.

448
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,300
Two brothers?

449
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:43,500
They said that if I -- look,I haven't hurt anybody.

450
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,630
Not yet,but you would've.

451
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,330
They always do.

452
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm doing you a favor,son.

453
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
Jack,what's he talking about?

454
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,130
Tell her,jack.

455
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,800
Tell her the truth. she deserves to know.

456
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,860
Just let her go. she's not a part of this.

457
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,800
A part of what?

458
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,560
Jack?!

459
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,000
I really do apologize,but she is part of it.

460
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,000
What?

461
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,130
Michelle...

462
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,800
...tell him what you told me when I got here.

463
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,600
Michelle?

464
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,800
I said...

465
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,360
"don't hurt me...

466
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,500
Because I'm pregnant."

467
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,660
J-just hold on a minute.

468
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,330
Now you see the mess we're in?

469
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
I can't make this mistake all over again.

470
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,260
I won't be around in 30 years. this has got to end now.

471
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,760
I know you don't believe me,but I'd give anything not to have to do this.

472
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,930
No. no.

473
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,230
No. no.

474
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,430
Oh,god. please don't!

475
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,700
You don't have to do this!

476
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,930
If you want to kill me,kill me,but not my wife.

477
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,430
Okay? I'm begging you.

478
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,600
Ain't got no choice.

479
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,400
My condolences.

480
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,360
Jack.

481
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Jack!

482
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,060
Stay away from me!

483
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,460
Michelle.

484
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,460
I guess now we know where travis is.

485
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,530
That stupid son of a bitch.

486
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,200
Oh,god.

487
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,900
Think that's travis?

488
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,460
What's left of him.

489
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,960
Guess you were right about jack.

490
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,600
Dean!

491
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,030
Dean?

492
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,230
Dean can't come to the phone right now.

493
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,530
Jack! if you hurt him,I swear to god!

494
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,800
Calm down!

495
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,760
Your brother's alive.

496
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,360
But not if you don't calm down!

497
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,860
All right,jack. listen.

498
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,100
Open the door. we can figure this out,okay?

499
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,900
We'll have ourselves a little brainstorming session.

500
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,830
Jack,please.

501
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,430
I don't think so. after what you did?

502
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,660
What? what are you talking about?

503
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,760
You sent your friend here.

504
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,430
He tried to burn my wife alive!

505
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,530
What? why?

506
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,130
He didn't say.

507
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:47,260
I guess psychopaths don't have to explain themselves.

508
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,930
Listen to me. you got to believe me.

509
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,030
My brother and i,we never would have hurt her,okay?

510
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,060
Oh,god,i'm so hungry.

511
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,560
Jack,don't do this.

512
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,930
I can't ever see my family again.

513
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,660
You two...your friend -- you made me into this!

514
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,230
No one's making you kill us.

515
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,430
Listen to me.

516
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,000
You got this dark pit inside you. I know.

517
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,430
Believe me,i know.

518
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,430
But that doesn't mean you have to fall into it.

519
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,330
You don't have to be a monster.

520
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,960
Have you seen me lately?

521
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,930
It doesn't matter what you are. it only matters what you do.

522
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,460
It's your choice.

523
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,400
Jack!

524
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,600
You did the right thing,you know.

525
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,930
That guy was a monster. there was no going back.

526
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,760
Sam,i want to tell you I'm sorry.

527
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,660
I've been kind of hard on you lately.

528
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,260
Don't worry about it,dean.

529
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,880
It's just that your,

530
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,300
Uh -- your psychic thing -- it scares the crap out of me.

531
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,800
If it's all the same,i'd really rather not talk about it.

532
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,730
Wait a minute. what? you don't want to talk? you?

533
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,530
There's nothing more to say.

534
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,700
I can't keep explaining myself to you.

535
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,400
I can't make you understand.

536
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,360
Why don't you try? I can't.

537
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,700
Because th thing,this blood -- it's not in you the way it's in me.

538
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,730
It's just something I got to deal with.

539
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,700
Not alone.

540
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,560
Anyway,it doesn't matter.

541
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,100
These powers -- it's playing with fire.

542
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,430
I'm done with them.

543
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,660
I'm done with everything.

544
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,230
Really?

545
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,160
Well,that's a relief.

546
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,830
Thank you.

547
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,030
Don't thank me. I'm not doing it for you.

548
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,360
Or for the angels or for anybody.

549
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,400
This is my choice.
