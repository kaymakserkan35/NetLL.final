2
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,440
You okay?

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,540
Yeah, just got clipped
with a beam.

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,110
What the hell do you two think
you were doing?

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,380
We thought we
heard someone in there!

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,180
You never go in
without authorization!

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,250
Captain, this is all me.
Amy just followed me in.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,920
So torching your ass last year
wasn't enough, huh?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,430
You need to stop trying to
prove how tough you are before
you get yourself killed.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,800
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,500
Let the paramedics
look you over.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,940
Come on, Derek.
Let's get this ladder to
the second story. Let's go.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,320
(GASPING)

14
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,580
Derek! Derek!

15
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,620
Derek!

16
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,290
What's happening?

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,260
I'm freezing.

18
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm fine.

19
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,800
ER docs don't think so.

20
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,000
Your temperature's
been going up and down
like a rollercoaster.

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,010
How old are these skin grafts?

22
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,640
Last one was
about six months ago.

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,010
We're gonna run some tests
and we'll get a consult
with Dr. House.

24
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,210
I'll be fine.

25
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,220
You'll be doing
what the doctors say. Got it?

26
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,150
I'll check in later.

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,390
Hey.

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,430
The way you
covered for me last night...

29
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,160
He's my brother.

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,470
I know how to eat it from him.

31
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,770
I'm gonna stop by
after my shift, okay?

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
Okay.

33
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,270
So where is this Dr. House?

34
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,540
Speaking engagement.

35
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,120
Not guilty.

36
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,920
And on the charge of gaining
control of said medication
by fraud, how do you plead?

37
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,720
Not guilty.
Very well.

38
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,820
Preliminary hearing is set for
the 19th at 10:00 a.m.,

39
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,800
at which time I'll determine
whether there's enough
evidence to proceed to trial.

40
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,360
Next case on the calendar.
People versus Williams.

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,200
Charge is assault
in the second degree

42
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,030
with intent to cause injury
to another person.

43
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,270
I see the defense has
submitted a motion
to dismiss...

44
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,940
You gonna go talk to him?

45
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,500
I was just gonna ask him
where he gets his hair cut.

46
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,950
They have your signature
in the prescription log,
a security camera video,

47
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,320
and a pharmacist's sworn
statement saying you stole
a dead guy's pills.

48
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,020
You're already looking
at 10 years.

49
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,860
You wanna add
a witness intimidation charge?

50
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,690
Go ahead, ask him
about his hair.

51
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,100
He suffered third-degree burns
over 54% of his body,
a year ago,

52
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,800
and arrived in
the ER last night,
disoriented and shivering.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,210
For 12 hours his temperature
was bouncing between
96 and 102.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,510
Why don't you contest
the search of
the pharmacy records?

55
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,380
Yeah. You could argue it
violated doctor-patient
confidentiality.

56
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,050
Except he wasn't the patient
or the doctor.

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,250
He was the guy who stole
from the patient
and the doctor!

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,820
This was the third time he'd
been disoriented
in the last two weeks.

59
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,460
Running into smoke-filled
burning buildings
can be a bit disorienting.

60
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,970
Fortunately, I have the cure.
Stop doing it.

61
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,470
He's not in
a burning building anymore,
and he's still shivering.

62
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,800
A hypothalamic tumor
could cause
a vacillating temperature.

63
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,030
So could ER nurses
who were too busy to notice

64
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,440
that a patient likes
both hot coffee
and cold sodas.

65
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,520
He tested negative for Hep C,
TB, HIV, Lyme,
and his tox screen's clean.

66
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,150
In case you hadn't noticed,
not exactly
in the mood to dance.

67
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm not asking you to dance.
I'm asking you to do your job.

68
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,100
EKG showed arrhythmia.
Probably just
a mild heart attack.

69
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,770
No chest pain.
And smoke inhalation already
explains the arrhythmia.

70
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,140
The guy was in the burn unit
for six months
and had multiple surgeries.

71
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,680
Could be a hospital-acquired
infection. Maybe MRSA.

72
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,650
Works for me.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,580
Draw a blood culture,
start him on antibiotics,

74
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,620
vancomycin plus broad
gram-negative coverage.

75
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,020
If you called to see
the design for my prison tats,
they're still in R and D.

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,890
You need to talk to Tritter.

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,360
Not according to my lawyer.

78
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,430
Your lawyer isn't gonna be
able to get the DA to drop
the case. Tritter can.

79
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,770
Yeah, you know what else
Tritter can do?

80
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,030
You are not impressing anyone!

81
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,440
You may call yourself
principled,

82
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,880
but what you really are
is a stubborn
adolescent idiot!

83
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,740
This isn't his fault!
I'm not the one who...

84
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,180
You used the
rectal thermometer on him.

85
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,840
You insulted him
instead of apologizing.

86
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,580
You flaunted your drug use
in his face and you refused
to accept a deal...

87
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,220
I accepted the deal!

88
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,520
Not until after
you stole a dead guy's pills!

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,690
Allegedly.

90
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,530
Tritter has been opening doors
for you every step of the way

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,860
and you keep
slamming them shut.

92
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,340
There are no more openings
to give, House.

93
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,240
If you wanna stay out of
prison, you got to make
one for yourself.

94
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,470
It's Vicodin.
You function better on it.
Talk to him.

95
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,690
MRSA's a bacteria
that often infects
hospital patients.

96
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,660
The burns on your chest
and arm exposed raw flesh that
made you a wide-open target.

97
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,830
But the antibiotics
would take care of it, right?

98
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,990
Depends on what strain it is.

99
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,500
We'll know more
once we get the results back
from these cultures.

100
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,510
So this MRSA thing,

101
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,910
would it make everything
look blue?

102
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,840
He's seeing blue.

103
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,550
Who'd you get the scrip from?

104
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,350
Cuddy. You wanna know
what I gave her?

105
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,120
MRSA wouldn't change
his ocular palette.

106
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,460
Heavy metal poisoning
could cause vision changes,
particularly thallium.

107
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,430
If it was thallium,
he'd be losing his hair.

108
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,300
So maybe it's menopause.

109
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,530
He's 28 years old.

110
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, his age is the reason
it's weird that a man
has menopause.

111
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,240
Male menopause.
High estrogen,
low testosterone.

112
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,830
Explains the temperature
swings, disorientation,

113
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,680
endocrinologically similar
to female menopause,

114
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,740
but without the vaginas
and the mahjong tiles.

115
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,110
Male menopause doesn't explain
the blue vision.

116
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,880
Blue vision isn't a symptom.
It's a side effect of Viagra.

117
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,180
It's right there on the label,

118
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,990
which I'd had
no reason to have read,
except that I'm a doctor.

119
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,390
He's not taking Viagra.

120
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,690
You mean he didn't tell you
he was taking Viagra.

121
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,060
I don't care how sick he is.
Trust me, he still thinks
he's got a shot.

122
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,590
Menopause causes temperature
swings, limpness,
limpness causes pills,

123
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,730
pills cause the blues.

124
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,900
He's presenting no other signs
of premature aging.

125
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,270
Aging's not the only cause.

126
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,340
You said that he's got
burns on 54% of his body.

127
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,080
Sure it's not 55%?

128
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,410
Burns to his genitals could
cause testicular trauma.

129
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,850
Which could in turn cause...

130
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,920
Run a hormone panel.

131
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,320
When it comes back positive,
pump him full of testosterone
and send him home.

132
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,050
Stop following me!

133
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,700
Thank God my parents are dead.

134
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,260
If the old man had heard
I had menopause,
I'd never live it down.

135
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,000
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

136
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,300
Once these testosterone
pellets dissolve, your system
will be back to normal.

137
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,740
Yeah, but until then
I'm an old lady.

138
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay to come in?

139
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,020
It's not MRSA.
He's not being
isolated anymore.

140
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,450
Anyone not in a white coat
is welcome.

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,490
You're looking better.
How you feeling?

142
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm good.

143
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,720
It turns out I got some
hormone thing.
They're fixing it right now.

144
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,350
(GRUNTS)

145
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,600
Are you okay?

146
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,570
Yeah, I think so, I just...

147
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,500
Derek, are you in pain?

148
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,870
You need to get these out!
Okay, hold on, what's wrong?

149
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,030
DEREK: Get these out!
What's going on?

150
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,670
Looks like
an allergic reaction.

151
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,840
Hold on! We're going to get
you something to stop it.

152
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,070
It's okay.
No, just take them out!

153
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,910
But you've got to calm down.
It's okay.
Get them out!

154
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,470
Derek!
Get them out!

155
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,070
Derek, let her go!

156
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,740
Derek, let her go!

157
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,150
Two milligrams
of IV lorazepam, stat!

158
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,690
Get them out!

159
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,410
The complaint department
is across the hall.

160
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm busy.

161
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,810
Can I just assume
that you told me
how unfair I'm being and...

162
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,220
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,190
You could throw a dart
at all the adjectives between
arrogant and unhinged,

164
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,160
and I'm sure you'd hit one
that describes me.

165
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,100
There's a reason
I operate that way.

166
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,400
I live in pain.

167
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,900
Pain that on good days
is merely intolerable.

168
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,570
And on bad ones
will suck the life force
right out of you.

169
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,780
It doesn't mean that
I've handled this right.

170
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,880
Actually,
it means I was wrong.

171
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,860
Thank you.

172
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,530
I know that couldn't have
been easy for you to say.

173
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,960
Even if you don't mean
a word of it.

174
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,010
Look, you can hook me up
to a damn polygraph...

176
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,050
And I'm sure you'd pass.

177
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,110
The thing is I've
never been interested
in what you have to say.

178
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,820
All I care about
is what you do.

179
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,490
I'll see you at the hearing.

180
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,330
FOREMAN: It wasn't
the medicine.

181
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,100
Contamination
and allergy tests
both came back negative.

182
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,610
There was nothing to suggest
a pulmonary embolism.

183
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,080
And his EKG showed the
expected tachycardia from
the exertion of the attack.

184
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,010
And I'm fine, by the way,
thanks for asking.

185
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,380
Aggression comes on that fast
has got to have
a neurological basis.

186
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,550
We should do a CT for
a frontal lobe tumor
and an LP for meningitis.

187
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,700
Great. Have at it.

188
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,170
That's it?
No challenging our theory,
no tearing us down?

189
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,940
No need.
You got it under control.

190
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,040
Where are you going?

191
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,810
Upstairs this time.

192
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,380
To do what?

193
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,650
Check myself into rehab.

194
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,230
CUDDY: Did Tritter offer you
another deal?

195
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,930
Nope. This is all me.

196
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,040
So, no slaps on the back?
Encouraging words?

197
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,900
We're just trying to
understand what this is.

198
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,600
I hope it's me detoxing,

199
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,580
otherwise I soiled a perfectly
good pair of underwear
last night for nothing.

200
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,840
So this is for real?

201
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,750
It's not just a show
for Tritter?

202
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,790
Absolutely it's
a show for Tritter.
And the judge.

203
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,050
And, unfortunately,
unless it's real,
there is no show.

204
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,890
Hey, if it doesn't
help my case,

205
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,760
at least I can go to prison
with heightened senses.

206
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,490
All the better to enjoy
my strolls around the yard.

207
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,660
Time's up. Group's starting.

208
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,640
Gonna need to
check that stuff.

209
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,500
When I lead
the big patient rebellion,

210
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,770
Voldemort here
is the first to go.

211
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,900
CT was normal,
no frontal lobe tumor,

212
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,680
LP was negative
for meningitis.

213
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,740
We're back to square one.

214
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,650
What about something vascular?
Polyarteritis nodosa?

215
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,310
Brain lesions would have
shown up on the CT.

216
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,360
Legionnaire's explains
the chills and temperature.

217
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,320
Altered mental status
causes the aggression.

218
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,120
We would have seen
respiratory problems.

219
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,790
We're throwing darts.
We need to go to House.

220
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,590
We need to
deal with this ourselves.

221
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,360
He can make the time!
Derek's still his patient.

222
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,200
The man's life as he knows it
could be over.

223
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,110
I think you of all people
would want to
cut him some slack.

224
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,740
We're treating a man who runs
into burning buildings
for perfect strangers.

225
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,750
He didn't ask for what's
happening to him. House did
everything to himself.

226
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,280
He's been cut more
than enough slack.

227
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,790
Right now, House has more
important things to deal with.

228
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,880
WOMAN: It was the first time
I'd seen him in months.

229
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,620
I guess I was hoping he'd
put his arms around me
and tell me he understood.

230
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,020
But he said he wasn't
ready to forgive me.

231
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,730
Well, he may never be ready.

232
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,240
You're doing the only thing
you can do. You're trying.

233
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,360
How about you, Greg?

234
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,070
Have you thought about how to
fix things with people
in your life?

235
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,580
No need.

236
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,840
The people in my life
have no expectations of me.

237
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,580
Makes all our lives easier.

238
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,840
Apparently not.

239
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,450
The first step in recovery...

240
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,820
Is admitting I have a problem.

241
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,120
I've obviously done that
or I wouldn't be here.

242
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,920
I've even embraced step two
and accepted that
there is a higher power.

243
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,800
Maybe not a god per se,
but that André the Giant guy
was powerful.

244
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,290
Where I start to butt up
against it is step three,

245
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,070
surrendering my will
to this higher power.

246
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,580
I'm sure André's ghost
has my back and all,
but my free will,

247
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,200
I never leave home without it.

248
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,270
Kind of like your pills.

249
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,440
If you could do this
on your own,
I assume you wouldn't be here.

250
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,350
True.

251
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,770
Everybody lies.
His tox screen.

252
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,170
It's been clean every time.

253
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,100
Exactly. It shouldn't be.

254
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,570
He's had extensive
skin grafts,
which hurt like hell.

255
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,170
Not everybody's House.
People can handle pain
without medication.

256
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,680
But they do have pain.

257
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,740
This guy's worried about
losing his job,
so he's hiding the pain.

258
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,880
We find out where the pain is,
maybe we find out
what the problem is.

259
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,440
Or he doesn't feel pain.

260
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,390
Either way, it's something.

261
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,250
(PAGERS BEEPING)

262
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,460
When?
Two minutes ago.

263
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,470
Pulse is 157, respiration 42.

264
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,160
He was fine.
He was just telling me a joke,

265
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,900
just a minute ago...
Get her out of here!

266
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,630
No fluid in his lungs!

267
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,200
O2 stat's 85. He's hypoxic!
We're gonna have to intubate!

268
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,370
It's not his lungs!
He's got marked ST elevation.

269
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,540
He's having a heart attack.

270
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,080
Pick a color.

271
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,850
Medication time.

272
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,090
"You are a ray of sunshine
on a cloudy day."

273
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,470
He's stable.

274
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,710
Won't stay that way.

275
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,750
His blood tests showed
troponins and CK-MB up.

276
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,790
Chase was right.
He was hiding chest pain.

277
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,020
He's been having
a whole series
of heart attacks.

278
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,990
Heart attacks can't cause you
to reach out
and choke someone.

279
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,220
Lack of oxygen to the brain
causes disorientation.

280
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,850
Increased adrenaline
causes rage.

281
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,370
The more important question is
what caused the attacks?

282
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,070
Where are you going?
To see House.

283
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,910
We have a 28-year-old
with clean arteries,
no valvular abnormalities

284
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,000
having multiple heart attacks.

285
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,010
I'm not gonna wait
for Chase to give us
another breakthrough.

286
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,420
Maybe we should go.

287
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,890
We don't have an answer yet.

288
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,390
I'm fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking!

289
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,730
Whoever came up with
buprenorphine to wean off
Vicodin should be shot.

290
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,730
Then stabbed in the eye.

291
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,100
I think someone
needs to adjust my meds!

292
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,900
The heart shows no signs
of inflammation or...

293
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,800
If the cause of the
heart attacks isn't internal,
it must be external.

294
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,970
Something environmental.

295
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,510
None of the attacks happened
in the same place.

296
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,870
Still must be something
in common.

297
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,670
First one happened
in an apartment building fire.

298
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,480
Fire, water, smoke,
oxygen masks...

299
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,180
The second and third ones
happened here.

300
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,510
There was no fire,
no water, no smoke.

301
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,780
His clothes
were all different,
he'd been cleaned.

302
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,620
That's the "whats".
How about the "whos"?

303
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,560
His partner Amy was
at all three attacks, but...

304
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,850
Anyone else?

305
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,860
People don't
cause heart attacks.

306
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,990
Well, then you shouldn't
be worried about
proving me wrong.

307
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,770
Amy? Would you come with me,
please?

308
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,740
Anything new on my brother?

309
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,280
We're not quite sure yet.
Could you come with me?

310
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,540
Yeah.

311
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,890
What's this all about?

312
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,490
I don't know.

313
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,560
They wanted to
talk to us together.

314
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,200
Derek!

315
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,870
House was right.

316
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,980
AMY: I don't get it.

317
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,350
How can I be causing
his heart attacks?

318
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,650
You may be carrying an agent
that triggered them.

319
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,780
It could be anything,
mold spores,
poisonous plant residue,

320
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,830
something you picked up
at a fire site.

321
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,560
Until we identify the agent,
we can't allow you near Derek.

322
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,400
I can't believe that
I'm doing this to him.

323
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,800
You can't blame yourself
for this.

324
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,930
You know how he got
those skin grafts?

325
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,940
He was trapped in a fire.

326
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,510
We were clearing rooms
in an office building fire.

327
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,710
And the ceiling collapsed,
and it cut me off
from the rest of the group.

328
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,580
And I kept yelling
that I was fine,

329
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,150
but Derek refused
to wait for the team
to clear the debris,

330
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,590
so he took off looking for
another access point.

331
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,390
He got caught in a backdraft.

332
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,140
He almost died
because of me once.

333
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
And now it's happening again.

334
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,830
You're not my mom.
You don't have to
keep checking up on me.

335
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,000
How you doing?

336
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,540
Not bad,

337
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,440
considering I've just learned
I'm completely powerless.

338
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,500
See this big fancy wing?

339
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,510
It was built because
this program works.

340
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,880
Faulty logic.

341
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,150
This big fancy wing exists
because some people with money
think that it works,

342
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,190
wanna believe that
they can buy a better world.

343
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,950
This is nothing short of
idealized despair.
Let other people wallow in it.

344
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,960
I don't even know
what that means.

345
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,220
None of this means anything.

346
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,770
It's just nonsensical slogans
and platitudes.

347
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,300
Meaning takes time,
it takes work.

348
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,390
What do you think
I've been doing?

349
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,030
You've been here for two days!
Talk about wallowing in it!

350
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,670
We all get it.
We know how much pain
you have.

351
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,110
You're here to deal with that
and get on with your life!

352
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,670
Right! I should have an affair
with a dying patient
and move into a hotel.

353
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,490
You're a coward, House.

354
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,520
You find fault in everybody
because you're afraid
to look at yourself.

355
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,060
Thanks. I was running short
on platitudes.
You can leave now.

356
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,140
We tested Amy for about
a dozen different agents, but
they all came back negative.

357
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,680
So she's not causing
the attacks.

358
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,180
Derek, are you
in love with her?

359
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,320
What does that have to do
with anything?

360
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,820
Amy told me how
you got those skin grafts.

361
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,160
And the way you're always
watching out for her, and I
see the way you look at her.

362
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,860
Have you told her
how you feel?

363
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,070
She has a six-year-old
daughter.

364
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,080
Women with daughters
can still fall in love.

365
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,670
I know.

366
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,010
Because she did.
With my brother.

367
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,710
They're engaged.

368
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,420
Broken heart syndrome.
He's in love
and it's killing him.

369
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,620
I thought that only happened
to 80-year-old widows.

370
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,690
Thanks to his menopause
and estrogen level,
he basically is an old woman.

371
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,130
BHS is an acute physical
response to
an emotional experience.

372
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,260
Stress triggers
a flood of catecholamines...

373
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,780
That's a plain old stress
cardiomyopathy,
not a heart attack.

374
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,140
But if you're too worried
about losing your job
to get it treated,

375
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,580
they can devolve
into full-on heart attacks.

376
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,280
You think it's
a coincidence this started
when Amy got engaged?

377
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,150
No, I don't.

378
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,810
But now that you
know the "why",

379
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,410
what are you gonna do
to stop the "how"?

380
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,420
I already put him
on beta-blockers
and nitroglycerin. No effect.

381
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,980
We need to put him
on antidepressants.

382
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,460
Not if you're right.

383
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,860
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

384
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,660
which would only speed up
the heart attacks.

385
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,170
We could try propylthiouracil,
slow down his metabolic rate.

386
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,830
Thyroid effect would
only weaken the heart.

387
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,960
The only other option
is blood thinners.

388
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,640
This is not a fat guy
with plaque-filled arteries
and a swollen heart.

389
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,800
He's a guy whose brain
is trying to kill his heart.

390
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,780
So buy him a girlfriend,
make him happy.

391
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,410
That might make you happy.

392
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,450
The only thing that'll
make him happy is Amy.

393
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,180
So keep him away from her.

394
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,660
He has a myocardial infarction
every time she walks
in the room.

395
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,750
What do you think will happen
to his heart

396
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,020
when we tell him
he can never see her again?

397
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,650
CHASE: He needs a shrink.

398
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,720
Chase's idea
is as good as any.

399
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,670
But short of frying his brain
and wiping Amy out,
he's screwed.

400
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,710
We need Cuddy.

401
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,830
Why?

402
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,000
So you can tell her
why you need to
fry a guy's brain.

403
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,140
The guy's heart isn't working
and you want to
shock his brain.

404
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,280
Electroshock therapy is
the only way to erase
his memories of Amy

405
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,250
and stop the brain's
chemical attack on the heart.

406
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,880
This isn't 1940!

407
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,050
The problem can be controlled
with antidepressants.

408
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,110
Cameron?

409
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,490
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

410
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,790
speed up the attacks.

411
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,430
LMNO, PTU, blood thinners,
none of them
will solve this problem.

412
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,730
The man's got a real-life
Harlequin Romance in his head.

413
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,600
We're gonna pull out
the 1940 playbook.

414
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,080
Bilateral electrodes,
high-stimulus
sine-wave intensity,

415
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,380
turning that dial
all the way to 11.

416
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,510
It's basic brain chemistry.

417
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,380
We interrupt
protein synthesis, altering
the neurotransmitter system.

418
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,790
End result, no memories,
no Amy, no problem.

419
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,130
Go ahead.

420
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,690
You heard the lady,
go plug him in.

421
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,630
Am I really that pathetic?

422
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,270
What are you talking about?

423
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,710
If I had pitched
electroshock therapy

424
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,380
as a cure for
broken heart syndrome
any other time,

425
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,150
you'd have dug in,
made me try a hundred other
useless things first.

426
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,460
So either you're actually
beginning to trust me

427
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,590
or you just feel sorry for me.

428
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,530
You presented
a reasonable argument.

429
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,470
You were clear-headed
and non-impulsive about it.

430
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,010
Never once
used the word "moron."

431
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,940
The rehab's working, House.

432
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,810
CAMERON: You'll still be
able to perform
routine functions

433
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,510
like walking, talking,
tying your shoes.

434
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,780
The treatment targets
the anterior cingulated
cortex.

435
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,260
It should only affect
your experiential memories.

436
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,350
So my parents? My childhood?

437
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,490
If this works,
you won't remember them.

438
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,690
Or your firefighting training.

439
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,670
And Amy.

440
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,610
Are you okay with that?

441
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,270
I wouldn't miss her, right?

442
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,680
Tell Amy how you feel.
Because if she loves you...

443
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:00,050
No. I won't do that to her.
Or to my brother.

444
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,350
You're effectively
killing who you are
just to keep this secret.

445
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,730
She doesn't love me.

446
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,000
(DOOR OPENING)

447
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,050
Caterpillar?

448
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,450
Lower intestine
with ulcerative colitis.

449
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,790
You crash art therapy classes
just for the adrenaline rush?

450
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,630
Cuddy wouldn't get off
the phone until I promised
I'd come and see for myself.

451
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,000
I got to admit,
this move I did not expect.

452
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,970
Well, don't tell anyone,
but the photos of smiling
people in the brochures,

453
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,770
it's just marketing.

454
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,380
Well, you're obviously
making an effort.

455
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,450
So I suppose the next step is
for me to talk to the DA.

456
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Which you have
no intention of doing.

457
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,520
No.

458
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,920
So words mean nothing,
actions mean nothing,
what the hell is left?

459
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,370
You son of a bitch!

460
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,600
What about your words,
your actions?

461
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,840
"Got to get House cleaned up.
Got to get him
to show some humility."

462
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,140
But when it comes to actually
doing something,

463
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,740
you prove that all you
care about is
bitch-slapping a guy

464
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,980
who refused to kiss your ass!

465
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,050
You ever trust an addict?

466
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,930
You ever give one
the benefit of the doubt?

467
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,020
How many times
did that work out for you...

468
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah, I get it.

469
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,430
And so you were screwed over
by your wife, your mother,
your partner.

470
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,100
But you keep sending them
Christmas cards while you
take it out on everyone else!

471
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,140
No more Christmas cards.

472
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,700
No, I learned.

473
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,710
People like you,
even your actions lie.

474
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,290
I'm scared.

475
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,590
I know.

476
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,930
I'm gonna give you
a muscle relaxant so your body
doesn't convulse.

477
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,060
Count backwards from 10.

478
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,110
Ten, nine, eight,

479
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,580
seven...

480
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,290
Go.

481
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,180
CAMERON: What's your name?
Derek.

482
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,450
FOREMAN: Heart sounds good.

483
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,960
CAMERON: Do you know what city
we're in?

484
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,920
No.

485
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,190
Would you be okay with
a couple of visitors?

486
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,850
Derek, it's me. Brock.

487
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,660
I'm your brother,
and when you get out of here,
you'll be staying with me.

488
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,440
I'm Amy.

489
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,970
I'm your friend.

490
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,580
I'm sorry,
but I don't remember
either of you.

491
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,020
CAMERON: We've given him
four rounds of electroshock.

492
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,700
The charge made his voice
a little higher, but the EKG
and BP are good.

493
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,900
Good.

494
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,100
We're gonna give him
his last round in the morning,

495
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,140
then be in court
for your hearing.

496
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,410
Thanks.

497
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,780
I'm gonna stay here.
Monitor Derek.

498
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,750
Thanks for the update.

499
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,520
My next condolence call
is arriving.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

500
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,200
I got you something.

501
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,070
Nice.

502
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,550
I figured it might help make
a good impression
on the judge.

503
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,380
It's not that nice.

504
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,520
I had no business blaming you
for any of this.

505
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,520
I know you were just
trying to help me. Protect me.

506
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,560
That's what friends do.

507
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,270
Is this an apology?

508
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,780
Part of the program.

509
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,080
If you don't like it,
I can stop.
Not at all.

510
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,610
It's just so

511
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,610
unfamiliar.

512
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,240
Please, keep going.

513
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,100
He looks lost.

514
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,770
It's gonna take him a while.

515
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,540
Brock's pulling
a double shift.

516
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,410
He can't stand to
see him this way.

517
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,590
Derek's gonna need him, Amy.

518
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,110
I know the timing isn't great
with a wedding coming up.

519
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,050
What wedding?

520
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,360
Yours. You and Brock.

521
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,390
We're not getting married.
We don't even date.

522
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,630
Why would you think
we're getting married?

523
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,640
When you first offered
Dr. House the chance
to check into drug rehab,

524
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,940
how did he respond?

525
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,540
He told me to
get out of his office.

526
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,510
I warned him that he could
end up in prison
and lose his medical license.

527
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,980
If he was concerned,
he didn't show it.

528
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,850
So you continued
your investigation?

529
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,980
Yes.

530
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,920
Which is what led me
to the hospital pharmacy.

531
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,720
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

532
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,350
Turn it off.
What did you
tell the pharmacist

533
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,520
was the reason
for your visit?

534
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,070
I thought I told you
never to call me
when I'm on trial.

535
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,800
The memories were false.
We fried his brain
for nothing.

536
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,630
Whatever was killing him
before is still there.

537
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,730
We did an MRI.

538
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,270
<i>There's slight hypo-perfusion</i>
<i>in the anterior cortex.</i>

539
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,640
What did you find
when you checked
the pharmacy log?

540
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,540
Hold on, Mr. Vickers.

541
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,550
Thanks, Your Honor.
It's hard to hear.

542
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,880
Did you test for clotting time
and LV function?

543
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,010
I believe that this is
a medical emergency,
Your Honor.

544
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,520
His blood's normal
and his heart's pumping it
up to the brain.

545
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,990
But it's not all
getting there.

546
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,420
Something's obstructing
the blood flow...

547
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,290
Dr. House, you were given
adequate notice

548
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,880
to make arrangements
for your patients.

549
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,930
There's no hyper intensity
to suggest a foreign body
near the region.

550
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,070
<i>And no signs of infection</i>
<i>or vascular malformations.</i>

551
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,290
It's lower down.

552
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,600
Dr. House, hang up!

553
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,500
<i>CAMERON.:</i>
<i>The cytology on the LP</i>
<i>doesn't suggest a tumor.</i>

554
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,660
Now!

555
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,570
Hang on a second.

556
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,200
Does your voice always
get that high and annoying
when you're angry?

557
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,910
Do you want to go to jail?

558
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,280
No, thank you.

559
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,110
Set him up for a selective
vertebral angiography.
I'm on my way.

560
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,850
Dr. House.

561
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,290
House! Sit down!

562
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,190
Why? I'm bored.

563
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,420
There's nothing I can say
or do that's gonna
make a difference here.

564
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,800
If you leave this room,
I will find you in contempt.

565
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,660
Get a recess.

566
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,130
Are you out of your mind?

567
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,870
They said they wanted
me there, but I don't think
they like me.

568
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,140
His voice isn't high because
of the electrical charges.

569
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,700
It's another symptom
of menopause.

570
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,440
His system keeps getting hit
by women's issues,

571
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,310
so let's follow the pattern.

572
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,320
What might obstruct the blood
flow that's more common
in women than men?

573
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,150
Is the catheter in?
CHASE: Go back to court.

574
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,480
We'll let you know
the results.

575
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,390
Shut up and wire him.

576
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,260
Center the image
on the interpeduncular
cistern.

577
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,260
Keep it moving at
30 frames per second.

578
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,100
If you think the arteries
are narrowing,
you're gonna need still shots,

579
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,500
which we can do without you.

580
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,330
The problem is not
how wide the road is.

581
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,860
There's a guy with a squeegee
on the sidewalk flagging cars.

582
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,380
That's what's causing
the slowdown.

583
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,210
We find him,
we find the problem.

584
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,110
He's wired.
Go!

585
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,880
Injecting the dye.

586
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,310
Blood's in the capillaries.

587
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,090
There.

588
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,120
Mr. Squeegee.

589
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,320
Spinal meningioma
pushing on the nerves
to the vocal cords

590
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,060
creates the voice change.

591
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,190
And that nerve just happens
to live right near
the meningeal branch

592
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,470
of the vertebral artery,
obstructs the blood flow
to the brain.

593
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,370
The brain malfunctions,
creating false memories.

594
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,480
Memories cause love.
Love kills.

595
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,680
And we didn't completely
screw up.

596
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,620
Cleaning the slate
bought us time to
find the real problem.

597
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,420
On the other hand,
if we had been better,

598
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,320
we wouldn't have
needed the time.

599
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,480
Schedule him for surgery.
Dig that thing out.

600
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,050
He can start enjoying
real misery instead of
the fake stuff.

601
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,060
House.

602
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,840
I just heard that you
apologized to Wilson.

603
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,730
Detoxing. I didn't know
what I was saying.

604
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,720
Excuse me.

605
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,020
I have to go to jail.

606
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,220
What is your position at
Princeton-Plainsboro?

607
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,290
Chief Administrator
and Dean of Medicine.

608
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,420
And you're responsible
for oversight of the pharmacy?

609
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,690
Yes.

610
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,200
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt.

611
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,170
I hope you don't mind
that we continued on
without you?

612
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,510
I said I was sorry.
There's no need
to be sarcastic.

613
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,510
What is this?

614
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,020
That's our
prescription sign-out log
from December 24th.

615
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,420
Does that appear to be
Dr. House's signature?

616
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,580
Yes.

617
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,990
What has he signed for?

618
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,360
A prescription for oxycodone
in the name of patient
Larry Zebalusky.

619
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,360
And did those pills
ever reach that patient?

620
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,560
No.
Why?

621
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,930
He was already dead.

622
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,730
And Dr. House knew this?

623
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,830
Yes.

624
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,770
So, Dr. House had no legal
or medical basis for acquiring
that oxycodone?

625
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,940
Dr. Cuddy?

626
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,480
He never got the pills.

627
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,110
It's his signature.
The log is strictly
controlled.

628
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,390
Dr. House did pick up
a prescription,
but it wasn't for oxycodone.

629
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,290
It says oxycodone.
You testified...

630
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,990
I know,
but it wasn't oxycodone.

631
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Dr. Wilson informed me
that Dr. House
already tried to steal

632
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,500
the pain medication
of this patient,
which made clear to me

633
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,940
that Dr. House was in
a particularly vulnerable
and desperate state.

634
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,010
So I went to the pharmacy
and I swapped bottles.

635
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,550
Dr. House only got
a bottle with placebos.

636
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,350
I understand your impulse
to protect
a valued colleague...

637
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,150
I have it right here
on the inventory report...

638
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,060
Your Honor, she's lying!
She's obviously forged
that report.

639
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,220
In light of this evidence...

640
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,420
If this is real,
why didn't she
mention it earlier?

641
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,090
I move to dismiss this case!

642
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,530
There is other evidence,
Your Honor!

643
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,090
Everyone shut up and sit down.

644
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,470
Dr. Cuddy, why are you
only now coming forward
with this?

645
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,440
I guess I never expected it
to go this far.

646
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,110
The witness is excused.

647
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,880
Your Honor,
you can't seriously believe...

648
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,350
Dr. House, please stand.

649
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,620
My suspicion is your boss...

650
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,700
My suspicion is
you have better friends
than you deserve.

651
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,000
Rules and laws
apply to everyone.

652
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,900
You are not as special
as you think.

653
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,940
But Detective Tritter
chose to make you so.

654
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,210
Detective, I don't know
exactly what's going on here,

655
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,050
but I am sure that this man
is not flooding the streets
with cocaine.

656
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,810
I'm also certain that,
knowing Dr. House,

657
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,680
he must have done something
to set you off.

658
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,660
But you're gonna have to
live with it.

659
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,660
Given Dr. Cuddy's testimony,
I'm not going to allow this
to proceed to jury.

660
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,220
Case dismissed.
Court is adjourned.

661
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,910
Dr. House, you're still guilty
of contempt for that
little walkout earlier.

662
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,370
You'll be spending
the night in jail,

663
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,840
and after that you're
going right back
to your rehab.

664
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,670
Bailiff, take Dr. House
into custody.

665
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,050
Dr. House.

666
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,130
So should I be looking for you
in the shadows,

667
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,040
or flinch every time
a car backfires?

668
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,640
Good luck.

669
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,270
I hope I'm wrong about you.

670
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,320
CAMERON: They got
the meningioma.

671
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,230
Your brain should
start generating
real memories again.

672
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,360
What do I do when I get out?

673
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,330
You have people who love you.
They'll take care of you.

674
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,600
You start over.

675
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,150
CUDDY: I'm surprised to see
you're not spooning your way
through the walls.

676
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,290
So, what do you say?
How about a conjugal
visit to celebrate?

677
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,490
There's nothing to celebrate,
House! You made me
perjure myself.

678
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,160
Fabricate evidence.

679
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,860
You make everyone around you
worse for being there.

680
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,470
The only bright spot is that
now I own your ass.

681
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,500
When you get out of rehab,
you're gonna be
pulling double clinic duty,

682
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,480
giving lectures to students,
helping me find donors,

683
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,350
pretty much anything else
I ask. You got it?

684
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,330
Your buprenorphine.

685
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,970
You get these from
the pharmacy
or from Voldemort?

686
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,170
Voldemort. Why?
What difference does it...

687
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,920
That's Vicodin.
He's been slipping
you Vicodin?

688
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,820
No! He'd be risking his
minimum-wage job to do that.

689
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,170
The whole time?

690
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,900
My higher power said
it was okay.

691
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,770
Nothing's changed?

692
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,670
Nothing's changed.

693
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,210
The apology.

694
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,460
You didn't need to do that
to make this work.

695
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,460
Believe what you want.

696
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,660
Good night, House.

697
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,100
I'll see you tomorrow.

698
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,530
Good night, Wilson.

699
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,470
