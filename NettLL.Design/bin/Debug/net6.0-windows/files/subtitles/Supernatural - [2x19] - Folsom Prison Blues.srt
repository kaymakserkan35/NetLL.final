1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,300
Dad wants us to pick
up where he left off

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,100
Saving people, hunting things...

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,300
The family business.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,800
You were the bank robber
on the 11:00 news, not me.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,100
Yeah. This is special
gent Victor Hendrickson.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,800
It's my job to bring you in
alive's a bonus but not necessary.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,500
I've been looking for you for weeks now.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,100
And, yes, I know about sam, too.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,500
I know about the murder in st. Louis,
the houdini act you pulled in baltimore.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,100
I know about the
desecrations and the thefts.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,400
I know about your dad.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,700
You don't know crap about my dad.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,300
We are so screwed.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,600
So, this makes a lot of sense.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,600
First, they close down this cellblock,
and now they open it back up again.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,700
There's your tax dollars at work.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
You got that ready?

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,700
Yes

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,600
Would hate to have
gotten thrown in here.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Hey, you feel that, man?

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,400
Who is that?

22
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,800
Hey!

23
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
Hey, guard! Hey!

24
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,700
Come on, man!

25
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,600
Hey! Guard!

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,700
Come here! Hey!

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Going down to "b" block.
Randall again. Copy that.

28
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Hey! Guard, hey! Shut up

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,100
Come on, randall, I'm trying to sleep.
You're telling me you didn't see that?

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,300
Are you blind?Hey!

31
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,400
Randall, cool it.
"Cool it," my ass, man.

32
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,700
There's somebody out there. Randall,
turn out your light and go to sleep.

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm not gonna say it again.

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,300
Lights out, "b" block.
Copy that. Lights out

35
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,900
No.

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No! No!No! No!

37
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Help!

38
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,500
No! No! No!

39
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,600
No! No! Nooo!Aah! Nooooo!

40
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,900
This way.

41
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,400
I hate this plan, dean. Yeah, I got
that the first 10 times I heard it.

42
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,800
Freeze!

43
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,100
I said, "freeze"!

44
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,900
Put your hands behind your
head! Get down on your knees.

45
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
Now!

46
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,100
To the front.

47
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,500
To the right.

48
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
I call this one the blue steel.

49
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Yeah, that's right.

50
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,100
Okay, back to the line up.

51
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,000
Wait, who looks better,
me or nick nolte? Shut up.

52
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,900
Well, it's about time.I'll
have a cheeseburger.

53
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,800
Extra onions.

54
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
You think yo're fine.
I think I'm adorable.

55
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,600
It is a pleasure to finally
meet you in person, dean.

56
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm special agent Victor Hendrickson.
This is my partner special agent Reidy.

57
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,100
Hendrickson.

58
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,400
Not the milwaukee agent
Hendrickson. Live and in person.

59
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
Oh, nice shot.

60
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,100
You can hang that up in
your cell at supermax.

61
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,900
Maybe we can just forget
the cheeseburgers, huh?

62
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, yeah. Keep that game face on.

63
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,300
Try and cover up how cornered you are.

64
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,200
Read him the charges.

65
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,800
You got mail fraud, credit
card fraud. Grave desecration.

66
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,600
Skip to the good ones.

67
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,200
Armed robbery, kidnapping, and, oh,

68
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,100
Three counts of first degree murder.

69
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,000
And after milwaukee, your brother is
now a suspect in a murder case himself.

70
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,400
I'd say, for you two

71
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
"Screwed to hell" is
a major understatement.

72
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,700
Well, where there's
life, there's hope, huh?

73
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Aw. See, that's what I kept thinking as I was
searching for your asses all over hell and gone.

74
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,100
Your dad taught you well.

75
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,500
The way you cover your tracks,
and, after milwaukee, the way you

76
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,600
...Vanished.

77
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Near went nuts trying
to find you. Ask him.

78
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,800
He near went nuts.

79
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,500
And after all of that, you get
tripped upon a motion detector.

80
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,300
Pretty rookie move.
I got to say, I was...

81
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,200
Surprised.

82
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
Dean winchester? In the flesh.

83
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,300
And you are? Mara daniels
public defender's office.

84
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,600
I've been assigned you
and your brother's case.

85
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,800
Are you hendrickson? Yeah,
and we're not quite done here.

86
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,800
Uh, yeah, you are, and
if you don't mind...

87
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,300
I would like to meet
with my clients privately.

88
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,500
Unfortunately, your arraignment
on the breaking and entering charge

89
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,700
Won't be until tuesday.

90
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
They'll keep us in
county jail? That's right.

91
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,700
Green river county detention center? Yes

92
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,100
And considering the
charges you're facing,

93
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,000
No judge in his right mind
is going to grant you bail.

94
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,800
Yeah, we figured that.

95
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,100
Extradition papers have already
been filed from five separate states,

96
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Missouri and wisconsin being the biggest
concern the bank robbery and the murder raps.

97
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,900
How long can we stall extradition?

98
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,600
A week. Maybe less.

99
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,600
All right.Let's go.

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Don't worry, sam. I promise
I won't trade you for smokes.

101
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,400
I call top bunk.

102
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,400
Okay.

103
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,600
My roommate doesn't
say much. How's yours?

104
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Just keeps staring at me...

105
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,100
In a way that makes me really uneasy.

106
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,900
Sounds like you're making
new friends. Dean...

107
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,400
This is, without a doubt, the
dumbest, craziest thing we've ever done

108
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,200
And that's in a long, storied
career of dumb and crazy.

109
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,700
Calm down. It's all part
of the plan. Oh, really?

110
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,100
Hendrickson showing up
was part of the plan?

111
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah, that guy moves a
little faster than I thought.

112
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,711
All we got to do is find this ghost

113
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:19,081
Put the sucker down, then grab ourselves
a couple of those tear drop tattoos.

114
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:20,300
That's not funny.

115
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,200
Dean, what about this escape plan?

116
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,200
It's a sure thing. I wouldn't
have gone in if it wasn'T.

117
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,200
I mean, come on, man.This place
has all the signs of a haunting.

118
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,000
Innocent people are dead four
so far. Oh, yeah. Innocent.

119
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
What, are you from
texas all of a sudden?

120
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,300
Just 'cause these people are in
jail doesn't mean they deserve to die

121
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,200
And if we don't stop this thing,
people are gonna continue to die.

122
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,800
We do the job wherever
it takes us. Look, dean.

123
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Just be straight with me, all right?

124
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,000
You're doing this for
deacon? Damn right.

125
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,000
But we barely even know the guy.

126
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,300
We know he was in the corps with dad. We
know he saved dad's life. We know we owe him.

127
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
Yeah, all right. But don't you
think he's asking a little much?

128
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
Doesn't matter.

129
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,700
We may not be saints, but we're
loyal, and we pay our debts.

130
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Now, that means something to
me, and it ought to to you.

131
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm not thrilled about this either, man,

132
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,800
But deacon asked upto
hunt this thing down.

133
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

134
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,500
You know, this chicken isn't
half bad. Great. Finish mine.

135
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,500
All right, so let's go backover this, dean.
Spirit suspect number oneis mark moody, right?

136
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,300
Yeah, psycho killer extraordinaire

137
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Satanism, ritual murderer, died in jail.

138
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
You sure it's him? Pretty sure.

139
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,800
Dean, considering our circumstances,
I'm gonna need better than "pretty sure."

140
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,600
Really pretty sure.

141
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,100
Moody diedof a heart attack, which is
what all the victims in here are dying of.

142
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,800
He died in the old cell block,which they
closed after he croaked, 30 years ago.

143
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,500
They just opened that back up.
That's when the killings started.

144
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,100
So you think his spirit
was released somehow?

145
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,100
But what if he was already cremated?

146
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,500
I'm guessing there's something in the
old block that's keeping him around.

147
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,200
And what ever it is, we got to find it.
And, uh, you know the rest. I'm done.

148
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,200
Sorry. I watch where you're going.

149
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Yeah. Sure.I just

150
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
He said he was sorry. Dean...

151
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,800
You talking to me?

152
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,300
Are you talking to me?

153
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Great, another guy who's seen"taxi driver"
too many times. Yeah, I'm talking to you.

154
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,600
Trust me.Let it go.

155
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,000
Dean, come on.

156
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,600
See, that's how you got
to talk to these guys.

157
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,900
Instant respect.

158
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,200
You were saying?

159
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,700
Oh, great.

160
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,200
That's enough!

161
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,700
On your feet, lucas.

162
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,300
Yes, sir, boss.

163
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,600
What's your name? Winchester.

164
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,500
Well, winchester... not a good start.

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Solitary.

166
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,500
You too, lucas. Yes,sir.

167
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,600
Are we having fun yet,huh?

168
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,500
I wish I had a baseball.

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,600
What? What'd you say?

170
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,800
I said, "I wish I had a baseball."

171
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,300
You know, like like steve mcqueen. Yeah?

172
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,300
Well, I wish I had a bat so I
could bash your fricking head in.

173
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
Okay.

174
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,300
Well, so much for the
bonding in solitary moment.

175
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,200
Crap.

176
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Lucas, listen to me.Stay very still.

177
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,400
Hendrick--
Hey, daniels.

178
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,300
Can I have a word? Have a seat.

179
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
What's on your mind? I've been
going through the winchester charges

180
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,948
And I got to say

181
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:52,008
There are some weird in
consistencies. Welcome to my world.

182
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:55,600
I talked to a cop in baltimore
who swears up and down

183
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,700
These boys saved her life
and helped her catch a killer.

184
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,000
And there's a witness to your bank robbery in
milwaukee. She swears sam and dean saved her life.

185
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,900
Saved her from what? She
was a little unclear on that.

186
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,100
That's because she's nuts.

187
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Look, I was in milwaukee. I spoke
to her. I spoke to all the witnesses.

188
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,600
And? And

189
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,200
All I know is,wherever
these guys go, people die.

190
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
It's that simple. I
don't know that it is.

191
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,700
They just don't seem
cut and dry guilty to me.

192
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,500
I think there's more to this. Like what?

193
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,200
I don't know.

194
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,700
Can't put my finger on it.

195
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,500
It's just...

196
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,800
Strange. Strange.

197
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,800
Yeah. Okay.

198
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,400
Grown ups are trying to get
some work done here, so...

199
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,600
If you don't mind...

200
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,200
How you doing?

201
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,084
I'm 54 years old, mopping the floor
of a crapper with bars on the windows.

202
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:14,332
How you think I'm doing?

203
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,300
All right. Bad icebreaker.

204
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm sam. Randall.

205
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,200
Nice to meet you.Randall.

206
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,200
Hey, weren't you there the
night that guard died? Yeah.

207
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
Well, what happened?

208
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,600
They say the stress of
the job got him. Yeah?

209
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What do you say?

210
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,700
Why are you inside, kid?

211
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,900
'Cause I got an idiot for a brother.

212
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,700
That'll do it. Yeah.

213
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,100
Well, this place ain't so bad. Compared to
the old cellblock, this is the damn hilton.

214
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,000
You spent time in the old block?
Oh, yeah, I was a regular customer.

215
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,300
Didn't they have mark moody
there for a while? He was there.

216
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,100
I was there, too, the night
that lunatic bought it.

217
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,500
Yeah? It was a heart attack, right?

218
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,500
Sure, his heart stopped right after the guard
stopped using his head for batting practice.

219
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,100
The next morning, I was in his cell,
mopping up the blood. What a mess.

220
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,100
Wait. So he  he was beaten
and nobody reported it?

221
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,700
You kept your mouth shut, unless you wanted
to die from the same heart attack, you know?

222
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,300
Randall, exactly how
much blood was there?

223
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,900
Call. Three aces.

224
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,800
That's a bad beat.

225
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,100
That is a bad beat,
but, see, I'm full...

226
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,300
3s over aces.

227
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,700
Sorry. Hey, it's a
cruel game, my friend.

228
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,700
Sorry, guys.

229
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,900
It's like picking low hanging
fruit. You don't even smoke.

230
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
This is the currency of the realm.

231
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,800
Look. I got a good
lead on moody. Me too.

232
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,400
His spirit paid a little
visit last night. What?

233
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,500
The clock stopped, the flickering lights, cold
spot  I mean, he did everything but yell boo.

234
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
Well, what happened?
He walked right by me.

235
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,300
Lucas wasn't so lucky. I mean,
the way he was screaming...

236
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,800
Guy was a jerk, but he didn't
deserve to go like that.

237
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,852
What'd you find out on moody?

238
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:42,505
Yeah, I think I know where
we might find his remains

239
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,400
Blood in his old cell. The blood?
I thought it was a heart attack.

240
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,100
It was, after the
guards worked him over.

241
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
I mean, there was so much bloodin
there, they had trouble mopping it out.

242
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,100
How we gonna get in? I got a plan.

243
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,200
That's the sammy I know.You're like clint
eastwood from "escape from alcatraz."

244
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
The problem is if even if we do find
something, how are we gonna burn it?

245
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,100
We don't have any accelerant.

246
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,500
Good thing I'm like james
garner from "the great escape."

247
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,700
Hey, fellas! Who's ready to deal?

248
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,800
You sure about this? Pretty sure.

249
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,100
Yeah, well, considering our circumstances,
I'd like a little better than "pretty sure."

250
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Okay really pretty sure.

251
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,400
I'd like mine al dente.

252
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,900
Perfect.

253
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,000
Save room for dessert,tiny.

254
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,300
Hey, I wanted to ask you, 'cause I couldn't
help but notice that you are two tons of fun.

255
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,500
Just curious  is it like a thyroid problem,or
is it some deep seated self-Esteem issue?

256
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,800
'Cause, you know, they're,
uh they're just dough nuts.

257
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,400
They're not love.

258
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,300
Guys, give me a hand.

259
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
If we'd waited any longer,you'd be dead.

260
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,300
You waited long enough.

261
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,400
Do yourself a favor.Don't talk.

262
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,800
Take them both up to the infirmary.

263
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
Hey, tiny. Yeah?

264
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,600
Hey, sorry about the
things I was saying earlier.

265
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,800
Can't really tell you why
but I had to get you angry.

266
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,100
So, uh...

267
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,000
Anyway, sorry. It's okay.

268
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,700
Truth is, I have low
self-Esteem issues.

269
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,000
My old man treated meand
my brother like crap,

270
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,100
Right up till the day he died.

271
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,200
How'd he die? My brother shot him.

272
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,100
Okay.

273
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,100
Oh, crap. What is it?

274
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,500
What is going on?

275
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
What is it?

276
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,900
Oh! No! No! Tiny! Tiny!

277
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,300
Guard!

278
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,500
Guard!

279
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,500
Wait. So you're telling
me it wasn't moody?

280
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,300
Not unless he liked going
around dressed like a nurse.

281
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,800
Poor tiny, man.Poor giant tiny.
Wait, so this is this is, like

282
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,100
The ghost of some nurse who worked here
or something? I don't know, man.I guess.

283
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,500
At this point, "I don't
know" isn't working for me.

284
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,200
See, uh,I thought we were done.
I called Deacon.It's happening.

285
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,697
We're getting out tonight.

286
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,828
I guess we got to do
some quick research, then.

287
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,500
How?! I mean, maybe you haven't noticed

288
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,700
We're in jail.

289
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,100
You want to know about some nurse?

290
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,100
Why you want to know?
We got our reasons,

291
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
But, uh, we'll make it worth your while.

292
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,100
So, this nurse,she would have white hair,one
screwed up eye is that ringing a bell?

293
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,900
Yeah.Yeah, I remember
her. You remember her name?

294
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,400
No, that's still kind of fuzzy.

295
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,500
Give it to him.

296
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I earned these. Dean.

297
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Glockner nurse glockner. Nasty
old bitch worked here in the '70s.

298
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
You knew her? I met her once.

299
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,400
Had to geta tetanus shot.She damn
near jabbed the needle through my arm.

300
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,700
At least I got out of there
alive. What do you mean?

301
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,800
I've heard these stories.I
don't know if they were true.

302
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,000
Cons love to talk,but we're
all liars. What kind of stories?

303
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,700
Guys would go up with a cold. Next
thing you know, they're in a body bag.

304
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,619
A whole rash of heart
attacks young guys, old guys.

305
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,099
Heart attacks? Yeah.

306
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:26,076
The story was glockner
had it out for cons

307
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:30,565
And she did this, uh,charles
bronson thing with a hypodermic.

308
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,200
Anyway, that was the rumor.
Nobody ever proved anything.

309
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,800
Whatever happened to
glockner? I don't know.

310
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,700
I finished my bit and left.Next time
I landed back in here,she was gone.

311
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,044
Okay, so let's say those
stories on glockner were true.

312
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:44,224
It's a thought.

313
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,900
In life, she's a vigilante.In
death, same thing. Right

314
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,100
But how is she tied in
with the old cellblock?

315
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,000
And if she's going after
cons,why kill that one guard?

316
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,600
I did hear in the yard that that
guard wasn't exactly squeaky clean,so

317
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,600
Maybe she's going after anybody
that breaks a law,like me.

318
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,400
You heard in the yard? Yeah.

319
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,986
Does it bother you at all how
easily you seem to fit in here?

320
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:06,187
No, not really.

321
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,800
All right. Either way,we
need more info on glockner.

322
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,800
If she's buried if so, where?

323
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,800
And we got five hours to get it.

324
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,300
No, no.Don't give me that "we got
to see this thing through" look.

325
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
We are leaving tonight,no matter what.

326
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,600
I don't want to let Deacon down.We do owe
him. Yeah,but we don't owe him our lives, dean.

327
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Where you going?

328
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,400
I'm gonna go talk with our lawyer.

329
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,000
You want me to what?
Her name was glockner.

330
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,500
She worked here as a nurse in the '70s.

331
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,400
I need you to find out everything you
can about her but, most importantly

332
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,900
How she died and where
she's buried. Are you nuts?

333
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,700
Do you have any idea the
kind of trouble you're in?

334
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,500
I have a vague notion. Good

335
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,500
So let's forget about some random
nurse and talk about your case.

336
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,900
Mara it's mara, right? Yeah.

337
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,400
I get that you're trying to help me.

338
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,900
I do, but believe me when I say that
this is the best way that you can help.

339
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,700
Really? How?Explain that to
me. I wish I could,but I can'T.

340
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,698
I'm just gonna have to ask
you to trust me on this.

341
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,245
Why should I?

342
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,400
Hendrickson says you're
a monster. I'm a monster?

343
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,900
Well, hhe's wrong, okay?

344
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,800
I'm not what they say I am.

345
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,700
Everybody says that. Yeah.

346
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,500
If you're as smart a
P.D.As I think you are,

347
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,300
Then you can tell with just one look whether
or not your clients are guilty, just like that.

348
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,200
So I want you to look at me,really look,

349
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,600
And you tell me am I guilty?

350
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,800
We're not the bad guys.

351
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,700
Did she go for it? No. No, not so much.

352
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,200
But maybe she'll still come
around. We can't wait to find out.

353
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,900
We could give it another day. No, no,
no. We're leaving tonight, and that's it.

354
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,900
So we're just gonna let these people
die? Don't give me that,all right?

355
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,900
This was your stupid plan.I went along
with it,but we're sticking to the plan.

356
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,600
Okay.Uh, you leave.I'm gonna stay.

357
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,900
Don't turn away.Don't turn
away from me. Screw you.

358
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,500
What?!Screw you!

359
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,200
All right, hard case.I see the usual
methods ain't gonna work with you.

360
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,400
You too, sweetheart.

361
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,900
Take off.

362
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,800
I want to handle this alone.

363
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,502
Deacon, you are beating the
holy hell out of me, man.

364
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:06,273
Sorry, dean.

365
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,400
I thought I was going easy on you.

366
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,100
Just, uh,trying to make it look real.
Yeah. Well, mission accomplished.

367
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,400
Thanks. So, is it over?

368
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,900
No.Turns out, it wasn't moody. What?

369
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah. Then who?

370
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,900
Uh, we think it's some nurse who used to
work here,but we're shy on all the intel.

371
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,600
Which is why we should stick
around. Until we find it.

372
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
Oh,hey guys. You want to have
this fight for real, dean?

373
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,500
We got to go.We've got to go now!

374
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,000
Guys. We are leaving dean.

375
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,200
Otherwise, we'll be leaving in shackles
for milwaukee,with hendrickson as company.

376
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Oh, come on. Guys!

377
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,000
What?! What?!

378
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Your lawyer left this for you.

379
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,200
Would you look at that. Man,
I am freaking velvety smooth.

380
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,500
You want to, maybe,open it up after
you're done patting yourself on the back?

381
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,000
Wow. What?You want to
share with the class, dean?

383
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,000
Glockner died in the old
cellblock after moody bit it.

384
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Seems they had a little inmate uprising.

385
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,500
She got caught in the middle.

386
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,500
They dragged her to a solitary cell
gave hera severe cerebral edema.

387
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,800
Someone bashed her head in. Yeah.

388
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,300
Does it say where she's buried? Yep.

389
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,200
All right, then, let's get
you the hell out of here.

390
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,800
Don't worry, Deacon.We'll
get rid of this thing.

391
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,400
Good, 'cause I want it out of my prison.

392
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,600
Boys, uh...

393
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
I can't thank you enough for this.

394
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,100
I know it was asking a lot
but you still came through.

395
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,500
Your daddy raised you right.

396
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,200
Well, we owed you. Right.

397
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,400
Hope to see you again,huh?
Just not in here,okay?

398
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,600
Yeah, we'll do our best.

399
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,700
Oh...

400
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
Where do you want it? What?

401
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah, um...um...

402
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,600
Make it look real, son.

403
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,700
Oh, man, are you a sight for sore eyes.

404
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,727
You know, I almost wish I
could see hendrickson's face.

405
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:33,901
Really?'Cause I'd be happy
if I never saw him again.

406
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,800
We're not really out of the
woods yet, dean, you know? Yeah.

407
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,700
Good point.

408
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,200
I told you.One of
them came up behind me.

409
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,400
You let them get the drop on you. Yeah.

410
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,400
I screwed up, all right?
What do you want me to say?

411
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,400
I want to know where they're headed.

412
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,400
How the hell would I know?
Let's start over again.

413
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,300
For god's sake. Again

414
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,300
I want to know everything they did
today,from the minute they woke up.

415
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,800
Got up...

416
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,100
Breakfast,visiting hours,rec time.

417
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Any visitors? Just their lawyer.

418
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,900
It's an easy question. What
did you and Dean talk about?

419
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,300
I have already told you.It was a private
conversation between me and my client.

420
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,200
Right, and three hours later
he just happened to bust out.

421
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,700
Now,tell me what he said.

422
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,500
We got to move it.If
hendrickson gets to the lawyer...

423
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,200
I thought she couldn't say anything you know,
that whole lawyer client privilege thing.

424
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,600
The privilege doesn't
apply, dean. So she'll talk?

425
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,200
She has to.

426
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,400
That's freaking super.

427
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,900
Let me make this simple.

428
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You don't come clean,I will put you
on the hook for aiding and abetting.

429
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,900
That is ridiculous. You
don't think that I can?!

430
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,800
You think this is some
kind of game, lady?!

431
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,400
I am the last person
you want to screw with.

432
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,800
Now, tell me...

433
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,500
What he said.

434
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,700
He wanted me to do some research

435
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,700
On a prison nurse that
died in 1976. What? Why?

436
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,200
I don't know. What else?

437
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,500
They wanted to know where she was
buried. Did you find out where?

438
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,500
Yeah. Did you tell them?

439
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,400
Yeah.

440
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,700
Tell me.

441
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,300
Mountainside Cemetery

442
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,300
Got her.

443
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,000
You let those two go.

444
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,100
Are you sure this is
the right damn cemetery?

445
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,500
She said mountainside
mountainside cemetery.

446
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,900
Thought we were screwed
before? Yeah, I know.

447
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,400
We got to go deep this
time. "Deep," dean?

448
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,000
We should go to yemen. Ooh, I'm

449
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,500
I'm not sure I'm ready to go that deep.
