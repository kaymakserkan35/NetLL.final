1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,543
You did it.

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,978
What, what did I do?

3
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,212
You opened the door.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,547
<i>Lilith was the final seal.</i>

5
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,083
I killed her and I set, Lucifer free.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,685
# it was a Monday #

7
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:21,787
# day like any other day #

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,655
# I left a small town #

9
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,457
# for the apple in decay #

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,359
# it was my destiny #

11
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:29,260
# it's what we needed to do #

12
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:31,663
# they were telling me #

13
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:32,931
# I'm telling you #

14
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,700
Jonesing for another hit
of bitch blood or what?

15
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:35,801
# I was inside #

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,870
<i>you're the, Michael sword.</i>

17
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,771
- What do you mean, I'm the sword?
- You're, Michael's weapon.

18
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,339
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,142
Rufus turner, he's a hunter.

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,945
I'm what you've got to look
forward to if you survive.

21
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,547
# paying a penance #

22
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,782
# I was longing for home #

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,784
Need some help here!

24
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,520
# I'm looking out for the two of us #

25
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,821
What the hell was that?

26
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,455
An enochian sigil.

27
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,258
It'll hide you from every angel
in creation, including Lucifer.

28
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,060


29
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,029
Ellen... it was my fault.

30
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,263
But, Jo did good out there.

31
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,865
You're angry. I understand.

32
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,167
Angry? "Angry" doesn't
begin to touch it!

33
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,636
Is this about me hunting
or something else?

34
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,104


35
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:15,974


36
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,310
You chose a demon, over your own brother.

37
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:20,746
I just don't think I can trust you.

38
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,499
What's it been... like, three days now?

39
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,570
We got to cheer him up.

40
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,438
Maybe I'll give him a back rub.

41
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:47,472
Dean.

42
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,074
Well, what then?

43
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,445
Look...

44
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:55,447
We might have to wrap
our heads around the idea

45
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:58,316
That, Bobby might not just
bounce back this time.

46
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,057
What's in the envelope?

47
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,291
Went to radiology

48
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:07,726
got some glamor shots.

49
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,930
Let's just say the doctors are baffled.

50
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,799
Holy crap.

51
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,333
Yeah well, Cass carved you one too.

52
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,141
Hello?

53
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,509
Castiel?

54
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,177
Speak of the devil.

55
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,546
Uh... St. Martin's hospital.

56
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,481
Why? what are you...

57
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:30,782
Cass?

58
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,186


59
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:37,022


60
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,494
Cellphone, Cass? really?

61
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:44,596
Since when do angels need to
reach out and touch someone?

62
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,965
You're hidden from
angels now... all angels.

63
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,533
I won't be able to simply...

64
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,901
Enough fore-play.

65
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,337
Get over here and lay
your damn hands on.

66
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,643
Get healing... Now.

67
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,810
I can't.

68
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,217
Say again?

69
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:11,422
I'm cut off from heaven
and much of heaven's power.

70
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,792
Certain things I can do,
certain things I can't.

71
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,995
You're telling me you
lost your mojo just in time,

72
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,998
to get me stuck in this
trap the rest of my life?!

73
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,733
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,169
Shove it up your ass.

75
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,206
Well, at least he's talking now.

76
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,908
I heard that.

77
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,778
I don't have much time, we need to talk.

78
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:33,912
Okay.

79
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,547
Your plan to kill, Lucifer.

80
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:36,614
Yeah, you want to help?

81
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,583
No, it's foolish. It can't be done.

82
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,685
Oh well, thanks for the support.

83
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,687
But I believe I have the solution.

84
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,555
There is someone besides, Michael

85
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:44,990
strong enough to take on, Lucifer.

86
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,325
Strong enough to stop the apocalypse.

87
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,860
Who's that?

88
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,731
The one who resurrected me
and put you on that airplane.

89
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,666
The one who began everything.

90
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,600
God.

91
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:01,073
I'm gonna find god.

92
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,417
- God?
- Yes.

93
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:12,984
- God.
- Yes.

94
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,420
He isn't in heaven.
he has to be somewhere.

95
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:17,555
Try New Mexico. I hear
he's on a tortilla.

96
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,958
No, he's not on any flat-bread.

97
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,394
listen chuckles, even if there is a god,

98
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,831
he is either dead and
that's the generous theory.

99
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,298
He is out there, Dean.

100
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:28,834
...or he's up and kicking

101
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,169
and doesn't give a rat's
ass about any of us.

102
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,874
I mean, look around you, man.
the world is in the toilet.

103
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,210
We are literally at
the end of days here,

104
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,579
And he's off somewhere
drinking booze out of a coconut.

105
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,814
- All right?
- Enough.

106
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,983
This is not a theological issue.

107
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,484
It's strategic.

108
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,186
With god's help, we can win.

109
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,554
It's a pipe dream, Cass.

110
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,590
I killed two angels this week.

111
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,925
My brothers.

112
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm hunted, I rebelled

113
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,629
and I did it, all
of it for you.

114
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:58,964
And you failed.

115
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:02,500
You and your brother
destroyed the world.

116
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,003
And I lost everything, for nothing.

117
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,708
So keep, your opinions to yourself.

118
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,047
You didn't drop in just
to tear us a new hole.

119
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,315
What is it you want?

120
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,918
I did come for something.

121
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,052
An amulet.

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,487
An amulet?

123
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:23,755
What kind?

124
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,324
Very rare, very powerful.

125
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,227
It burns hot in god's presence.
it'll help me find him.

126
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:31,963
Ah, a god EMF?

127
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,334
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about.

128
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,535
I got nothing like that.

129
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,237
I know, you don't.

130
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:50,782
What... this?

131
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,783
May I borrow it?

132
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,118
No.

133
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,853
Dean, give it to me.

134
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,797
All right, I guess.

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,740
Don't lose it.

136
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,684
Oh great, now I feel naked.

137
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,220
I'll be in touch.

138
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,363
When you find god,
tell him to send legs!

139
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,744
Your belt, your belt!

140
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,047
Here, hold this.

141
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,750
Aaah!

142
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:07,592
Hello?

143
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:08,626
Bobby, Bobby,

144
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,095
damn it can you hear me?

145
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:11,129
Ruf...

146
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,864
I can't hear you.

147
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,199
Listen, I need a little help.

148
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,301
Seems I'm up to my ass in demons,

149
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,903
whole damn town's infested.

150
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,405
Where are you?

151
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:23,041
pass... rado.

152
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,943
- Coloro...
- Colorado?

153
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,577
River pass, Colorado?

154
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:27,245
River pass!

155
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,147
Rufus?

156
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,415
You there? Ruf... Rufus

157
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,249


158
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,150
Bobby, it's...

159
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:36,721


160
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,005
This is the only road in or out.

161
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,140
No signal.

162
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,077
Rufus was right, demons
got this place locked down.

163
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,645
Looks like we're hiking in

164
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,014
and the hits just keep on coming.

165
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,649
# when I die and they lay me to rest #

166
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,252
# gonna go to the place that's the best #

167
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,322
# when I lay me down to die #

168
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,459
# goin' up to the spirit in the sky #

169
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,195
# goin' up to the spirit in the sky #

170
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,864
# spirit in the sky #

171
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,566
# that's where I'm gonna go when I die #

172
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,835
# when I die #

173
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,370
# when I die and they lay me to rest #

174
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:37,342
# I'm gonna go to the
place that's the best #

175
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,424
# prepare yourself #

176
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,460
# you know it's a must #

177
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,665
# got to have a friend in Jesus #

178
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,367
# so you know that when you die #

179
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,246
Ellen?

180
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,447
Hello, boys.

181
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,453
Ellen, what the heck's going on here?

182
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,261
We're us.

183
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,546
Real glad to see you boys.

184
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,486
The can of whup ass I
ought to open on you.

185
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,287
Ow!

186
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,755
You can't pick up a phone?

187
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,291
What are you, allergic
to giving me peace of mind?

188
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,460
I got to find out that
you're alive from, Rufus?!

189
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,462
Sorry, Ellen. Yeah you better be.

190
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,897
You better put me on speed dial kid.

191
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:39,898
Yes ma'am.

192
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,110
What's going on, Ellen?

193
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,911
More than I can handle alone.

194
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,580
How many demons are there?

195
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,948
Pretty much... whole town,

196
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,418
Minus the dead people and these guys.

197
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,153
So... this is it, right?

198
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,555
End times?

199
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,125
It's got to be.

200
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,126
Seems like it.

201
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,165
It's me.

202
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,989
This is, Sam and Dean.

203
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,390
They're hunters, here to help.

204
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,126
You guys hip to this whole demon thing?

205
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,228
Yeah, are you?

206
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,831
My wife's eyes turned black,
she came at me with a brick.

207
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,134
Kind of makes you
embrace the paranormal.

208
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,070
All right, catch us up.

209
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,972
I doubt I know much more than you.

210
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,476
Rufus called, said he was
in town investigating omens.

211
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,378
All of a sudden, the
whole town was possessed.

212
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,513
Me and Jo were nearby.

213
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,847
You're hunting with, Jo?

214
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,949
Yeah, for a while now.

215
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,518
We got here and the place,

216
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,453
well, the place was like you see it.

217
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,888
Couldn't find, Rufus then
me and Jo got separated.

218
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,291
I was out looking when I found you.

219
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,992
Don't worry, we'll find her.

220
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,562
Either way, these people
cannot just sit here.

221
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,863
we got to get them out now.

222
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,831
No, it's not that
easy, I've been trying.

223
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,233
We already made a run for it once.

224
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,801
- What happened?
- There used to be 20 of us.

225
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,443
well, there's three of us now.

226
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,011
You don't know what it's like out there.

227
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,346
Demons are everywhere.

228
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,914
We won't be able to cover everybody.

229
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,183
What if we get everyone guns?

230
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,151
What, are you gonna arm
up baby bump over here?

231
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,853
More salt we can fire at once,
more demons we can keep away.

232
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,727
There's a sporting-goods store
we passed on main on the way in.

233
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:49,828
I bet they got guns.

234
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,098
All right, you stay.

235
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,766
- We'll go.
- What about...

236
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,902
If Jo and Rufus are out
there, we'll bring them back.

237
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,746
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. hold on.

238
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,248
Why don't I just go?

239
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,049
What? alone?

240
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,785
Well, yeah. somebody's got to stay
here and start giving them shotgun 101.

241
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,588
- Yeah... Ellen.
- No, no, no.

242
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,690
It's gonna go a lot faster
if you stay and help, okay?

243
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:20,192
while you go get guns and
salt and look for, Jo and Rufus?

244
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,260
That's stupid.

245
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,595
I can handle it.

246
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,100
You don't want me going out there.

247
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,968
I didn't say that.

248
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,704
- Around demons.
- I didn't say that.

249
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,071
Fine then let's go.

250
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,614
I'll get the salt, you get the guns.

251
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,814
We'll go together.

252
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,082
Dean, it's right there.

253
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,051
Can we at least do
this like professionals?

254
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,601
Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus.

255
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:22,823
Sammy?

256
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,989
Okay, Roger, try again.

257
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Then snap it in.

258
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,764
You know your way around a gun at all?

259
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:14,910
Hmm.

260
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:16,178
Where'd you serve?

261
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:19,382
Fallujah, two tours.

262
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,484
Got back a little over a year ago.

263
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,619
Takes one to know one.

264
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:24,653
Where'd you serve?

265
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,222
Hell.

266
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,825
No, seriously.

267
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:31,494
Seriously.

268
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:32,495
Hell.

269
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,837
Hey.

270
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:43,138
Hey.

271
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:49,344
What's wrong?

272
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,585
Just... at the store.

273
00:17:56,653 --> 00:18:00,989
Those demons were possessing teenagers.

274
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:03,392
I mean, I had to slit some kid's throat.

275
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,560
come on, Sam you had to.

276
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,896
I know, I just it used to be like...

277
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:11,400
I just wish I could save
people, like I used to.

278
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,238
What... you mean when you were
all hopped up on demon blood?

279
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:18,307
I-I didn't say that.

280
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:19,308
I'll be back.

281
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,476
Where you going?

282
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:21,877
I can't sit here on my ass.

283
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,312
My daughter's out there somewhere.

284
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm not back in half an hour, go.

285
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:25,881
Get these people out of here.

286
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:27,215
No, wait.

287
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:28,517
I'll go with you.

288
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,786
Whoa, hold on. Can I
talk to you for a second?

289
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,125
You're gonna go out there again?

290
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:39,361
Well crap doesn't hit
the fan with coffee breaks.

291
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:40,796
I'll go.

292
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:42,731
It's fine, just stay here get
'em ready I'll cover, Ellen.

293
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,166
Why's it got to be you?

294
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:46,134
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

295
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:47,970
You think I'll take one look at a demon,

296
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,705
and suddenly fall off the wagon, as if

297
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:52,374
after everything, I
haven't learned my lesson.

298
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:53,642
Well, have you?

299
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:59,047
If you actually think I...

300
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:16,632
So, where'd you see her last?

301
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,133
Up ahead.

302
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:23,372
So, what's up with you and Dean?

303
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,942
It was hard not to notice,

304
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,678
how different things are
between you guys these days.

305
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:33,215
Lot of bad road there, huh?

306
00:19:33,282 --> 00:19:35,951
What happened? some girl
come between you or something?

307
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,286
Just... stresses of the job

308
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:39,889
you know how it is.

309
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:42,157
Kind of surprised,
you and Jo hunting.

310
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:45,027
Weren't you always saying
she couldn't hack the life?

311
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:46,762
She can't.

312
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,397
But if she's gonna do it anyway...

313
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:49,698
You want to keep an eye on her.

314
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:52,801
Hey.

315
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:57,773
Is that a chimney going?

316
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:59,341
Looks like it.

317
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:00,375
Huh.

318
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:02,144
Come on.

319
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:21,830
Guess we found base camp.

320
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:28,604
Demons don't get cold.

321
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:32,240
Makes you wonder what they're burning.

322
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:40,248
Don't move, you evil skank!

323
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,466
Don't you hurt
her, don't you.

324
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,235
Give me my mom back,
you black-eyed bitch!

325
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,343
Ellen, Run!

326
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:18,553
Got you now, you bastard.

327
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:45,520
Unh-unh.

328
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:49,090
No way you're getting out of those.

329
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:50,825
Did you up myself.

330
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:55,096
You're stuck right where I want you.

331
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:00,935
You evil son of a bitch.

332
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:12,747
No.

333
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:14,382
W-wait, wait, wait.

334
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,584
Just, just wait.

335
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,987
Exorcizamus te.

336
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:21,455
Stop!

337
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:22,691
omnis satanica.

338
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,992
Please!

339
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,995
the lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

340
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:29,397
He layeth me down in green pastures,

341
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,632
and he raiseth me up again.

342
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,069
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

343
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:35,170
I shall fear no evil.

344
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:47,415
Where's Sam?

345
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,389
They took him?

346
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,092
Demons took him?

347
00:22:58,493 --> 00:22:59,894
Oh, my god.

348
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,662
What if they're in
here, the demons?

349
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:02,764
Could they get in?

350
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:04,265
No.

351
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,102
Everybody sit tight.

352
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:08,502
I gotta...

353
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,484
Okay, we need to get a plan
together, tell me everything.

354
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:24,853
Please! come on!

355
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,420
Omnis immundus.

356
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,757
Look, something's not right.

357
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,958
Do you see that?

358
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:31,692
Geez!

359
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:33,728
Come on!

360
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:36,097
Stop, listen to me.

361
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:47,275
Wait a second.

362
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,477
- Why isn't it working?
- I don't know.

363
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:51,846
Look, listen to me
something's not right.

364
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:54,249
But he's not as strong
as he thinks he is.

365
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:56,117
You can see that.

366
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,786
Please, please.

367
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,654
Just listen to me.

368
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,422
Dean one of them's in, Jo.

369
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,691
We got to get it out
without hurting her.

370
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,794
It called me a bitch.

371
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:08,997
Bruise a little easy, don't you think?

372
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,598
No, that's not what I meant.

373
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,633
It called me a black-eyed bitch.

374
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,137
What kind of demons are these?

375
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,072
Holy water and salt roll right off.

376
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,108
My daughter may be an
idiot, but she's not stupid.

377
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:23,211
She wears an anti-possession charm.

378
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,181
It's all kind of weird, right?

379
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:28,416
The whole thing's off.

380
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:29,650
What's your instinct?

381
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,419
My instinct?

382
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:34,355
My instinct is to call, Bobby
and ask for help or Sam.

383
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:37,025
Well tough, all you got's
me and all I got's you.

384
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,960
So let's figure it out.

385
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:40,195
All right.

386
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:44,732
Do you know why, Rufus came to town?

387
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,467
Was there a specific omen?

388
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,102
He said something about water.

389
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,904
That's all I know.

390
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:52,740
Padre, you know what she's
talking about, the water?

391
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,608
Uh, the...

392
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:57,411
The river, ran polluted all of a sudden.

393
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,713
When?

394
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,981
Last Wednesday.

395
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:03,117
And the demon thing
started up the next day.

396
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,353
Anything else? anything.

397
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:08,957
Maybe, but it's pretty random.

398
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:10,291
Good, random's good.

399
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,193
Shooting star, does that count?

400
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,096
Real big, same night Wednesday.

401
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:17,966
That definitely counts.

402
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,512
So uh, you think that all
this comes from outer space?

403
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,614
This isn't "x files," pal.

404
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:40,321
"and there fell a great star from heaven,

405
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:43,324
"burning like a torch,
and it fell upon the river,

406
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,726
"and the name of the star was worm-wood.

407
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,061
And many men died."

408
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,763
Revelation 8:10.

409
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,200
Are you saying that this
is about, the apocalypse?

410
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,735
You could say.

411
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,939
And these specific omens,
they're prelude to what?

412
00:25:58,007 --> 00:25:59,207
The four horsemen,

413
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:00,708
and which one rides the red horse?

414
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:01,642
War.

415
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,579
That cherry mustang parked on main?

416
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,048
You can't think, that a car.

417
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:08,316
It's the way I'd roll.

418
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:13,054
I mean, think about it.

419
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:14,655
It all makes sense.

420
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,457
If war is a dude and he's here,

421
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:17,892
Maybe he's messing with our heads

422
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,127
turning us on each other.

423
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:20,994
You said, Jo called
you a black-eyed bitch.

424
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:23,864
they think we're demons.
we think they're demons.

425
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,166
What if there are no demons at all

426
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,734
and we're all just killing each other?

427
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,303
Wait, just back up.

428
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,171
It's the apocalypse?

429
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,739
Sorry, padre.

430
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:44,018
Who the hell are you?

431
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:48,423
what are you?

432
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:52,893
You caught me, popped in to watch.

433
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:53,928
I can hustle like that.

434
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:58,933
so, the Roger everyone around
here knows, the real Roger?

435
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,335
Buried in a ditch.

436
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:02,670
Mm-hmm.

437
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,043
so, who are you?

438
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,647
Here's a hint.

439
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,116
I was in, Germany.

440
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:16,484
Then in, Germany.

441
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,687
Then in the, middle east.

442
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:22,223
I was in, Darfur when my beeper went off.

443
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,459
I'm waiting to hook up with my siblings.

444
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:26,727
I've got three.

445
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,863
We're gonna have so much fun together.

446
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,469
I know who you are.

447
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:38,006
There aren't any demons
in town, are there?

448
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,540
Nope.

449
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:42,043
Just frightened people ripping
each other's throats out.

450
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:44,012
I really haven't had to do too much.

451
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,115
Take out a bridge here, lay in
a little hallucination there,

452
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:50,885
sit back, pop some corn, watch the show.

453
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:55,490
Frankly, you're really
vicious little animals, Sam.

454
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:56,690
No.

455
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,725
you're doing this.

456
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:58,826
Please.

457
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,761
Last week, this was Mayberry.

458
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,897
Now these people are stabbing
each other's children.

459
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:04,332
'cause you made them see demons!

460
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,502
Honestly, people don't need
a reason to kill each other.

461
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,504
I mean, you seen the Irish?

462
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:11,639
They're all Irish.

463
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,011
You think I'm a monster.

464
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,014
I'm Jello shots at a party,
I just remove inhibitions.

465
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:21,482
I'm gonna kill you myself.

466
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,985
Oh that's adorable,
considering you're my poster boy.

467
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,357
What's that supposed to mean?

468
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:32,193
You can't stop thinking about it,

469
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:34,762
ever since you saw it dripping
off the blade of that knife.

470
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,066
You're wrong.

471
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,201
Save your protests for your brother.

472
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:42,503
I can see inside your head

473
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:45,306
and man, it is one-track city in there.

474
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:48,209
Blood, blood, blood.

475
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,817
Lust

476
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,486
for power.

477
00:28:58,554 --> 00:28:59,920
Same as always.

478
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,689
You want to be strong again,

479
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:03,891
but not just strong.

480
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,727
stronger than everybody.

481
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:11,165
Good intentions, quick
slide to hell, buddy boy.

482
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,636
you feel bad now?

483
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:18,205
Wait till you're thigh-deep in warm corpses.

484
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:23,377
Because my friend, I'm
just getting started.

485
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:36,190
Show-time for the meat suits.

486
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:37,325
Watch this.

487
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,537
Aaah!

488
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:51,506
Aaah!

489
00:29:53,342 --> 00:29:55,343
- He did it!
- No

490
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,112
He said they're coming, he
said they're coming to get us!

491
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,080
Stop Jo, Rufus he's lying.

492
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:01,782
You shut your mouth.

493
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,317
Please Jo! he's lying!

494
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,355
So now you're saying
that there are no demons

495
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:09,157
And that war is a guy.

496
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,091
You believed crazy before.

497
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:14,495
Open up, Let me in!

498
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,829
It's me!

499
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:20,201
I saw them, the demons.

500
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:22,603
They know we're trying to leave.

501
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:25,005
They said they're gonna
pick us off one by one.

502
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,307
Wait, wait, wait. what?

503
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,608
I thought you said there were no demons.

504
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,076
There's not, where did you go?

505
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:30,545
I thought someone should go
out and see what's going on!

506
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:32,346
Where did you see the demons
and what did they say exactly?

507
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,581
We just sit here, we're gonna be dead.

508
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:35,082
No, we're not!

509
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,251
They're gonna kill us,
unless we kill them first.

510
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,286
Okay hold on, hold on.

511
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,820
No man, we got people to protect.

512
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:42,089
All right, the able-bodied
go hunt some demons.

513
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:44,124
Whoa, whoa, whoa slow your roll.

514
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:45,726
this is not a demon thing.

515
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,299
Look at their eyes!

516
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:52,300
they're demons!

517
00:30:58,473 --> 00:30:59,373
Go, go!

518
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,102
Hope those are real.

519
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,371
Those two could have been
demons the entire time.

520
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:15,806
All this salt and holy-water talk,

521
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,309
as far as I'm concerned, it's all crap.

522
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,411
Are you sure?

523
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:22,713
It's them or us.

524
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,850
I think I saw some
knives in the kitchen.

525
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,151
Great.

526
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,086
Go.

527
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,298
Hey, Rufus.

528
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:41,866
Yeah.

529
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,968
Pipe bombs won't kill a demon.

530
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,004
Right.

531
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:50,041
But in my experience...

532
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,477
Demons come at you slower

533
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,612
If they're in a body with no limbs.

534
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,280
One of them is in my mother.

535
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,221
Jo, listen to me, you know
I'm gonna do everything I can.

536
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,788
Your mom's gonna be okay.

537
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,593
Unless she comes through that window.

538
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,377
All right, let's move.

539
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,579
Stay low, move fast.

540
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,995
Rufus!

541
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,705
Now, you listen up
Joanna Beth Harvelle.

542
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,512
Listen to me, I'm not a demon.

543
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,347
Think, Rufus all those omens.

544
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,615
You go to hell.

545
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,657
Rufus!

546
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,059
The polluted water, the shooting star,

547
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,928
the red mustang it's war.

548
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,330
I'm telling you, it's war.

549
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,831
You're damn right it is.

550
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,540
The horseman!

551
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:03,674
Horseman?

552
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,576
Yes, he's turning us against each other.

553
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:06,910
You're hallucinating.

554
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:13,984
The horseman.

555
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,019
War.

556
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,187
Yes.

557
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,391
Did you figure this out
all by yourself, genius?

558
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,001
Whoa. whoa.

559
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,538
We all on the same page?

560
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,575
Good.

561
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,742
Hi, Jo.

562
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,278
Hey.

563
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:42,246
Okay... we got to find war

564
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,081
Before everybody in this
town kills each other.

565
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,587
Damn it!

566
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:50,555
- Where's, Sam?
- Upstairs.

567
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,056
Take this.

568
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,260
All right, you three go around back.

569
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,795
Take the alley.

570
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,765
Dean, It's not demons.

571
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,301
- It's war.
- War.

572
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,868
I just can't figure
out how he's doing it.

573
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,671
The ring.

574
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,406
The ring, the ring that's right.

575
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,541
He turned it right before
he made everybody hallucinate

576
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,875
- and go hell-bitch.
- Right.

577
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:15,646
We got to move, come on.

578
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,237
People, cease fire!

579
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,838
Stop shooting!

580
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,573
Stop!

581
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,176
I'm getting too old for this.

582
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,329
I'm not what you think honey.
come on, keep this right here.

583
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,972
"Stop firing" usually
means "stop firing."

584
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,703
Oh!

585
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,377
Whoa, look.

586
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,714
That's a sweet little knife.

587
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:57,981
But come on.

588
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,983
You can't kill war, kiddos.

589
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,151
Oh, we know.

590
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:03,654
Aaah!

591
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:48,955
So, pit-stop at mount doom.

592
00:37:57,707 --> 00:37:59,641
- Dean.
- Sam, let's not.

593
00:37:58,708 --> 00:37:59,742


594
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:01,810
No, listen, this is important.

595
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:03,912
I know you don't trust me.

596
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,383
Just... now I realize something.

597
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,653
I don't trust me either.

598
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,957
from the minute I saw that blood,

599
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:15,691
Only thought in my head,

600
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:23,266
and I tell myself it's
for the right reasons,

601
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,768
my intentions are good,

602
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,503
and it... it feels true, you know?

603
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,405
But I think, underneath...

604
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,177
...I just miss the feeling.

605
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:37,346
I know how messed up that sounds,

606
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:40,416
which means I know
how messed up I am.

607
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,021
Thing is, the problem's not
the demon blood... not really.

608
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,357
and what I did, I can't
blame the blood or, Ruby

609
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:56,932
or... anything, problems me.

610
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:05,674
How far I'll go. There's
something in me, that

611
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:12,381
...scares the hell out of me, Dean and
the last couple of days I caught a little glimpse

612
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:20,623
- So what are you saying.
- I'm in no shape to be hunting.

613
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:24,760
I need to step back,
'cause I'm dangerous.

614
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:32,001
Maybe it's best we just,
go our separate ways.

615
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:45,448
- Well, I think you're right.
- I was expecting a fight.

616
00:39:45,515 --> 00:39:48,218
Truth is I spend more time worrying about you

617
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:51,020
than about doing the job right,

618
00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:57,333
I just can't afford that,
you know. Not now.

619
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,534
- I'm sorry, Dean.
- I know you are, Sam.

620
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:23,550
- Hey, you uh... wanna take the Impala?
- It's okay.

621
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:43,839
- Take care of yourself, Dean.
- Yeah you too, Sammy.
