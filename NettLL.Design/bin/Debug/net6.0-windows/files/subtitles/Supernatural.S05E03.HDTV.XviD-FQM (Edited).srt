1
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,884
You think I'll take 
one look at a demon

2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:05,053
and suddenly fall off the wagon?

3
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,889
As if after everything, 
I haven't learned my lesson.

4
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:08,724
Well, have you?

5
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,126
This is my girlfriend, Jessica.

6
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:13,128
No! Jess!

7
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:14,562
So, what are you gonna do?

8
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,631
You just gonna live
some normal, apple-pie life?

9
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:17,632
Not normal, Safe.

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,834
I'm a vessel?

11
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,668
You're the vessel, 
Michael's vessel?

12
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:21,837
The answer's no.

13
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:23,071
Where's, Cass?

14
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:24,505
The archangel smote 
the crap out of him.

15
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:25,640
How are you...

16
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:26,975
Alive?

17
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,443
That's a good question.

18
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,678
I just wish I could save people,
like I used to.

19
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:33,081
What... you mean when you were
all hopped up on demon blood?

20
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,783
Your plan to kill, Lucifer.

21
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:36,484
It's foolish, it can't be done.

22
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:37,652
I have the solution.

23
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,987
I'm gonna find god.

24
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,022
Try New Mexico.
I hear he's on a tortilla.

25
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,391
I killed two angels this week.

26
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:46,128
I rebelled and I did it, all of it... for you

27
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:47,362
and you failed.

28
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:48,864
I'm in no shape to be hunting.

29
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:51,499
Maybe it's best we just
go our separate ways.

30
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:53,601
Well, I think you're right.

31
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,248

Hey, baby.

34
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:19,326
I missed you.

35
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,230
Jessica?

36
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,100
I'm dreaming.

37
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,103
Or you're not.

38
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,171
What's the difference? I'm here.

39
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:33,340


40
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:39,146
I miss you so much.

41
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:41,248
I know.

42
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,519
I miss you, too.

43
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:49,290
What are you doing, Sam?

44
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:52,827
What do you mean?

45
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,962
Running away.

46
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,031
Haven't we been
down this road before?

47
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:58,032
No.

48
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,167
It's different now.

49
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:01,368
Really?

50
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:05,640
Last time, I wanted to be normal.

51
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:10,210
This time... I know I'm a freak.

52
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:13,013
Which is all a big ball of semantics.

53
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,181
You know that.

54
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:15,282
No.

55
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,618
Even at Stanford you knew.

56
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,787
You knew there was
something dark inside of you.

57
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:23,758
Deep down maybe, but... you knew.

58
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:26,126
Baby, that's what got me killed.

59
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:29,864
No.

60
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:31,499
I was dead from the
moment we said hello.

61
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:32,834
No.

62
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:35,035
Don't you get it?

63
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,237
You can't run from yourself.

64
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:39,774
why are you running now?

65
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:42,209
Why are you here, Jess?

66
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,879
Would you believe I'm actually
trying to protect you?

67
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:45,847
From what?

68
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:47,314
You.

69
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:50,217
Sooner or later, the past
is gonna catch up to you,

70
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:51,953
Like it always does.

71
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,420
You know what happens then?

72
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:58,359
People die.

73
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,595
Baby, the people
closest to you die.

74
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:04,131
Well, don't worry, because
I won't make that mistake again.

Me and Sam are taking
separate vacations for a while.

00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:42,750
So... did you find god yet?

120
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,952
More importantly, can I have
my damn necklace back, please?

121
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,454
No, I haven't found him.

That's why I'm here.
I need your help.

124
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:51,859
I'm not interested.

125

It's not god, it's someone else.

126
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,064
Who?

127
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:59,166
It's an archangel.

128
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:00,601

129
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:02,903
Excuse me?

130
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:04,171
His name is, Raphael.

132
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:12,112
I've heard whispers
that he's walking the earth.

133
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,815
This is a rare opportunity.

00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:16,851
Information.

136
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,053
So, what... you think if you find this dude,

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,288
he's just gonna spill god's address?

138
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,957
Yes.

139
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:25,192
because we are gonna trap
him and interrogate him.

140
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:30,765
You're serious about this.

141
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:34,669
Yes.

142
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,473
So, what... I'm, Thelma and you're, Louise,

143
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,874
and we're just gonna hold hands

144
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:42,176
and sail off this cliff together?

145
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:50,885
Give me one good reason
why I should do this.

146
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,520

Uh-huh.

00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:03,157
You blow into town last week,
you don't talk to anybody.

173
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:05,059

192
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:07,822
A deputy sheriff
laid eyes on the archangel.

193
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:10,758
And he still has eyes?

194
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:12,894
All right, what's the plan?

195
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:15,462
We...

196
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,332
Tell the officer that he
witnessed an angel of the lord.

197
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,101
Then the officer will tell us
where the angel is.

198
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,137
Are you serious?

199
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:25,039
You're gonna walk in there
and tell him the truth?

200
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:26,440
Why not?

201
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,543
Because... we're humans.

202
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,749
And when humans want something
really, really bad...

203
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:35,750
We lie.

204
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,385
Why?

205
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:42,056
Because... that's how
you become president.

206
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,260
Deputy, Framingham?

207
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:48,195
Hi.

208
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:50,031
Alonzo Mosely, FBI.

209
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:51,699
This is my partner, Eddie Moscone.

210
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:55,269
Also, FBI.

211
00:11:03,645 --> 00:11:05,613
He's, uh, he's new.

212
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,514
Mind if we ask you
a few questions?

213
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,750
Yeah sure, talk here, though.

214
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,920
Hearing's all blown to
hell in this one.

215
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:14,822
That happen recently?

216
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,357
Yeah... the gas-station thing.

217
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,526
That's why you're here, isn't it?

218
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:22,329
Yes, it is.

219
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:26,767
Do you mind just, uh, running us
through what happened?

220
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:29,036
Well, call came in...

221
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:31,538
Disturbance out at the
pump 'n' go on route 4.

222
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,140
What kind of disturbance?

223
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,043
Would not have believed my eyes
if I hadn't seen it myself.

224
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,613
We're talking a riot... full-scale.

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,748
How many? 30, 40.

226
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,618
In all-out, kill-or-be-killed combat.

227
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:44,951
Any idea what set them off?

228
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,255
It's angels and demons, probably.

229
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:50,424
They're skirmishing
all over the globe.

230
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,093
Come again? what did he say?

231
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,560
- Demons.
- Nothing.

232
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:58,198
Demons you know, drink adultery.

233
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:01,201
We all have our demons, Walt, right?

234
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:03,403
I guess.

235
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,441
Anyway... what happened next?

236
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,143
Freakin' explosion, that's what.

237
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,312
Oh, they said it was one
of those underground gas tanks,

238
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,682
But, uh... I don't think so.

239
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,017
Why not?

240
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:18,185
It wasn't your usual fireball.
it was, um...

241
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:19,086
Pure white.

242
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,556
Yeah.

243
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:25,425
Gas station was leveled.

244
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,895
Everyone was...

245
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,698
It was just horrible.

246
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,768
Then I see this one guy,
kneeling there,

247
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:36,503
Real focused-like.

248
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:37,972
Not a damn scratch on him.

249
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,106
You know him?

250
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,908
Donnie Finnerman... mechanic there.

251
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,143
And let me guess,

252
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,912
he just, uh... vanished into thin air?

253
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,548
Uh, no, kolchak.

254
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:48,849
He's down at, St. Pete's.

255
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,687
St. Pete's.

256
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,156
Thank you.

257
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:00,695
I take it that's not, Raphael anymore.

258
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:02,563
Just an empty vessel.

259
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,033
So, is this what I'm looking at
when, Michael jumps my bones?

260
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,367
No, not at all.

261
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,403
Michael is much more powerful.

262
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,371
It'll be far worse for you.

263
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,223


264
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,357


265
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:31,525


266
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:32,659
Sam?

267
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,895
Hey, Bobby, how you doin'?

268
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:37,898
Well, I ain't runnin'
any marathons, but...

269
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:38,933
I'll live.

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,567
Where are you?

271
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:43,670
Uh, Garber, Oklahoma.

272
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,740
I found a town up the road
showing some revelation omens.

273
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:46,841
What omens?

274
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:47,908
All right, listen to this.

275
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,309
"and upon his rising,

276
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:51,511
There shall be hail and fire
mixed with blood."

277
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:52,980
Well, ain't that delightful.

278
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:54,181
Yeah.

279
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,582
We already got hailstorms and fires.

280
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,118
I'm guessing blood
can't be too far behind.

281
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,253
Okay.

282
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,888
What?

283
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:03,023
There a reason you're calling?

284
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:07,427
Dean didn't tell you?

285
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:09,029
He told me.

286
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,198
Yeah, well... so I just thought

287
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,867
You might want to find out
who's in the area,

288
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,135
Put a man on this.

289
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:16,570
Okay, let me see
if I can think of

290
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:19,706
the best hunter who might be
in the immediate vicinity.

291
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,541
oh... that'd be you.

292
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,410


293
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:25,312
I can't, Bobby.
I'm sitting this one out.

294
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,446
- Sam...
- I got to go.

295
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,848
- I'm so sorry.
- Hold on. Sam.

296
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,683


297
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:32,086


298
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,576
Where have you been?

299
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,311
Jerusalem.

300
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:00,547
Oh. how was it?

301
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:01,581
Arid.

302
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:04,851
What is that?

303
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,085
It's oil.

304
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:09,322
It's very special and very rare.

305
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:14,094
Okay, are we gonna... trap
Raphael with a nice vinaigrette?

306
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:15,462
No.

307
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,797
So, this ritual of yours,
when's it got to go down?

308
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:19,833
Sunrise.

309
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,235
Tell me something you keep
saying we're gonna trap this guy,

310
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:22,536
But isn't that kind of like

311
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:24,238
Trapping a hurricane
with a butterfly net?

312
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:25,506
No. it's harder.

313
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:28,409
Do we have any chance
of surviving this?

314
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:29,710
you do.

315
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,448
So, odds are, you're a
dead man tomorrow?

316
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,583
Yes.

317
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,986
Oh.

318
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,522
Well, last night on earth.

319
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,725
What, uh... what are your plans?

320
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:48,928
I just thought
I'd sit here quietly.

321
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,899
Dude come on, anything?

322
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,167
Hmm? booze, women?

323
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:00,941
you have been with a
woman before, right?

324
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,376
Or an angel, at least?

325
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:08,149
You mean to tell me
you've never been up there

326
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,683
Doing a little cloud-seeding?

327
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,285
Look, I've never
had occasion, okay?

328
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:18,326
All right.

329
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,130
Let me tell you something.

330
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:23,631
There are two things
that I know for certain.

331
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:26,534
One, Bert and Ernie are gay.

332
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:30,371
two, you are not
gonna die a virgin.

333
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,839
not on my watch.

334
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:34,808
Let's go.

335
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:37,512
[ bob luman's "let's think
about living" plays ]

336
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,581
Hey, Sam.

337
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:43,251
Sam!

338
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:46,820
"Sam"? what happened to "Keith"?

339
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,659
W-what?

340
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:53,861
He called you, Sam.

341
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:55,796
Yeah, uh... Sam's my middle name.

342
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:58,166
"Keith Sam"?

343
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,400
Man, I'm sorry.

344
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,101
Well actually, it's uh, Samuel,

345
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,103
So it's not quite as dumb as it sounds.

346
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,305


347
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,106
Are you guys friends?

348
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,309
Huntin' buddies with his dad.

349
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:11,579
But, Samuel here
is quite the hunter himself.

350
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:13,013
Wow.

351
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,748
You kill deer and things?

352
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,651
Yeah, "and things."

353
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:18,852
Uh, why don't I
get you guys some drinks?

354
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:23,324
Sorry. didn't mean
to bust you back there.

355
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,060
No, it's uh, it's all right.

356
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,061
So, what's up?

357
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,229
Well, Bobby called.

358
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,630
And?

359
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:30,831
You were right...

360
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:32,966
Major demon block party going on.

361
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,368
But why? what are they up to?

362
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:35,736
Don't know yet.

363
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,339
Bobby told us
you were off limits.

364
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,240
That true?

365
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,311
Yeah, that's right.

366
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,246
Well, that's fine
in theory and all,

367
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,448
But we could really use
all hands on deck here.

368
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:48,716
I know you could.

369
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,152
But I can't, I'm sorry.

370
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:53,287
Why not?

371
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:57,091
It's personal.

372
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,760
Look, Sam no offense, but uh,
what baggage is so heavy,

373
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,296
It can't be stowed away for
the freakin' apocalypse, huh?

374
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,766
Like I said...

375
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,767
Yeah.

376
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,135
You're sorry.

377
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:09,437
Heard you the first time.

378
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:13,807
Okay.

379
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,409
Suit yourself.

380
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:18,078
More for us, then, right?

381
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:19,913
Good luck.

382
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,351
But, hey... beers are on you
when we get back.

383
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:24,685
Yeah, you bet.

384
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:30,558
So, your parents were drunk
when they named you,

385
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,593
And you shoot, Bambi?

386
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,027
I-it's a... long story.

387
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:35,329
That is it.

388
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:38,599
Enough with the, kung-fu,
wandering-the-earth thing.

389
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,468
I'm gonna buy you dinner,
and we're gonna talk.

390
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,871
Lindsey, I can't.

391
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:46,874
No, the only way to avoid
bloodshed is to say yes.

392
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:59,654
hey.

393
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:02,823
Relax.

394
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,358
This is a den of iniquity.

395
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,793
I should not be here.

396
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,229
Dude, you full-on rebelled
against heaven.

397
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:12,300
Iniquity is one of the perks.

398
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:13,367
Show-time.

399
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:17,004
Hi, what's your name?

400
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:23,877
Cass!

401
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,313
his name is, Cass.
what's your name?

402
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,781
Chastity.

403
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:27,948
Chastity?

404
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:29,617
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

405
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,420
Is that kismet or what buddy, huh?

406
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:35,889
well, he likes you,
and you like him, so...

407
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:38,058
Dayenu.

408
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,993
Mm. come on, baby.

409
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,701
Oh, hey, listen.

410
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,168
Take this.

411
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,304
If she asks for a credit card, no.

412
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:52,340
Now, just stick
to the basics, okay?

413
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,208
Do not order off the menu.

414
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,876
Go get her, tiger.

415
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:59,012
Don't make me push you.

416
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:07,955
Cheers to you.

417
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:09,890


418
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,893
Aaaaaaaaaah!

419
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,395
Get out of my face!

420
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,096
No! leave me alone!

421
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:19,266
Bastard! screw you, jerk!

422
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,134
I'll kill you!

423
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:23,036
Screw you, too!
god!

424
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:25,606
Ohh! jerk!

425
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,040
What the hell
did you do?

426
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,141
I don't know.

427
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,844
I just looked at her
in the eyes

428
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:31,579
And told her
it wasn't her fault

429
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,046
That her father, Gene ran off.

430
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:36,484
It was because he hated his job
at the post office.

431
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:38,185
Oh, no man.

432
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:39,587
What?

433
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,856
This whole industry
runs on absent fathers.

434
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:43,524
It's... it's the natural order.

435
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,459


436
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:47,762
We should go, come on.

437
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,767


438
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,072
What's so funny?

439
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,141


440
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,843
Oh, nothing.

441
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:04,412
Whew.

442
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,947
It's been a long time
since I've laughed that hard.

443
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:09,784


444
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,553
Oh, it's been more than a long time.

445
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:14,288
Years.

446
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,393
So...

447
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:21,729
you gonna tell me who those guys
back there really were?

448
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,330
And don't say
"hunting buddies."

449
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:24,865


450
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,000
Okay, um...

451
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:29,102
We used to be in the same business together.

452
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,203
What business?

453
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,608
How's your salad?

454
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,347
Witness protection, right? you're mafia?

455
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,216
I'm not mafia.

456
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:45,486
Okay. I get it.

457
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,687
I don't mean to pry. My bad.

458
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:56,497
I used to be in business
with my brother.

459
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,701
Truth is, I was...
pretty good at the job.

460
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,473
But... I made some mistakes.

461
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,342
You know, I-I did some stuff
I'm not so proud of.

462
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,177
And people got hurt.

463
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,380
a lot of people.

464
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:19,487
What was your poison?

465
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:21,822
Sorry?

466
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,491
Come on.

467
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,693
You were hooked on something.
I know the look.

468
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:33,133


469
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:35,402
Three years sober.

470
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,270
You work in a bar.

471
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:38,471
So do you.

472
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,409
Look, "Keith"...

473
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:44,578
I don't know you,

474
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:47,214
And I'm the last person
to be giving advice,

475
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:50,217
But I do know that...

476
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:53,186
No one has ever
done anything so bad,

477
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:57,157
They can't be forgiven.

478
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:59,292
That they can't change.

479
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:22,619
When the oil burns,

480
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:25,257
No angel can touch
or pass through the flames,

481
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:27,025
Or he dies.

482
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:28,993
Okay.

483
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:31,196
So we trap him
in a steel cage of holy fire.

484
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:33,031
But, uh, one question...

485
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:34,966
How the hell
do we get him here?

486
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:39,904
There's... well, almost an
open phone line...

487
00:23:39,972 --> 00:23:41,739
Between a vessel
and his angel.

488
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,810
One just has to know how to dial.

489
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:09,067
I'm here, Raphael.

490
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:11,969
Come and get me,
you little bastard.

491
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:21,846
Just out of curiosity, what is

492
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:25,517
the average customer wait time
to speak to an archangel?

493
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,420
Be ready.

494
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:51,543
Well, that's a day
I'll never get back.

495
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:53,478


496
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:58,549
Dean, wait.

497
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:00,518


498
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:12,830
Castiel.

499
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,432
Raphael.

500
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:19,437
I mean, I thought you were
supposed to be impressive.

501
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:21,373
All you do is black out the room?

502
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,608
And the eastern seaboard.

503
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:24,942


504
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:29,447
It is a testament
to my unending mercy

505
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:31,783
That I don't smite you
here and now.

506
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,184
Or maybe you're full of crap.

507
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:37,589
Maybe you're afraid

508
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:39,857
That god will bring, Cass
back to life again

509
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,893
and smite you, you candy-ass skirt.

510
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,096
By the way... Hi, I'm Dean.

511
00:25:45,164 --> 00:25:46,063
I know who you are.

512
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:51,536
and now, thanks to him,
I know where you are.

513
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:53,571
You won't kill him.

514
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,239
You wouldn't dare.

515
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:56,541
but I will take him to, Michael.

516
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:59,778
Well, that... sounds terrifying.

517
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:01,346
It does.

518
00:26:01,414 --> 00:26:05,483
But, uh, I hate to tell you...

519
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:08,820
I'm not going anywhere with you.

520
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:12,457
Surely you remember, Zachariah
giving you stomach cancer.

521
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:19,096
Yeah, that was...
that was hilarious.

522
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:21,032
Yes, well...

523
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:24,502
he doesn't have anything
close to my imagination.

524
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,570
Oh, yeah?

525
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:35,913
I bet you didn't imagine one thing.

526
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:37,349
What?

527
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:40,151
We knew you were coming,
you stupid son of a bitch.

528
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,871
Hey, don't look at me.
it was his idea.

529
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:08,112
Where is he?

530
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,981
God?

531
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,451
Didn't you hear?

532
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,319
He's dead, Castiel.

533
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:18,857
Dead.

534
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:25,296


535
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:27,198
Bar's closed.

536
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,635


537
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:32,737
Hey.

538
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:34,539
Is there something
you want to tell me, Sam?

539
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:35,573
What?

540
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:37,709
No.

541
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:40,344
You sure about that?

542
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:43,347
I-I don't...

543
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,717
Geez.

544
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:48,185
Are you okay?

545
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:50,254
Where are Reggie and Steve?

546
00:27:50,322 --> 00:27:51,756
Oh, Steve's good.

547
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:53,324
He's, uh...

548
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:55,192
His guts are laying roadside

549
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,094
Outside the Hawley five-and-dime.

550
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:01,433
I'm sorry.

551
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,834
"sorry" don't cut it, Sam.

552
00:28:02,902 --> 00:28:04,436
What do you
want me to say?

553
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:05,336
The truth.

554
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:10,207
Okay, fine.

555
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:13,010
Let me give you
some of my own, then.

556
00:28:13,078 --> 00:28:16,013
We go into town, we
capture ourselves a demon,

557
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:18,015
And we get jumped by 10 more.

558
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,051
Steve bought it.

559
00:28:21,854 --> 00:28:23,387
I'm sorry.

560
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:26,624
Saying it twice don't make it so, Sam.

561
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:30,261
But you see, this demon he, uh...

562
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:32,063
He told us things.

563
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,098
crazy things, things about you, Sam.

564
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,166
Demons lie.

565
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:37,001
Yeah?

566
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:40,972
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

567
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,274
The truth.

568
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:44,542
Now!

569
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,143


570
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:47,545


571
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:48,546
Lindsey!

572
00:28:48,614 --> 00:28:50,949


573
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:54,385
What's going on?

574
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,969
But there's no other explanation.

575
00:29:02,037 --> 00:29:03,604
He's gone for good.

576
00:29:03,672 --> 00:29:04,605
You're lying.

577
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:05,906
Am I?

578
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:09,210
Do you remember the 20th century?

579
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,213
Think the 21st is going any better?

580
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:14,549
You think god would have
let any of that happen

581
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:16,117
If he were alive?

582
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,520
Oh, yeah?

583
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:22,823
Well, then who invented
the Chinese basket trick?

584
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,125
Careful.

585
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:26,760
That's my father you're
talking about, boy.

586
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:28,563
Yeah, who would be so proud

587
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,366
to know that his sons
started the friggin' apocalypse.

588
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:34,535
Who ran off and disappeared.

589
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:38,739
Who left no instructions
and a world to run.

590
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,511
So daddy ran away and disappeared?

591
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:46,647
He didn't happen to work
for the post office, did he?

592
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,283
This is funny to you?

593
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:51,519
You're living in a godless universe.

594
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:53,554
And?

595
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:55,055
What... you and the other kids

596
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:57,358
Just decide to throw an
apocalypse while he's gone?

597
00:29:57,426 --> 00:29:59,927
We're tired.

598
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:02,830
We just want it to be over.

599
00:30:02,897 --> 00:30:05,500
We just want...

600
00:30:07,302 --> 00:30:08,569
...paradise.

601
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:13,073
So, what... god dies
and makes you the boss,

602
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:16,977
And you think you can do
whatever you want?

603
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:18,112
Yes.

604
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,748
And whatever we want, we get.

605
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:22,950


606
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:26,420
Let's just take it easy, okay?

607
00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:27,721
Put the knife down.

608
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,440
It's true.

609
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:49,443
What the demon said... it's all true.

610
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:50,545
Keep going.

611
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,480
Why?

612
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:55,183
Are you gonna hate me any less?

613
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,151
am I gonna hate myself any less?

614
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,887
What do you want?

615
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:00,921
I want to hear you say it.

616
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:10,598
I did it.

617
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,669
I started the apocalypse.

618
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:18,606
If god is dead, why have I returned?

619
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:20,441
Who brought me back?

620
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:24,579
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe, Lucifer raised you?

621
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:26,980
No.

622
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:28,849
Think about it.

623
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:32,253
He needs all the rebellious angels he can find.

624
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,423
You know it adds up.

625
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:40,461
Let's go.

626
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:41,929
Castiel.

627
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:43,531
I'm warning you.

628
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,798
Do not leave me here.

629
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:49,103
I will find you.

630
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:52,540
Maybe one day.

631
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:57,111
but today, you're my little bitch.

632
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,652
What he said.

633
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:14,194
What is that?

634
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:16,163
what do you think it is?

635
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:19,133
It's go juice, Sammy boy.

636
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,901
Get that away from me.

637
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,870
away from you? wrong.

638
00:32:22,937 --> 00:32:24,972
this is for you.

639
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,643
Hell, if that demon
wasn't right as rain.

640
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,511
Down the hatch, son.

641
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:32,012
You're insane.

642
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,382
Look, here's what's gonna happen.

643
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:37,151
You're gonna drink this, hulk out,

644
00:32:37,218 --> 00:32:39,787
And you're gonna waste
every one of those demon scum

645
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:40,821
That killed my best friend.

646
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,526
Or she dies.

647
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:48,329
You wouldn't do that.

648
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:51,365
It's funny how watching your
best friend die changes that.

649
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:54,435
Come on. You know you want it, Sam.

650
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:55,770
Just reach out and take it.

651
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,930
Mmmm!

652
00:33:22,997 --> 00:33:24,598


653
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:30,137


654
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,748
There, was that really so bad?

655
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,287
Ahh! ahh!

656
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:22,689
Go.

657
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,692
Don't think we won't be back.

658
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,193
Don't think I won't be here.

659
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,643
Hey, man, you okay?

660
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:52,081


661
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:52,481
Look, I'll be the first to tell you

662
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:56,686
That this little crusade of
yours is nuts, but...

663
00:34:57,254 --> 00:34:59,788
I do know a little something
about missing fathers.

664
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:01,957
What do you mean?

665
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:04,360
I mean there were times
when I was looking for my dad

666
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:07,797
When... all logic said that he was dead.

667
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:12,738
But I knew, in my heart...

668
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:14,337
That he was still alive.

669
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,874
Who cares what some
ninja turtle says, Cass?

670
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,743
what do you believe?

671
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:25,815
I believe he's out there.

672
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:26,849
Good.

673
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,551
Then go find him.

674
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:34,623
what about you?

675
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:36,392
what about me?

676
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:40,529
I don't know.

677
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,164
Honestly?

678
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:43,733
I'm good.

679
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,836
I can't believe I'm saying that, but I am.

680
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:49,905
I'm... I'm really good.

681
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:52,441
Even without your brother?

682
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:56,879
especially without my brother.

683
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,749
I mean, I spent so much time

684
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:01,917
Worrying about
the son of a bitch.

685
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:05,153
I mean, I've had more fun
with you in the past 24 hours

686
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:08,023
Than I've had with, Sam in years.

687
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:09,525
And you're not that much fun.

688
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:14,563
It's funny.

689
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,433
You know, I've been so
chained to my family.

690
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:21,069
But now that I'm alone...

691
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,138
Hell, I'm happy.

692
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:56,269
So...

693
00:36:56,337 --> 00:36:57,671
This is your life now?

694
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:03,076
You think you can
just live forever

695
00:37:03,144 --> 00:37:05,245
With your head
buried in the sand?

696
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:13,219
I love you, Jess.

697
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:19,092


698
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,762
God knows how much I miss you, too.

699
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:26,433
But you're wrong.

700
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:28,669
people can change.

701
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:30,937
There is reason for hope.

702
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,510
No, Sam.

703
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:38,945
There isn't.

704
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:49,087
How can you be so sure?

705
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,756
Because you freed me.

706
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:59,330
That's right.

707
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:03,234
You know who I am.

708
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,504
Lucifer.

709
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:09,640
You are a hard one to find, Sam.

710
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:12,043
Harder than most humans.

711
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:16,013
I don't suppose you'll
tell me where you are?

712
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:17,781
What do you want with me?

713
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:21,819
Thanks to you, I walk the earth.

714
00:38:21,886 --> 00:38:24,755
I want to give you a gift.

715
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:26,257
I want to give you everything.

716
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:27,725
I don't want anything from you.

717
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,932
I'm so sorry, Sam. I-I really am.

718
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:39,069
But, Nick here is just an improvisation.

719
00:38:39,137 --> 00:38:41,105
Plan "B."

720
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:44,475
He can barely contain me without
spontaneously combusting.

721
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:45,743
What are you talking about?

722
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,980
Why do you think
you were in that chapel?

723
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,185
You're the one, Sam.

724
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:57,755
You're my vessel.

725
00:38:57,822 --> 00:39:00,057
My true vessel.

726
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:02,827
No.

727
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:05,797
Yes.

728
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,800
No.

729
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,602
That'll never happen.

730
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,004
I'm sorry, but it will.

731
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:15,473
I will find you.

732
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,876
And when I do...

733
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:20,011
you will let me in.

734
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,780
I'm sure of it.

735
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:24,082
You need my consent?

736
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:26,718
Of course. I'm an angel.

737
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:28,219


738
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:32,457
I will kill myself
before letting you in.

739
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:34,092
And I'll just bring you back.

740
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,227


741
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:38,697


742
00:39:38,764 --> 00:39:41,466
Sam.

743
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:44,302
My heart breaks for you.

744
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,839
The weight on your shoulders.

745
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,507
What you've done.

746
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:53,111
What you still have to do.

747
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:56,014
It is more than anyone could bear.

748
00:39:56,082 --> 00:39:58,583
If there was some other way...

749
00:39:58,651 --> 00:39:59,918
But there isn't.

750
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:05,690
I will never lie to you.

751
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:08,192
I will never trick you.

752
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,061
but you will say yes to me.

753
00:40:10,129 --> 00:40:11,863
You're wrong.

754
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:12,930
I'm not.

755
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:18,536
I think I know you better
than you know yourself.

756
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:23,675
Why me?

757
00:40:23,743 --> 00:40:26,577
Because it had to be you, Sam.

758
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:32,651
It always had to be you.

759
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:38,322
