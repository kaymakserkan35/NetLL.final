1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,303
the road so far

2
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,422
let me guess - you're
offering up your own soul?

3
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:21,924
all you got to do
is bring sam back.

4
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:23,925
how long do you get?
one year.

5
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:27,229
let dean out of his deal right
now. i got a boss, like everybody.

6
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:28,631
who holds the contract?

7
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:30,232
i can't tell you.

8
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,637
there's a new leader
rising in the west

9
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,138
who doesn't like you
very much.

10
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:36,840
her name is lilith.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,243
i know about your deal,
dean. who told you that?

12
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:42,146
the demon that holds it.
she holds mine, too.

13
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:43,947
she?
her name's lilith.

14
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:48,553
dean:
so, this is ruby, huh?

15
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:49,453
she's a demon, sam.

16
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:51,656
they want us dead.
we want them dead.

17
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:52,957
sam: what kind of blade
could kill a demon?

18
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:54,959
bobby: yesterday, i'd have said
there was no such thing.

19
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,262
yellow eyes had some
pretty big plans for you, sam.

20
00:00:57,262 --> 00:01:00,165
you're specialn that
e.s.p.- vision kind of way.

21
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:02,166
no, that stuff's
not happening anymore.

22
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,871
black dogs? they're seeing
hellhounds - demonic pit bulls.

23
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:13,279
there's no way of saving me
from the pit, is there? no.

24
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,881
i don't want to die.

25
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:17,484
i don't want to go to hell.
we'll find a way to save you.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,203
you're gonna die! this is
what you're gonna become!

27
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:39,407
now..

28
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,972
dig up anything good?

29
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:43,876
no.
nothing good.

30
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:45,678
well, bobby has, finally.

31
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:46,779
yeah?
yeah.

32
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,581
a way to find lilith.

33
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:53,287
wow. with just, uh,
30 hours to go.

34
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:57,291
hey, why don't we just make
a t.j. run, you know?

35
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,794
some señoritas, cervezas?

36
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:02,697
we could - what's spanish
for "donkey show"?

37
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:06,300
so, if we do save you...

38
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,703
let's never do that.

39
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,208
hey, hey, dean...

40
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,209
uh...

41
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:20,416
look, we're cutting it close,
i know.

42
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,219
but we're gonna
get this done.

43
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,222
i don't care
what it takes, dean.

44
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,825
you're not gonna
go to hell.

45
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,028
i'm not gonna let you.

46
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:36,032
i swr.

47
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,835
everything's gonna be okay.

48
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,449
yeah, okay.

no reast for the wicked.

53
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,065
so, you got a name?

54
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:08,267
that's the whole kit
and caboodle.

55
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:10,869
with the right name,
the right ritual,

56
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,672
ain't nothing
you can't suss out.

57
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,274
like the town
lilith's in?

58
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:18,378
kid, when i get done,
we'll know the street.

59
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:37,198
new harmony, indiana.

60
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:38,500
and we have a winner.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,301
all right. let's go.

62
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,503
dean: whoa. whoa. whoa.
hold on.

63
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:43,305
just holster it up,
there, tex.

64
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:44,806
what's the problem?
"what's the problem"?

65
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:46,408
come on, where do i begin?

66
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:46,909
i mean, first of all,

67
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,111
we don't even know if lilith
actually holds my deal.

68
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:51,013
we're going off
of bela's intel?

69
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:54,316
now, when that bitch breathes,
the air comes out crooked, okay?

70
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,219
second, even if we could get to
lilith, we have no way to gank her.

71
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,123
and third, isn't this the same lilith
that wants your giant head on a pike?

72
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:01,424
should i continue?

73
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:03,326
ain't you just bringing
down the room?

74
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:04,528
well, it's a gift.
i'm sorry.

75
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:05,629
so, then, what are we
supposed to do, dean?

76
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,631
well, just 'cause i got to die
doesn't mean you have to, okay?

77
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:09,734
either we go in smart or we
don't go in at all. okay, fine.

78
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,435
that's the case,
i have the answer.

79
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:12,336
you do?
yeah.

80
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:14,238
a surefire wayto confir

81
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:17,341
and a way to get us
a bona fide demon-killing ginsu.

82
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,843
damn it, sam, no.

83
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:21,146
we are so past arguing.

84
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:22,447
dean, i am summoning ruby.

85
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,449
the hell you are!
we got enough problems as it is.

86
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,053
exactly. and we got no time
and no choice, either.

87
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:30,956
come on, man, she is the miss
universe of lying skanks, okay?

88
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,559
she told you that she could
save me, huh? lie!

89
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,160
she seems to know
everything about lilith

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,663
but forgot to mention - oh,
right - lilith owns my soul!

91
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,866
okay, fine, she's a liar.
she's still got that knife.

92
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,267
dean? for all we know,
she works for lilith.

93
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,970
then give me another option, dean. i
mean, tell me what else. sam's right.

94
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,372
no! damn it!

95
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:51,778
just no.

96
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,083
we are not gonna make the same
mistakes all over again.

97
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,890
you guys want to save me,
find something else.

98
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:14,503
where you going, bobby?

99
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:16,706
i guess to...

100
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:19,809
find something else.

101
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:43,934
ad constringendum,

102
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:49,240
ad ligandum eos pariter
et solvendum.

103
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:03,055
et ad congregantum eos coram me.

104
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,078
you know,
phones work, too.

105
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,681
hey, sam.

106
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:27,681
how's tricks?

107
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,083
how do you get around
so fast?

108
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:31,285
i got
the super bowl jetpack.

109
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:33,988
so...

110
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,691
you called?

111
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,293
did you know?

112
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:40,395
i'm gonna need
a tiny bit more.

113
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:44,200
about dean's deal -
that lilith holds the contract.

114
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,901
yes. i did.

115
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:50,806
and, what, you didn't think
that was important?

116
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:52,308
you weren't ready.
for what?

117
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:55,112
if i told you,
you two yahoos

118
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:57,213
would have just charged
after her half-cocked,

119
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,815
and lilith would have
peeled the meat

120
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,918
from your pretty,
pretty faces.

121
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:02,719
well, we're ready now.

122
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:05,522
i want your knife.

123
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,727
you're right
about one thing.

124
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,830
<i>you are ready.</i>

125
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:18,035
and now's the time, too -
lilith's guard's down.

126
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:19,537
is that so?

127
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:23,141
she's on shore leave,
a little r&r.

128
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:24,042
what the hell
does that mean?

129
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:26,144
trust me -
you don't want to know.

130
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:29,748
you didn't lose
those hex bags i gave you?

131
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:33,052
we got 'em. good. then she
won't sense that you're coming.

132
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:36,055
so, you'll give us
the knife?

133
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:37,256
no.

134
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:39,459
but you just said..

135
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:42,162
you want to charging with one little pissed sicker?

136
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:44,263
it's a waste
of a true-blue window,

137
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:46,666
like hitting h ???

138
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:48,168
okay, then how?

139
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:52,472
i know how to save
your brother, sam.

140
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:53,874
no, you don't!

141
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:54,975
you told dean you couldn't.

142
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,678
you've been lying to me
all along!

143
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:58,679
so, just give me
your damn knife!

144
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,181
you're not the one
that i've been lying to.

145
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,083
oh, so you can save him?
no.

146
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:04,585
<i>but you can.</i>

147
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,888
what?

148
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:10,893
sam, you've got
some god-given talent.

149
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:14,697
<i>well, not god given,
but you get the gist.</i>

150
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:16,599
all that psychic crap?

151
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,502
that's gone ever since
yellow eyes died.

152
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:21,003
not gone.

153
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:22,205
dormant.

154
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,007
and not just visions,
either.

155
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,810
why do you think lilith
is so scared of you?

156
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:29,813
right, she's scared of me.

157
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:32,716
if you wanted, you could wipe her
off the map without moving a muscle.

158
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,318
i don't believe you.
it's the truth.

159
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:36,620
and you decided
to tell me this just now?

160
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:38,822
um... demon.

161
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:41,826
"manipulative" is kind of
in the job description.

162
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,229
the fact is, is that you never
would have considered it,

163
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:47,432
not until you were -
desperate enough?

164
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,337
you don't like
being different.

165
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:56,041
you hate the way dean
looks at you sometimes,

166
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:58,344
like you're some sort
of sideshow freak.

167
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:02,248
but suck it up because we got
a lot of ground to cover,

168
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,349
and we got to do it fast.

169
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,151
<i>but we can do it.</i>

170
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:09,156
look, call me a bitch,
hate me all you want,

171
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:11,859
but i have never lied
to you, sam.

172
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:13,760
not ever.

173
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,762
and i'm telling you -

174
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:18,966
you can save your brother.

175
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,168
and i can show you how.

176
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:22,970
dean:
so, that's you, huh?

177
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,772
our slutty little yoda.

178
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:26,474
dean.

179
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:29,678
charming as ever.

180
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:31,579
oh, i knew you'd show up...

181
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,082
'cause i knew
sam wouldn't listen!

182
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:37,085
but you're not gonna
teach him anything.

183
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:39,388
you understand me?
over my dead body.

184
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,590
oh. well, you're right
about that.

185
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,793
what you are gonna do
is give me that knife.

186
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:47,296
then you can go crawl back
into whatever slop you came from

187
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,898
and never bother me
or my brother again.

188
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,399
are we clear?

189
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,400
your brother is carrying
a bomb inside of him,

190
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,203
and we'd be stupid
not to use it.

191
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:54,103
dean, look,
just hold on -

192
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,406
sam, don't. come on, man.
what are you, blind?

193
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,807
can't you see
that this is a trick?

194
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:59,309
that's not true.
she wants you to give in

195
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,912
to this whole demonic,
psychic whatever, okay?

196
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:02,813
hell, she probably
wants you to become

197
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,815
her little
"antichrist superstar."

198
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:06,818
i want lilith dead.

199
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:08,719
that's all.
why?

200
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:09,821
i've told you why.

201
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:10,622
oh, right, yeah.

202
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:12,323
because you were
human once,

203
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,625
and you liked kittens
and long walks on the beach.

204
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:17,529
you know, i am so sick
of proving myself to you.

205
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:19,631
you want to save yourself,
this is how,

206
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:22,034
you dumb, spineless dick!

207
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:32,444
whoa! ruby, hey!

208
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,869
what the hell
are you grinning at?

209
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,372
missing something?

210
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:01,776
i'll kill you,
you son of a bitch.

211
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,991
like i said...

212
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,193
i knew you'd come.

213
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:20,296
wait!

214
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:22,299
you're just gonna
leave me here?

215
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,800
let's go, sam.

216
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,704
oh, so, you're just too stupid
to live, is that it?

217
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:30,707
then fine.
you deserve hell.

218
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:32,209
i wish i could be there,
dean.

219
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:35,813
i wish i could smell the flesh
sizzle off your bones!

220
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:38,416
i wish i could be there
to hear you scream!

221
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,218
and i wish you'd
shut your piehole,

222
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:42,119
but we don't always
get what we want.

223
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:01,541
what, you gonna let ruby
rot down there?

224
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:03,143
that's the idea.

225
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:06,346
dean, what if, uh...

226
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:09,850
what if ruby's right?

227
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,653
<i>what if i can
take out lilith?</i>

228
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:17,357
quit looking at me
likehat.

229
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:19,760
what, are you gonna give her the
"carrie" stare, and lilith goes poof?

230
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,362
i don't know
what ruby meant.

231
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:23,665
you know, maybe we should
just go ask her.

232
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:25,466
sam, you wanted the knife.
i got you the knife.

233
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:26,668
dean, just listen to me
for a second.

234
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:28,970
last time,
lilith snapped her fingers

235
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,973
and put 30 demons on our ass,
and all we got's one little knife?

236
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:35,277
i mean, like you said, we go in smart or we
don't go in at all. well, this ain't smart.

237
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:37,679
we got one shot at this, dean -
just one.

238
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,481
so, if there's
a surefire way,

239
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,484
they maybe we should
just talk about it.

240
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:44,887
sam, we are not gonna make
the same mistake all over again.

241
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:46,388
you said that,
but what does that even mean?

242
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:48,191
don't you see
a pattern here?

243
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:50,694
dad's deal,
my deal, now this?

244
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:55,098
???

245
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:56,900
that's all ???

246
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,303
ruby's just jerking your chain
down the road.

247
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:02,406
you know what's it's paved with,
and you know where it's going.

248
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:05,810
dean.

249
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,916
what are you afraid's
gonna happen?

250
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:15,320
this is me.
i can handle it.

251
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,822
and if it'll save you -

252
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,123
why even risk it?

253
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,427
because you're my brother.

254
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,431
and because you did
the same thing for me.

255
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,034
oh, i know.

256
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,037
and look how that
turned out.

257
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,241
all i'm saying...

258
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,248
sammy, all i'm saying is
that you're my weak spot.

259
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,350
you are.

260
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,253
and i'm yours.

261
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,558
you don't mean that.
we're - we're family.

262
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,260
i know.

263
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,662
and those evil sons
of bitches know it, too.

264
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:59,268
i mean, what we'll do for each
other, you know, how far we'll go -

265
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:00,569
they're using that
against us.

266
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,571
so, what, we just stop
looking out for each other?

267
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:05,074
no, we stop
being martyrs, man.

268
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:08,077
we stop spreading it
for these demons.

269
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:10,779
we take this knife,

270
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,684
and we go after lilith our way,
the way dad taught us to.

271
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:18,988
and if we go down,
then, uh...

272
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,091
then we go down swinging.

273
00:15:25,396 --> 00:15:26,897
what do you think?

274
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,304
i think you totally
should have been jamming

275
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,606
"eye of the tiger"
right there.

276
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,207
oh, bite me.

277
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:39,310
i totally rehearsed
that speech, too.

278
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:43,415
so i need?

279
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:45,417
yeah. we???

280
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,919
yeah. i guess.

281
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:50,322
tell me something -

282
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:53,225
what the hell does
a demon do for fun?

283
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,341
hey, pat.
- tom.

284
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,943
how's that granddaughter
of yours?

285
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,645
homesick, poor thing.

286
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,547
darn bug
that's going around now.

287
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:14,949
oh, that's too bad.

288
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:17,251
well, you give her
a big old hug from me and judy.

289
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,053
you bet.
take her easy, tom.

290
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:20,855
you too, pat.

291
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,168
help us

292
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,177
where is she?

293
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:43,279
upstairs.
playing with freckles.

294
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,282
we just sit here,
we're dead.

295
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,984
she'll hear you.
it's her or us.

296
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:49,586
's my baby girl.

297
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:50,987
not anymore.

298
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,391
there's something
inside her.

299
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,393
shut your mouth.

300
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:56,894
she's coming.

301
00:16:57,694 --> 00:16:59,397
what were you guys
talking about?

302
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:01,299
just how much
we love you.

303
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,701
what - w-what happened
to your dress?

304
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:05,703
oh, freckles
was mean to me.

305
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:10,409
that's -
that's nice, dear.

306
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,212
daddy, will you push me
on the swing?

307
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:16,315
sure... honey...

308
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:20,019
but don't you want
to change first?

309
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,622
you don't want
the neighbors to see...

310
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:24,924
all that blood.

311
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:27,627
oh, you're so smart.
i love you, daddy.

312
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,331
uh, i love you, too.

313
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,234
hey, sweetie...

314
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:37,437
u think
maybe after a while,

315
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:39,440
do you think
maybe you could...

316
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,744
...let us go?

317
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:48,249
why?

318
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,151
i, uh...

319
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:53,254
well, i don't know.

320
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:55,156
don't you want to be here?

321
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,560
don't you love me?

322
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,062
well, sure i do.

323
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:03,165
we all do, honey.
we all love you so much.

324
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,766
don't be mean
to me, daddy,

325
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,068
like freckles
or what's her name,

326
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:07,870
that mean old babysitter.

327
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,376
i- i'm sorry.

328
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:18,281
that's okay, silly!

329
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:19,984
now let's go and play.

330
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:30,895
where do you think
you're going?

331
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:41,907
we got the knife.

332
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,510
and you intend to use it
without me?

333
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,613
do i look like
a ditchable prom date to you?

334
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:49,015
no, bobby, of course not.

335
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:52,018
this is about me
and sam, okay?

336
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:52,919
this isn't your fight.

337
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,821
the hell it isn't!

338
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:58,325
family don't end
with blood, boy.

339
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:04,331
besides, you need me.

340
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,334
bobby -
you're playing wounded.

341
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:11,738
tell me, how many hallucinations
have you had so far?

342
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:16,344
how'd you know?

343
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:19,747
because that's what happens when
you got hellhounds on your butt,

344
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:21,249
and because i'm smart.

345
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:29,859
i'll follow.

346
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:37,366
don't be stopping to pee
every 10 minutes, either.

347
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,578
sam: hey, dean?

348
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,979
yeah?

349
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,084
you know, if this doesn't -

350
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:56,087
if this doesn't go the way we
want, i want you to know that -

351
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:57,288
no. no, no,
no, no, no.

352
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:57,888
"no" what?

353
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,993
you're not gonna bust out
the misty goodbye speech, okay?

354
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,496
i mean, if this is
my last day on earth,

355
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:07,399
i do not want it to be
socially awkward.

356
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:13,005
you know what i do want?

357
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,510
bon jovi?

358
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,413
bon jovi rocks...
on occasion.

359
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:26,419
* and i walk these streets! *

00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:30,123

* i play for keeps! *

362
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:35,829
* 'cause i might not make it back! *

363
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:39,233
* i've been everywhere! *
* oh, yeah *

364
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:42,637
* but i'm standing tall! *

365
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:45,340
* i've seen a million faces *

366
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,943
* and i've rocked 'em all *

367
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:50,946
* 'cause i'm a cowboy *

368
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:55,050
* on a steel horse, i ride *

369
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,652
* i'm wanted *

370
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:58,554
* wanted! *

00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:14,271
* dead or alive *

372
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:17,574
* dead or alive

373
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:21,578
* dead or ali-i-ve

374
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,494
we getting pulled over?

375
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,897
i got a busted taillight.

376
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,900
it's not like we're
in a hurry or nothin'.

377
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,415
problem, officer?

378
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,116
license and registration,
please.

379
00:21:57,116 --> 00:22:00,821
did you realize you have
a taillight out, mr... hagar?

380
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,425
yes. yes, sir.

381
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,329
uh, you know, i've been
meaning to take care of that.

382
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,931
as a matter of fact...

383
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:13,634
dean!

384
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:28,150
what the hell happened?

385
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,752
dean just killed a demon.

386
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:31,353
how'd you know?

387
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:33,956
i just knew.

388
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:38,562
i could see its face,
its real face under that one.

389
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:50,975
so, what, now you're
seeing demons?

390
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:54,178
i've been seeing all kinds of
things lately, but nothing like this.

391
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:56,281
actually, it's not
all that crazy.

392
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,582
how is it not that crazy?

393
00:22:57,582 --> 00:23:00,185
well, you got just
over five hours to go?

394
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:03,788
you're piercing the veil, dean,
glimpsing the "b" side.

395
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,593
little less new agey,
please.

396
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,294
you're almost hell's bitch,

397
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:12,097
so you can see
hell's other bitches.

398
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:13,099
thank you.

399
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,800
it'll actually come in
pretty handy.

400
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,104
oh, well, i'm glad my doomed soul's
good for something. damn right it is.

401
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:21,007
lilith's probably got
demons stashed all over town.

402
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,709
we can't let 'em
sound the alarm.

403
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,812
if she knows we're here,
we're dead before we started.

404
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:26,413
wow, this is
a terrific plan.

405
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:27,815
i'm excited to be
a part of it.

406
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,216
can we go, please?

407
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,128
woman:
happy birthday, sweetie.

408
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:42,130
both: happy birthday!

409
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,632
yay, it's my birthday
every day!

410
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,443
cake... again.

411
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:56,245
it's good.

412
00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:59,148
hey, grandpa,
can i ask you something?

413
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:00,850
sure, jelly bean, anything.

414
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,253
why'd you try to go
to mr. wepram for help?

415
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:08,358
uh, well, i didn't.
i don't know what you mean.

416
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:09,759
you're a big, fat liar.

417
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:12,763
i'm sorry.
it was a mistake.

418
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:14,365
did you two
know about this?

419
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:21,172
no.

420
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:25,977
no.

421
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,382
grandpa,
you don't love me?

422
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:33,785
i do. i do.
i love you.

423
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:36,488
no. you don't.
you're lying again.

424
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,791
you're just
a mean, old man.

425
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,394
do something.

426
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,596
help me, please.

427
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,397
i don't think
i like you anymore.

428
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:50,303
nobody scream, okay?

429
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:52,606
screaming makes me mad.

430
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,718
mommy, can i have
ice cream with mine?

431
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:10,024
dean:
it's the little girl.

432
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:12,727
god, h face
is awful.

433
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:15,430
all right, then let's go.
we're wasting time.

434
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,732
wait!
for what?

435
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:18,734
for her to kill
the rest of them?

436
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,535
yeah, and us too
if we're not careful.

437
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,837
look.

438
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:25,141
see the real go-getter mailman
on the clock at 9:00 p.m.?

439
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:27,944
and mr. rogers
over there.

440
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,747
bobby: demons?
yes.

441
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:33,950
okay, fine, we ninja past
those guys, sneak in.

442
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,952
and, what, give a columbian
necktie to a 10-year-old girl?

443
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,053
come on. look, dean, i know it's awful.

444
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:39,256
you think?
this isn't just about
saving you, dean.

445
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:41,559
this is about
saving everybody.

446
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,362
she's got to
be stopped, son.

447
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:50,068
oh, damn it.

448
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:51,869
girl:
read it again, mommy.

449
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,772
but i've read it 26 times.

450
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:56,274
again.

451
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:00,879
"once upon a time

452
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,382
"in the town of celine

453
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,685
"lived a beautiful princess
named cleo.

454
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:10,088
"but the town was plagued
with an evil dragon

455
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,593
"that demanded
the blood of the children.

456
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:16,696
"and the princess was doomed
to be sacrificed

457
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:18,798
to the dark
and terrible dragon."

exorcizo te, creatura aquae,

in nomine del
patris onmipotentis.

460
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:29,474
i'd like
my knife back, please.

461
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:31,576
or your neck snaps
like a chicken bone.

462
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:33,679
he doesn't have it. take it easy.

463
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:37,382
how the hell
did you get out?

464
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:39,985
what you don't know about me
could fill a book.

465
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:41,787
oh.

466
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:43,088
what?

467
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:46,993
nothing. i just couldn't see you before,

468
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:49,396
but you are one ugly broad.

469
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:53,500
sam, give me the knife
before you hurt yourself.

470
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,902
you'll get it
when this is over.

471
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:56,403
it's already over.

472
00:27:57,504 --> 00:27:58,706
i gave you a way
to save dean.

473
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:00,407
you shot me down.
now it's too late.

474
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:02,410
he's dead.

475
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,712
and i'm not gonna
let you die, too.

476
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:08,016
try and stop me,
and i'll kill you, bitch.

477
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:09,518
hit me with
your best shot, baby.

478
00:28:09,518 --> 00:28:10,619
guys, guys!

479
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:11,319
hey.

480
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:13,922
have your little
catfight later.

481
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,731
so much for the element
of surprise.

482
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:23,632
let's go.
go. run. run!

483
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:32,843
what the hell's
taking bobby?

484
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,846
dean: sam!
i'm trying!

485
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,165
you think lilith
knows we're here?

486
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,266
probably.

487
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,987
shh! shh! shh!
shh! shh!

488
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,888
we're here to help, okay?

489
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,290
i'm gonna move my hand,

490
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,593
and we're gonna talk
nice and quiet, okay?

491
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:23,097
sam: sir, where
is your daughter?

492
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:27,101
it's not -
it's not her anymore.

493
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:28,202
where is she?

494
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:31,306
upstairs in her bedroom.

495
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:32,907
dean: okay, okay, okay,
listen to me.

496
00:29:32,907 --> 00:29:34,709
i want you to go downstairs
to the basement,

497
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,510
put a line of salt
at the door behind you.

498
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,313
do you understand me?
not without my wife.

499
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:40,115
yes, without your wife.
no, not -

500
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,321
do it!

501
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:30,234
do it!

502
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:34,738
do it!

503
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,541
do it!

504
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:38,542
hurry!

505
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:41,746
wait. wait.
it's not her!

506
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,049
it's not
in the girl anymore!

507
00:31:57,963 --> 00:31:58,965
damn it.

508
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:01,667
all right,
no matter what you hear,

509
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:04,269
you, your husband, and your
daughter stay in the basement.

510
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,173
well, i hate to be
a told-you-so.

511
00:32:07,173 --> 00:32:08,575
all right, ruby,
where is she?

512
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:09,375
i don't know.

513
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:11,878
could she get past
the sprinklers?

514
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:14,281
her pay grade, she ain't
sweating the holy water.

515
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,383
okay. you win.
what do i have to do?

516
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:19,787
what do you mean?
to save dean.

517
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:20,988
what do you
need me to do?

518
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,089
what the hell do you
think you're doing?

519
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:23,991
just shut up for a second.
ruby!

520
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:25,293
you had your chance.

521
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:28,997
you can't just flip a switch.
we needed time.

522
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,598
well, there's got to be something.
there's got to be some way.

523
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:32,100
whatever it is -
i'll do it.

524
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,703
don't - dean! i'm not gonna
let you go to hell, dean!

525
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,804
yes, you are!

526
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:39,808
yes, you are.

527
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,812
i'm sorry.

528
00:32:42,812 --> 00:32:44,613
i mean,
this is all my fault.

529
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:46,115
i know that.

530
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:50,820
but what you're doing,
it's not gonna save me.

531
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:53,923
it's only gonna kill you.

532
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,426
then what am i
supposed to do?

533
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:01,431
keep fighting.

534
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:06,437
and take care
of my wheels.

535
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,744
sam, remember what
dad taught you...

536
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:14,746
okay?

537
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:18,450
and remember
what i taught you.

538
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:49,182
ruby:
i'm sorry, dean.

539
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:53,888
i wouldn't wish this
upon my worst enemy.

540
00:34:02,197 --> 00:34:03,398
hellhound.

541
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:04,299
where?

542
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:06,802
there.

543
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,535
give me the knife.
maybe i can fight it off.

544
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:39,837
what?
come on!

545
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:41,438
that dust won't
last forever.

546
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:45,644
wait.

547
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:48,747
you want to die?

548
00:34:48,747 --> 00:34:51,350
sam, that's not ruby.
it's not ruby!

549
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,660
how long you been in her?

550
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:02,962
not long...

551
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:05,265
but i like it.

552
00:35:05,265 --> 00:35:07,366
it's all grown-up
and pretty.

553
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:11,872
and where's ruby?

554
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:17,978
she was a very bad girl,
so i sent her far, far away.

555
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:19,780
you know, i should have
seen it before.

556
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:22,182
but you all
look alike to me.

557
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,291
hello, sam.

558
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:35,397
i've wanted to meet you
for a very long time.

559
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,707
your lips are soft.

560
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:48,612
all right,
so you have me.

561
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,013
let my brother go.

562
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,017
silly goose.

563
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:57,621
you want to bargain, you have
to have something that i want.

564
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:01,225
you don't.

565
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:03,828
so, is this
your big plan, huh?

566
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,631
drag me to hell, kill sam,
and then what -

567
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,234
become queen bitch?

568
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,535
i don't have to answer
to puppy chow.

569
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,246
sic him, boy.

570
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:30,156

571
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,562

572
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,370
no. stop it.

573
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:44,872
stop it!

574
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:46,574

575
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:49,176

576
00:37:21,912 --> 00:37:22,913

577
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:26,416
i said, back.

578
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:32,322
i don't think so.

579
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:03,856
no.

580
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,162

00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:23,778

584
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,391

585
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:40,096
