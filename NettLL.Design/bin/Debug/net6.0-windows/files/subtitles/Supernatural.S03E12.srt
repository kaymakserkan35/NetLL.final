1
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:15,427
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing.

2
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,168
Are you sure this is bela's room?

3
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:20,530
I'd say so.

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,500
Dean?

5
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,399
Sweetie, are you there?

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,599
Where are you?

7
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,300
Two states away by now.

8
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,761
- Where?
- Where's our usual quippy banter? I miss it.

9
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,545
I want it back, bela... now.

10
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:50,016
Your little pistol, you mean?
Sorry. I can't at the moment.

11
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:52,234
You understand how many
people are gonna die if you do this?

12
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,620
What exactly is it that
you think i plan to do with it?

13
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:58,959
Take the only weapon we have against an
army of demons and sell it to the highest bidder.

14
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:02,538
- You know nothing about me.
- I know i'm gonna stop you.

15
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,799
Tough words for a guy
who can't even find me.

16
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,213
Oh, i'll find you, sweetheart.
You know why?

17
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,900
Because i have absolutely
nothing better to do

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,996
- Than to track you down.
- That's where you're wrong.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,299
You're about to be quite occupied.

20
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:18,362
Did you really think
i wouldn't take precautions?

21
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,000
Hands in the air!

22
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:29,732
- That bitch!
- Turn around! Now!

23
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,466
Sam and dean winchester, you
have the right to remain silent.

24
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:37,510
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

25
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:41,741
You have the right to speak to an attorney and
have an attorney present during any questioning.

26
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:45,958
If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be
appointed for you at government expense.

27
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,200
Hi, guys.

28
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:50,793
It's been a while.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,793
Supernatural 312

30
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:10,492
- So, did you get them?
- Where is everyone? I asked for all your men.

31
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,751
And you got them.
They went with you on the raid.

32
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,299
Four men? That's all?

33
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,887
Everyone i could drum up
with an hour's notice.

34
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:19,443
We're a small town, agent henriksen.

35
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:30,584
- What's he in for?
- Drunk and disorderly.

36
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,100
Keys.

37
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,679
Now.

38
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:37,775
What are you doing?

39
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,099
It is your lucky night, sir.
You are free to go.

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,199
- What the hell are you doing?
- This way.

41
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,732
Agent henriksen, you can't
just release my prisoners.

42
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,999
Agent henriksen.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,687
- Look. I get it... you're may berry p.D.
- Excuse me?

44
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:57,827
And this isn't how i'd do it
if i had my choice,

45
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:00,599
But a tip's a tip,
and we had to move fast.

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,110
Look, agent, this ain't my first rodeo.

47
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,063
You've never been
to a rodeo like this before.

48
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,199
You have any idea who we're
about to bring in here?

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
Yeah... a couple of fugitives.

50
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,199
The most dangerous criminals you've
ever laid your eyeballs on.

51
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,256
Think hannibal lecter and his half-Wit little
brother. Do you know what these guys do for kicks?

52
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,399
Dig up graves and mutilate corpses. They're not just killers,
sheriff. They're satan-Worshipping, nutbag killers.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,515
So work with me here. I'll get them out your hair
and on their way to supermax,

54
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,177
And you'll be home
in enough time to watch the farm report.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
However we can help.

56
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,300
Those men of yours...
post them at the exits.

57
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,800
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,899
Reidy, bring them in.

59
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,500
I guess we're as ready
as we're gonna be.

60
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:07,300
Why all the sourpusses?

61
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,954
I'll show you to the cells.

62
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,995
Hey! Hey!
Watch the merchandise!

63
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,700
We're not the ones
you should be scared of, nancy.

64
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,400
Dean, come on!

65
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,199
All right.
All right.

66
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,790
- Sit?
- Yeah.

67
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,499
How we gonna
houdini out of this one?

68
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,280
Good question.

69
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,430
It's me.
Steven in?

70
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:03,645
Well, get him
out of the meeting.

71
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:12,904
- Groves.
- I got them.

72
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,098
Well, i'll be damned.

73
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:19,024
I was betting on your headstone reading
"couldn't catch the winchester boys."

74
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,599
- Well, they'll be at supermax by morning.
- How?

75
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,347
Armored bus, loaded with men.

76
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,499
A bus? What, are you trying
to give me another ulcer?

77
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,593
- Look, we're taking every precaution.
- Like the last time? And the time before that?

78
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:31,706
Screw that.
I'm sending a chopper.

79
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:35,010
- Whatever you think is best.
- Damn right. And i'll be on it.

80
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:40,147
I can't take you losing those boys again. They
have been a primary thorn in my ass for months.

81
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:41,299
- So, victor...
- Yeah?

82
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,000
Glue your eyeballs to them
till i get there.

83
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,899
- There's a chopper on its way.
- But we don't have a helicopter pad.

84
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,500
Then clear
the damn parking lot.

85
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,685
You know
what i'm trying to decide?

86
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:09,988
I don't know. What? Whether cialis will
help you with your little condition?

87
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:12,400
What to have for dinner
tonight.

88
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,699
Steak or lobster. What the hell.

89
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,399
Surf and turf.

90
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,288
I got a lot to celebrate. I mean, after all,
seeing you two in chains...

91
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,099
You kinky son of a bitch.
We don't swing that way.

92
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,700
Now, that's funny.

93
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:30,378
You know, i wouldn't bust out
the melted butter just yet.

94
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,199
Couldn't catch us
at the bank.

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,800
Couldn't keep us in that jail.

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,699
You're right. Screwed up.
I underestimated you.

97
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,479
I didn't count on you
being that smart. But now i'm ready.

98
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,499
- Yeah, ready to lose us again?
- Ready like a court order to keep you

99
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,899
In a supermaximum prison in nevada till trial. Ready
like isolation in a soundproof, windowless cell

100
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,799
So small that, between you and me...

101
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,363
Probably unconstitutional.

102
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,780
How's that for ready?

103
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:04,101
Take a good look at sam.

104
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:06,500
You two will never
see each other again.

105
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,948
Where's that smug smile, dean?

106
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,676
I want to see it.

107
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,039
- You got the wrong guys.
- Oh, yeah. I forgot. You fight monsters.

108
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:23,699
Sorry, dean. Truth is, your daddy brainwashed
you with all that devil talk

109
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,243
And no doubt touched you in a bad place.

110
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:29,099
- That's all. That's reality.
- Why don't you shut your mouth?

111
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,699
Well, guess what. Life sucks. Get a helmet.
'Cause everybody's got a sob story,

112
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,786
But not everybody
becomes a killer.

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,981
And now i have two less
to worry about.

114
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,600
It's surf-And-Turf time.

115
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,299
Steven.

116
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,000
Gentlemen.

117
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:12,774
What's all this?

118
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:16,799
What can i say? The fbi
didn't invent bureaucracy. We perfected it.

119
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,199
- You want me to do all this now?
- Sorry. Now, victor.

120
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm gonna go take a good,
long gander at our fugitives.

121
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:48,447
Sam and dean winchester.

122
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:51,297
I'm deputy director steven groves.

123
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,874
This is a pleasure.

124
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,962
- Well, glad one of us feels that way.
- I've been waiting a long time

125
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,389
For you two to come out of the woodwork.

126
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:28,385
Sorry. Got to cut this short.
It's gonna be a long night, fellas.

127
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,600
What the hell
was that?

128
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:41,782
- Put the gun down!
- Wait. Okay, wait.

129
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,896
- He shot him!
- I didn't shoot him. I didn't shoot anyone.

130
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:45,899
- He shot me!
- Get on your knees now!

131
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,355
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't shoot. Please. Look. Here. Here.

132
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:55,760
We didn't shoot him. Check the body.
There's no blood. We did not kill him.

133
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,499
- Vic, there's no bullet wound.
- He's probably been dead for months.

134
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,620
- What did you do to him?
- We didn't do anything!

135
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:10,505
- Talk, or i shoot.
- You won't believe us.

136
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,394
He was possessed.

137
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,200
Possessed? Right.

138
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,812
Fire up the chopper.
We're taking them out of here now.

139
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:20,503
- Yeah. Do that.
- Bill?

140
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,791
Bill, are you there?

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,299
They're dead.
I think they're all dead.

142
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,094
What the hell was that? Reidy?

143
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:15,181
Reidy?!

144
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:17,656
Reidy?

145
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,609
What the hell was that?

146
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:36,225
- Hello?
- My men. Agent henriksen?

147
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:39,338
- What the hell's happening out there?
- I can't get a line. All the phones are out.

148
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,600
Henriksen!
Four of my men!

149
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,218
The internet, my cell... it's all dead.
How can it all be dead?

150
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,399
- That can't be good.
- Oh, my god.

151
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,801
No. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. We're
gonna go. We're gonna go... right now.

152
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:06,383
Nobody's going anywhere.
Everybody, calm down.

153
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:08,378
Your partner is out there!
My men are out there!

154
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:11,109
I know. We go out there,
we're asking to die, too.

155
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,853
- Don't you get it?
- Get what?

156
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,299
They're out there, and they're coming
in here. This is a siege.

157
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,599
So this might be a good time for you to
lock the doors and the windows, take a breath,

158
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,953
And maybe deal with this like trained
professionals with some sense in their heads.

159
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,634
You okay?

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,209
I wouldn't think so. Nancy, right?

161
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:46,099
I'm gonna get you through this.
You got my word.

162
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:47,930
You got that?

163
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,299
All right,
don't be such a wuss.

164
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,238
What's the plan?

165
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:58,000
Kill everyone in the station, bust you two out?

166
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,870
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your psycho friends.

167
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:02,759
I'm talking about a bloodbath.

168
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,711
Okay, i promise you, whoever's out
there is not here to help us.

169
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,099
Look, you got to believe us. Everyone here
is in terrible danger.

170
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,597
Why don't you let us out of here
so we can save your asses?

171
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:14,045
From what?

172
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,711
You gonna say "demons"?

173
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:20,334
Don't you dare say "demons."

174
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:22,451
Let me tell you something.

175
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:24,700
You should be
a lot more scared of me.

176
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,443
How's the shoulder?

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,807
It's awesome.

178
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,399
I'll live.

179
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,199
You know,
if we get out of here alive.

180
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,375
So, you got a plan?

181
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,887
Uh, please. Please. We need your
help. It's... it's nancy. Nancy, right?

182
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:59,020
Nancy, my... my brother's been shot.
He's... he's bleeding really bad.

183
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:03,421
You think maybe you could get us
a towel? Please? Just one clean towel?

184
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,990
Look. Look at us.
We're not the bad guys, i swear.

185
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,129
Nice try.

186
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,189
Thank you.

187
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,539
It's okay.

188
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Thank you.

189
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,900
Thanks.

190
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,000
Let her go!
Let her go!

191
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,900
You okay, nance?

192
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,304
Try something again,
get shot. And not in the arm.

193
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,308
What the hell was that?

194
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,199
We're like sitting ducks in here.

195
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,599
Yeah, i know.

196
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:28,606
Would it kill these cops
to bring us a snack?!

197
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,099
- How many you figure are out there?
- I don't know.

198
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,007
However many there are, they could be possessing
anyone. Anyone could just walk right in.

199
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,248
It's kind of wild, right?

200
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,677
I mean, it's like
they're coming right for us.

201
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:42,069
They've never done that before.

202
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,495
It's like we got
a contract on us.

203
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,099
Think it's because we're so awesome?

204
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,817
I think it's 'cause we're so awesome.

205
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:59,465
Well, howdy, there, sheriff.

206
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:08,432
- Uh, sheriff?
- It's time to go, boys.

207
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,587
Uh... you know what?

208
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:15,394
We're just comfy right here.
But thank you.

209
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,300
What do you think
you're doing?

210
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,462
We're not just gonna sit around here and
wait to die. We're gonna make a run for it.

211
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:23,568
- It's safer here.
- There's a swat facility in boulder.

212
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,562
- We're not going anywhere.
- The hell we're not.

213
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:38,300
Stay back!

214
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,664
- Hurry up!
- It's too late.

215
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:52,923
I already called them.
They're already coming.

216
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,500
Is he...

217
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,421
Is he dead?

218
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,710
Henriksen.

219
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:28,377
Hey.
Is that you in there?

220
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:43,959
I shot the sheriff.

221
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,530
But you didn't shoot the deputy.

222
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,853
Five minutes ago,
i was fine, and then...

223
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:58,699
Let me guess...
some nasty black smoke

224
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,167
Jammed itself down your throat?

225
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:05,068
You were possessed.

226
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,300
Possessed like...

227
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,699
Possessed.

228
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,466
That's what it feels like.
Now you know.

229
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:14,300
I owe you the biggest
"i told you so" ever.

230
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,500
Officer amici.

231
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,501
Keys.

232
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:38,731
All right.

233
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,928
So, how do we survive?

234
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:01,333
Well, that's nice.
It's not gonna do much good.

235
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:05,213
- We got an arsenal here.
- You don't poke a bear with a bb gun.

236
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:07,999
- That's just gonna make him mad.
- What do you need?

237
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,199
- Salt. Lots and lots of salt.
- Salt?

238
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,553
What, is there an echo in here?

239
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:14,899
There's road salt
in the storeroom.

240
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,496
Perfect.

241
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:19,808
Perfect. We need salt
at every window and every door.

242
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,200
How you holding up,
nancy?

243
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,006
Okay.

244
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:32,632
When i was little,

245
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:36,158
I would come home from church
and talk about the devil.

246
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,100
My parents would tell me
to stop being so literal.

247
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,500
I guess i showed them,
huh?

248
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,827
That should hold.

249
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,300
Thank you.

250
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,499
Hey, where's my car?

251
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,739
Impound lot out back.

252
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,297
Wait.

253
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,413
You're not
going out there?

254
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:03,553
Yeah. I got to get something
out of my trunk.

255
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,700
They're coming!

256
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:26,400
Hurry!

257
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,232
- Everybody okay?
- Define "okay."

258
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,802
All right, everybody needs
to put these on.

259
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,400
They'll keep you
from being possessed.

260
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,650
What about you and sam?

261
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,599
- Smart.
- How long you had those?

262
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,690
Not long enough.

263
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,240
Hey, that's jenna rubner.

264
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,899
It's not jenna anymore.

265
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,399
That's where all that
black demon smoke went?

266
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,152
Looks like.

267
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,002
Shotgun shells full of salt.

268
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:39,205
- Whatever works.
- Fighting off monsters with condiments.

269
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,744
So, turns out
demons are real.

270
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:48,000
F.Y.I...
ghosts are real, too.

271
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:52,499
So are werewolves,
vampires, changelings,

272
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,835
Evil clowns that eat people.

273
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,375
Okay, then.

274
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:59,851
If it makes you feel better,
bigfoot's a hoax.

275
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,539
It doesn't.

276
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,952
How many demons?

277
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:07,399
Total?

278
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,900
No clue.

279
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,939
A lot.

280
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,613
You know what my job is?

281
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,807
You mean besides
locking up the good guys?

282
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,925
I have no idea.

283
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,900
My job is boring.

284
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,428
It's frustrating.

285
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:26,899
You work three years for one break,

286
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,699
And then maybe you can save...
a few people. Maybe.

287
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:33,100
That's the payoff.

288
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,199
I've been busting my ass for 15 years

289
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,400
To nail a handful of guys,
and all this while,

290
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,600
There was something
off in the corner so big.

291
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,099
So, yeah.

292
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,699
Sign me up for that big, frosty
mug of wasting my damn life.

293
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,199
You didn't know.

294
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,900
Now i do.

295
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,480
What's out there?

296
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,650
Can you guys beat it?

297
00:25:56,904 --> 00:25:58,510
Can you win?

298
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:04,000
Honestly, i think
the world's gonna end bloody.

299
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,272
But it doesn't mean
we shouldn't fight.

300
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,199
We do have choices.

301
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,429
I choose to go down swingin'.

302
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,877
Plus, you got nothing
to go home to but your brother.

303
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,016
Yeah.

304
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:24,600
What about you? You rockin'
the white picket fence?

305
00:26:25,023 --> 00:26:27,803
Empty apartment,
string of angry ex-Wives.

306
00:26:28,396 --> 00:26:30,311
I'm right where you are.

307
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,501
Imagine that.

308
00:26:39,571 --> 00:26:41,399
- How do we kill her?
- We don't.

309
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,599
- She's a demon.
- She's here to help us.

310
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,521
Are you kidding?

311
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:52,226
Are you gonna let me out?

312
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,800
And they say chivalry's dead.

313
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:05,936
Does anyone have a breath mint?
Some guts splattered in my mouth

314
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:08,684
While i was killing my way in here.

315
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:24,499
- How many are out there?
- 30, at least. That's so far.

316
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,799
Oh, good. 30.
30 hit men, all gunning for us.

317
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,181
Who sent them?

318
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,299
You didn't tell dean?

319
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:35,199
I'm surprised.

320
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,599
- Tell me what?
- There's a big new up-And-Comer.

321
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,099
Real pied piper.

322
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,399
- Who is he?
- Not he.

323
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,098
Her.

324
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:46,199
- Her name is lilith.
- Lilith?

325
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,799
And she really, really wants
sam's intestines on a stick.

326
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,599
'Cause she sees him as competition.

327
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,425
You knew about this?

328
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,454
Well, gee, sam, is there
anything else i should know?!

329
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,799
How about the two of you
talk about this later?

330
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,593
We'll need the colt.

331
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:12,017
Where's the colt?

332
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,499
- It got stolen.
- I'm sorry. I must have blood in my ear.

333
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,000
I thought i just heard you say
that you were stupid enough

334
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,896
To let the colt get grabbed out of
your thick, clumsy, idiotic hands.

335
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,500
Fantastic.

336
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,399
This is just peachy.

337
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,300
- Ruby...
- Shut up.

338
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,200
Fine.

339
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,000
Since i don't see
that there's any other option,

340
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,935
There's one other way i know how
to get you out of here alive.

341
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:46,899
- What's that?
- I know a spell.

342
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,767
It'll vaporize every demon
in a one-Mile radius...

343
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:52,926
Myself included.

344
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,549
So, you let the colt out of your sight,
and now i have to die.

345
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:00,899
So, next time, be more careful.

346
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,740
How's that for a dying wish?

347
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:10,298
Okay.
What do we need to do?

348
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:14,243
You can't do anything. This spell
is very specific.

349
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,000
It calls
for a person of virtue.

350
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,285
I got virtue.

351
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:22,900
Nice try.
You're not a virgin.

352
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Nobody's a virgin.

353
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,399
No.

354
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,000
No way.

355
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,656
- You're kidding me. You're...
- What? It's a choice, okay?

356
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,299
So, y-You've never...

357
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:48,300
Not even once?

358
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,316
I mean, not even...

359
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,899
So, this spell...

360
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,599
What can i do?

361
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,548
You can hold still.

362
00:30:00,283 --> 00:30:02,456
While i cut your heart
out of your chest.

363
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:03,700
- What?
- What are you, crazy?

364
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,587
- I'm offering a solution.
- You're offering to kill somebody.

365
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:09,109
And what do you think's gonna happen to
this girl when the demons get in?

366
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,399
- We're gonna protect her. That's what.
- Very noble.

367
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,399
- Excuse me.
- You're all gonna die. Look, this is the only way.

368
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,892
- Yeah, yeah. There's no way that you're gonna...
- Would everybody please shut up?!

369
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,099
All the people out there...

370
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,901
Will it save them?

371
00:30:22,902 --> 00:30:25,202
It'll blow the demons out of their bodies.

372
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:28,516
So if their bodies
are okay... yeah.

373
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:36,364
I'll do it.

374
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:38,215
- No, no. You don't need to do this.
- Hell no!

375
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,999
- All my friends are out there.
- We don't sacrifice people.

376
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,790
We do that,
we're no better than them.

377
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,229
We don't have a choice.

378
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,185
- Yeah, well, your choice is not a choice.
- Sam, you know i'm right.

379
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,000
Sam.

380
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,798
What the hell is going on?
Sam, tell her.

381
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,824
It's my decision.

382
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,699
Damn straight, cherry pie.

383
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,173
Stop!

384
00:31:07,174 --> 00:31:08,799
Stop!

385
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,200
Nobody kill any virgins!

386
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,800
Sam,
i need to talk to you.

387
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,791
Please tell me you're not
actually considering this.

388
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:24,800
We're talking about holding down a
girl and cutting out her heart.

389
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,299
And we're also talking about
30 people out there, dean...

390
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,076
Innocent people who are all gonna die,
along with everyone in here.

391
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:34,772
It doesn't mean that we throw away the
rule book and stop acting like humans.

392
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,523
I'm not gonna let that demon
kill some nice, sweet, innocent girl

393
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,399
Who hasn't even been laid.

394
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,100
I mean, look, if that's how you win
wars, then i don't want to win.

395
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,700
Then what?
What do we do, dean?

396
00:31:51,338 --> 00:31:54,199
I got a plan. I'm not saying
it's a good one.

397
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,499
I'm not even saying that it'll work.
But it sure as hell beats killing a virgin.

398
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,300
Okay, so, what's the plan?

399
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,300
Open the doors,
let them all in...

400
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,274
And we fight.

401
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,299
- Get the equipment to work?
- Yeah.

402
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,503
- So?
- So, this is insane.

403
00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:18,157
You win "understatement of the year."
Look, i get it. You think...

404
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:20,099
I don't think... i know.

405
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,581
It's not gonna work.

406
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,129
So long, boys.

407
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,105
- So, you're just gonna leave?
- Hey.

408
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,261
I was gonna kill myself
to help you win.

409
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:34,641
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you lose.

410
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And i'm disappointed...
because i tried.

411
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,199
I really did.

412
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:46,805
But, clearly,
i bet on the wrong horse.

413
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,600
Do you mind letting me out?

414
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,820
I'm leaving.

415
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,716
Who wants to stop me?

416
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,444
All set?!

417
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,962
Yeah!

418
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Let's do this!

419
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,585
God,
i hope this works.

420
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:53,626
Go! Go! Go!

421
00:35:13,936 --> 00:35:17,571
When this is over,
i'm gonna have so much sex.

422
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,889
But not with you.

423
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,435
We better move.

424
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:31,809
Henriksen, now!

425
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,599
I better call in. Hell of a story
i won't be telling.

426
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,674
So, what are you
gonna tell them?

427
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:35,599
The least ridiculous lie i can come up
with in the next five minutes.

428
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,499
Good luck with that. Not to pressure
you or anything,

429
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,874
- But what are you planning to do about us?
- I'm gonna kill you.

430
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,517
Sam and dean winchester were in the
chopper when it caught on fire.

431
00:38:46,518 --> 00:38:50,235
Nothing's left. Can't even identify them
with dental records.

432
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:54,068
Rest in peace, guys.

433
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,199
Now get out of here.

434
00:39:06,649 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah.

435
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,306
Oh. Hey, there.

436
00:39:27,307 --> 00:39:31,579
Excuse me. I'm looking for two boys.
They're brothers.

437
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,699
One's really tall,
and one's really cute.

438
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,858
What's your name,
sweetie?

439
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:39,476
Lilith.

440
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:03,486
Turn on the news.

441
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,925
The community
is still reeling

442
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:11,502
From the tragedy that happened
just a few hours ago.

443
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:15,612
Authorities believe a gas main ruptured,
causing the massive explosion

444
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,899
That ripped apart the police station
and claimed the lives of everyone inside.

445
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,828
Among the deceased, at least
six police officers and staff,

446
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:28,779
Including sheriff melvin dodd, deputy phil
amici, and secretary nancy fitzgerald,

447
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,010
As well as three fbi agents, identified as
steven groves, calvin reidy, and victor henriksen.

448
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:37,042
Two fugitives in custody were also killed.

449
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:41,411
We'll continue to follow the story here
at the scene, but for now, back to you, jim.

450
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:53,668
- Must have happened right after we left.
- Considering the size of the blast...

451
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,799
... smart money's on lilith.

452
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,937
- What's in these?
- Something that'll protect you,

453
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:03,189
Throw lilith off your trail...
for the time being, at least.

454
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,450
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me. Lilith killed everyone.

455
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:12,899
She slaughtered your precious little
virgin, plus a half a dozen other people.

456
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,407
So, after your big speech
about humanity and war,

457
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:20,248
Turns out your plan
was the one with the body count.

458
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:23,240
Do you know how to fight a battle?

459
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:28,008
You strike fast, and you don't leave any survivors,
so no one can go running to tell the boss.

460
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:31,425
So, next time... we go with my plan.
