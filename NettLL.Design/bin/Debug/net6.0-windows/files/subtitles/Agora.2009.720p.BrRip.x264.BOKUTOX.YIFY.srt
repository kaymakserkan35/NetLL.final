2
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,208
The late fourth century A.D. the
Roman Empire began to crumble.

3
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,292
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,
still retained some of its luster,...

4
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,375
...possessed one of the Seven
Wonders of the ancient world:...

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,083
...the legendary lighthouse,
and the biggest library known.

6
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:49,667
The library was a not only
cultural but a religious symbol,...

7
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,875
a place where the pagans worshiped
their ancestral gods.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,500
The traditional pagan worship
in the city now coexisted...

9
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,125
...with the Jews, and an unstoppable
religion up to now banned,...

10
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,333
...Christianity.

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,167
How many fools do you think
have asked themselves?

12
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,083
why don't the stars fall
from the sky

13
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:33,333
But you,
who've had the teachings of the wise,

14
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,083
You know that the stars
move neither up nor down.

15
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,792
they merely revolve
from east to west,

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,417
following the most perfect
course ever conceived,

17
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,208
The circle.

18
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,250
Because the circle reigns
in the heavens,

19
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,583
the stars have never fallen
and they never will.

20
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,667
But, what about here on Earth?

21
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,833
Here, bodies do fall.

22
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:12,167
But their movements
are not circular but linear.

23
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,917
Watch again.

24
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,542
No, leave it.

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,000
So,

26
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,583
What mysterious wonder
do you all think might be

27
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:30,458
lurking beneath the Earth that would
make every single person and animal

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,583
and object and slaves circular?

29
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,833
What might it be?

30
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,208
The heaviness, lady.

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,417
No.

32
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,167
Synesius.

33
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:50,250
The weightiness.

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,458
No, you're both speaking about the same thing,
but you're not talking about the primary course.

35
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,292
Have any of you ever wondered that your..

36
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,542
that your feet...

37
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,917
your feet

38
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,500
are standing on the very center of the cosmos

39
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:13,792
that holds all things together
and pulls them together

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,542
If there were no center,
then the universe would be

41
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,667
shapeless, infinite, formless,

42
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,333
chaotic.

43
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,083
Will it make a little difference if
we were here or there or anywhere?

44
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,708
And we'd all be better off
never have been born.

45
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:34,167
Library of Alexandria 391 AD

46
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,917
God, Our Father,

47
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,875
Lord of the universe,

48
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,292
origin of all things,

49
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,333
eternal force of the cosmos,

50
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:59,417
where everything has
its beginning and everything its end.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,292
Almighty Serapis,
Isis, Horus,

52
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:08,083
Anubis and all the other gods
we ask for your protection.

53
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,750
both in heaven
and on earth...

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,750
I don't know what's happening in the market.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,917
I know you also feel something.
I've seen.

56
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,292
Tell the master we're leaving.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,250
Can you believe? He was courting me
as if I'm one of his conquests.

58
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:31,208
This Orestes is as foolish
as his father.

59
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,167
I already suggested that he devote
his heart to another muse

60
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:38,167
one more beautiful than I.

61
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,833
- Who?
- Music.

62
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,917
Music?

63
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,500
He didn't find his music.

64
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,542
What happen?
227 ever become 16.

65
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,583
Look at this, it's 14.

66
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:59,667
They behave like humans!
They eat, drink and fornicate!

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,083
If my gods  eat, drink
and fornicate, good for them.

68
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,750
Know this,

69
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:14,083
you who console yourself
with pagan images.

70
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,083
Men, women,
birds, reptiles!

71
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,958
Serapis!

72
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:23,833
Serapis! Who could trust
the God, need a flower pot

73
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,833
for a crown?

74
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,250
Hey you, Christians, how arrogant
you'd become now that the

75
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,875
Empire allows you to exist.

76
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,917
My father's father saw them

77
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,083
slaughtered in the circus

78
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,833
and fed to the lions.

79
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,667
Enough! Watch.

80
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,625
Watch.

81
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,542
I shall now walk across the fire.

82
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,250
If my God...

83
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:59,583
If my God is the true god,
I shall suffer no harm.

84
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,458
If however, your gods exist

85
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:04,375
they will roast me like a pig.

86
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,583
You...

87
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,917
You're a lie!

88
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:13,958
You'll get what you deserve.

89
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:38,125
Now, let's see if you can
walk cross the fire.

90
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,083
What are you doing?

91
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,000
Stop, you can't do that!
Let the man go.

92
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,583
Be quiet pagan or we'd
call you in as well.

93
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,083
Whose is this?

94
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,417
Whose is this?

95
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,167
How many times must
I repeat myself?

96
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,417
Today,

97
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,167
the Christians burned a man.

98
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,292
Right in the middle of the Agora!

99
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,792
I will not have this in my house!

100
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,333
Not in the house of Theon!

101
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,250
Give it to me.

102
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Give it to me!

103
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,708
Master, I beg mercy
for your slave girl.

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,083
- Davus!
Get up.

105
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,167
You have nothing to do
with this.

106
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,833
I too, am a Christian.

107
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,500
What did you say?

108
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,417
I too, am a Christian.
Punish me for the both of us.

109
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,417
So, now they presume
to teach us mercy.

110
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,500
Get a whip.
- Father!

111
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,292
Please wait until
you calm before you...

112
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,083
Father, I beg of you.
I beg of you

113
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,958
wrapped in a blazing brightness.

114
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,833
It was the flames, stupid.

115
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,250
Then why didn't he burn
like the pagan? Tell me.

116
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:36,542
Leave us...

117
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,167
Come here.

118
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,417
Kneel.

119
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Tell me, is it true that
you're a Christian?

120
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,625
I don't know what to say, Mistress.
- Why not?

121
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,958
If I said yes, that would be a lie.

122
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,958
If I said no, that'd mean I lied to
my master. I don't know which one's worst.

123
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,250
Then you should say nothing at all.

124
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,000
There.

125
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,000
Thank you.

126
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:48,333
I want you to know that the Master
is upset with himself about this.

127
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,250
What is that?

128
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,208
Something I made, Mistress.

129
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,500
But it looks like a...

130
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,250
What is it?

131
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,500
It's Ptolemaic System.

132
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,250
It is.

133
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,083
Did you do this?

134
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,000
Earth

135
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,458
is the center of the cosmos

136
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,000
and revolving around it

137
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,750
the Sun

138
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,500
and the five wanderers: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

139
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,333
Obstinately disobeying
the law of the circle.

140
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,292
Nevertheless, Ptolemy shows
us that they do obey.

141
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,750
The fact that we see them move

142
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,208
in a loop

143
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,667
is due to the joint
effect of two circles.

144
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,417
One that...

145
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,708
travels around the Earth

146
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,333
and another lesser circle

147
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,750
prophet to each wanderer.

148
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,417
Look, the epicycles.
- See, it's not heaven or earth.

149
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,333
But our eyes
that deceive us.

150
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,708
Well said, Davus.

151
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:04,500
I'd like you to know that
your exposition shows me

152
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,875
that you've been paying
closer attention than...

153
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,583
One or two..others here.

154
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,083
I tell you, the gods
should have consulted me

155
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,667
before they created anything.

156
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,583
Why do you say that, Orestes?

157
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,167
It all seem so whimsical!

158
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,875
Why the joint effect
of two circles?

159
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:32,500
Wouldn't it be more perfect,
if the wanderers didn't wander...

160
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:35,833
and a single circle
gave sense to everything?

161
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,667
Orestes, by what authority
do you judge the work of God?

162
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,125
What is wrong with you, Christians?

163
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,667
Can a man no longer open
his mouth in this city?

164
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,208
If you criticize creation, you criticize
our Lord and you offend us.

165
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,083
You should move out to the desert.

166
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,167
You won't hear anything
to offend you out there.

167
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,583
You know nothing of what you speak.
None of you.

168
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,792
Synesius, what is Euclid's first rule?

169
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,583
Why the question?

170
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,500
Just.. answer me.

171
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:14,667
If...

172
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,542
if two things are equal
to a third thing...

173
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,750
then they are all equal to each other.

174
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,750
Good.

175
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,083
Now, are you both not similar to me?

176
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,417
Yes.

177
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,167
And you, Orestes?

178
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,583
Yes.

179
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,000
Now, I'm actually saying this to
everybody here in this room.

180
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,583
More things unite us...

181
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,417
than divide us.

182
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:47,292
Now, whatever maybe going
on in the streets. We are brothers.

183
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,250
We are brothers.

184
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,417
I want you to remember that brawls
are for slaves and periphera.

185
00:14:56,167 --> 00:15:00,333
Now I think we should all honor Davus
with some very well earned applause.

186
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,792
He'll judge us all
alive and dead.

187
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,417
And then it will be too late,

188
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,250
because only those who believed in Jesus

189
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,542
will be saved.

190
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,833
What are you waiting for?

191
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,917
What are you waiting for?

192
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,250
The Kingdom of God is upon us.

193
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,375
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

194
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,625
Yes.

195
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:33,833
Yeah but do you
understand like men do?

196
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,458
Do you, not your head, a sheep?

197
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,167
What are you looking at?

198
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,500
Yes, you.

199
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,333
What are you looking here?

200
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,333
Are you Ammonius?

201
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,667
The man who performed the miracle?

202
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,958
Do you want to see a miracle?

203
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,750
Are you the one?

204
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,292
I am.

205
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,208
Come with me.

206
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,458
Jesus went throughout Galilee

207
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,250
teaching in their synagogues.

208
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,083
Preaching the good news
for you

209
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:16,167
and healing the diseases of sick.

210
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,083
News about him spread
going to Syria

211
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,958
and people came from
all over the world.

212
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,833
That is Theophilus.

213
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,542
Bishop.

214
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,333
For theirs is the Kingdom
of Heaven.

215
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,833
Blessed are those who mourn

216
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,542
for they will be comforted.

217
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,708
Blessed are the meek

218
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,458
for they will inherit the earth.

219
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,167
Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst for righteousness

220
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,167
for they will be filled.

221
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,417
The word of God!

222
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,500
Blessed are
the merciful

223
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,667
for they will be shown mercy.

224
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:03,417
Blessed are
the pure in heart,

225
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,417
for they will see God.

226
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,417
The Lord be with you.

227
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,833
So how are you able
to escape the flames?

228
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,667
The Lord be with you.
- And with you.

229
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
What do you think I did?
I prayed.

230
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,750
You probable do not even know how.

231
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,000
What do you have in that sack?

232
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,583
Do you have any food here?
- It's for my Master.

233
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,333
What's wrong with you?

234
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,458
I have to pay for that
with my own money!

235
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,250
What do you need money for?

236
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,667
Look at their faces.

237
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,167
Here.

238
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,583
I want you to try it yourself.

239
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:53,250
And afterwards I will
teach you how to pray.

240
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,583
Go on.

241
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,917
The Lord be with you.
- Bless you.

242
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:02,917
See?

243
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,917
That is a miracle!

244
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,833
Go on, keep doing it.

245
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,125
The Lord be with you.

246
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,875
Please.

247
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,208
Thank you.

248
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:26,958
Bless you,

249
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,000
God bless you.

250
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:33,208
Bless you.

251
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,083
Hey, slave!

252
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,875
What is your name?

253
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,542
Davus.

254
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,250
Davus the slave!

255
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,250
Now, you look like
a true parabolani.

256
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:07,292
A true soldier of Christ.

257
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,333
What are they saying now?

258
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,833
Telling them to dance.

259
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,750
The men are now heavy with wine.

260
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,167
All aboard!

261
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,375
Oh what an unfortunate wreck.

262
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,250
Save your servants!

263
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,125
End of Part Two!

264
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,792
Thank you, audience, thank you.

265
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,083
Now, excuse the delay
while we move things around

266
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,583
and change our costumes.

267
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,333
Good evening

268
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,792
Forgive my boldness.

269
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,167
I am Orestes,

270
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,917
son of Orestes.

271
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm here to...

272
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,750
I'm here to declare my love
for Hypatia, the philosopher.

273
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,333
I mean, you all no doubt know

274
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,042
for some time now,
following her counseling.

275
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,083
I have devoted myself to music.

276
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,708
In the hope of seeking solace
in the harmony of its sounds.

277
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,083
But for me,

278
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,083
such harmony

279
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,917
resides only in my lady.

280
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,583
So,

281
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,042
My purpose here is merely to...

282
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,417
offer my melody

283
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,167
in the hopes of...

284
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,833
Stop talking.

285
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,917
That man will go far, I tell you.

286
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:55,625
He's my preferred fruit for the banana
not the fig, I would have already fallen

287
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,167
at his feet.

288
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,167
Wouldn't it be best to please him?

289
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,083
Me?

290
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,250
How?

291
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:10,000
Granting him your daughter's hand.
Why don't you ever plan to marry her off?

292
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:14,792
Hypatia subject to a man?
Without freedom to teach?

293
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,125
Or even to speak her mind.

294
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:23,958
The most brilliant philosopher
I know, having to give up her science.

295
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:27,083
No, that could be death to her.

296
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:35,000
It's true.
Her work is admirable.

297
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,833
That she's brilliant and virtuous.

298
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,333
But Theon,

299
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,083
She has not found her gift.

300
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,583
Being a woman, I mean.

301
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:53,542
Our Father
who art in heaven...

302
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Don't let anyone have her.

303
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:08,250
Please, don't anyone else have her.

304
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,750
Don't let anyone else have her.

305
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,667
Amen.

306
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,333
Good day, lady.

307
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,833
Good day, lady.

308
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,000
Good day, lady.

309
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,250
Good day lady.

310
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,167
Yesterday, many of you would
have seen one of your colleagues

311
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,167
present me an ollos

312
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,417
I accepted the gift.

313
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,500
And today I wish to make him
earn a gift of my own in return.

314
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,500
This is for you.

315
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:20,750
It is the blood of my cycle.

316
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:26,458
Orestes you...

317
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,792
You say that you have
found harmony in me.

318
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,875
Well, I am suggesting
that you look elsewhere

319
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,917
because I think that there
is little harmony or...

320
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,958
beauty in that.

321
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,333
Don't you agree?

322
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,875
Yesterday we were discussing
the Apollonian cone.

323
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:00,625
We discussed the circle,
the ellipse, the parabola.

324
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,667
Today we will discuss the hyperbola.
- Lady!

325
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,583
Forgive me, Lady.

326
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,125
Olympius requires your presence

327
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,208
urgently in the Serapeum.

328
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,250
You as well.

329
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:31,167
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you, Lord.

330
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,542
Thank you, Lord.

331
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:38,250
How are we to enjoy them
force feeding us the faith

332
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:42,583
and customs to people who
until recently becoming outlaws?

333
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,417
- What's happening?
- It's despicable. A sacrilege.

334
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,708
Christians
have gathered in the Agora.

335
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,500
They are mocking the gods.

336
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,875
We must put an end
these insults!

337
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:53,542
They may not fear him,

338
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:57,000
but they will fear our swords.

339
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:01,750
Wait!

340
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:02,917
Wait!

341
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,083
Now, what is it you are going to do?

342
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,583
Are you going to attack them?

343
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,333
Are you going to stain your hands
with blood for an insult?

344
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:15,625
To the gods!
An insult to the gods!

345
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,458
Well, if you think it
is so outrageous then go

346
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,583
and announce their
acts before the prefect.

347
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,667
One might think that
you're protecting them.

348
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,500
I am trying to protect our disciples.

349
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:27,167
You, are inciting them
to be violent murderers.

350
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:32,167
Theon, as director,
you have the last word.

351
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,917
The insult must be answered.

352
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:44,375
Those Jews amongst you do as
you please. This is not your battle.

353
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,125
As for you Christians, you would
do well to join those of your own fate.

354
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,750
You will not caused my disciples
out of this house!

355
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:55,208
- Glory be to Serapis!
- And all the gods!

356
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:57,708
Wait for my command!

357
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,500
No one must suspect us
until we have them surrounded.

358
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,500
The clubs are for the slaves.
Slaves!

359
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,708
Slaves are all for summon!

360
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,417
Davus, back.

361
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,667
No. Go back.

362
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:15,917
Death to Christians!

363
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,750
Glory be to Serapis!

364
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:47,708
Let's listen to her now!

365
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,708
Do you hear any complaint?

366
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,375
No!

367
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,833
This one has lost her voice too!

368
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,083
Their mouths do not speak,

369
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,042
their eyes do not see,

370
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,000
their nose doesn't smell.

371
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,542
Yet still, pagans come here
and kneel before them.

372
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,583
What madness is this?

373
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,833
For the gods!

374
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,083
Medorus!

375
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,583
Take care of your master!
Protect it..!

376
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,500
God is one!

377
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,917
Death to the pagans!

378
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,250
You! What are you looking at?
Get there and fight!

379
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,250
Fight!

380
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,792
Are you deaf?
I said fight!

381
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,333
I'm a Christian!

382
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,333
I am a Christian!

383
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:35,208
I am a Christian!

384
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,500
- What is Christ?
- Christ is one!

385
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,583
Death to the pagans!

386
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,000
God is one!

387
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,583
No! No!

388
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:01,167
The entrance!
We must defend the entrance!

389
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,250
What's happening?

390
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,833
Our men are being sent
back by the Christians!

391
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,792
Father!

392
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:28,542
It's alright. It's alright.

393
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,083
What happened?

394
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,792
It was his slave.

395
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:40,083
Davus, get me some cloth
some water, quickly.

396
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,292
Father...

397
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,833
Synesius, we must get out of here.

398
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,333
Hold him still.

399
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,583
Parabolani are coming!

400
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,250
God is with us!

401
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,750
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

402
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:29,250
- Close the gates!
- You know our men are still out there!

403
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:31,875
May the gods protect them.

404
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,750
Close the gates..I said!

405
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:04,667
Don't kill him! He'll be our hostage
like the others. Did you hear it everyone?

406
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,000
Any Christian you
catch is now a hostage.

407
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,667
Take our wounded to the temple
and the Christians down into the cellars.

408
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:16,333
And anyone with a good eye
and a good aim up on the walls.

409
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:17,833
Olympius.

410
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,583
This one is a Christian.

411
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,750
Yes, and those three as well.

412
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:25,417
If they are Christians,
they will go down to the cellars.

413
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Olympius, if you are going
to imprison my brothers

414
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:29,583
then you are going to have
to imprison me with them.

415
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,500
If it is necessary,
I will do that.

416
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,333
If anyone,

417
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:38,417
anyone,

418
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,417
dare lay a finger on
one of my brothers

419
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,167
I swear I'll run in for you.

420
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,167
Look!

421
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,417
Look at this!

422
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,167
Orestes.

423
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,333
Thank you.

424
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,333
Since when were there
so many Christians?

425
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,250
We'll talk to them to negotiate.

426
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:02,833
What are we waiting for?
What can we expect from a Christian emperor?

427
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,792
Except we'll be put in a sword.

428
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,958
Our sense of positive being
the life when his verdict arrives.

429
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,583
Here will do.

430
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,417
No one should
leave the group, please.

431
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,958
Are they going to pray all night?

432
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,250
Davus.

433
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,917
Stay here.

434
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,500
It's safer here.

435
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,667
Just stay with him first.

436
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,958
Synesius! What are you doing?

437
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,625
Lady, sister and mother,

438
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:28,542
May God bless you and protect you.

439
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:51,875
Move back!

440
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,250
Slaves take it to the back.

441
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,458
Slaves get to the back!

442
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,458
If this three one come out.

443
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,167
It's a disaster.

444
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,083
Father, why don't you leave the dice?

445
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,167
Have you been seen today?

446
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:09,083
-No.
- No?

447
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,500
Let's have a look.

448
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:16,125
Promise me, my child, that...

449
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:20,417
when I'm gone, you won't
remember this foolish old man.

450
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,750
I promise.

451
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:26,542
Remember me as I was before.

452
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,583
Before when I could still think and...

453
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,833
I...

454
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,458
work with you and...

455
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,917
I listen to you.

456
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,833
How could I have been so wrong?

457
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,708
Seeing you here locked
up because of my...

458
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,458
Father, please.

459
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,167
I wanted you to be free.

460
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,958
I am free.

461
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:06,875
Hey, Christians.

462
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:08,958
Christians!

463
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:12,708
What's that confident God
of yours doing now?

464
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,208
Maybe coffins for you, scums!

465
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,833
So tell me.

466
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,708
Where are the gods now?

467
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,000
Where are they?

468
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,000
Might as well look for others.
- Others?

469
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:50,333
Which one? The God of the Christians perhaps?

470
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,500
Such boldness!

471
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:59,667
What do you think, Lady?
You are so bold.

472
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,333
Put the fire out.

473
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:24,667
You are indeed bold.

474
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,917
Very bold.

475
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:30,625
I've been thinking about
something you said to me.

476
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,875
Me?

477
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,625
That day that you criticize
the heavenly mechanism

478
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,708
and you called it

479
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,667
whimsical.
- Yes, although...

480
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,000
Actually...

481
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,000
I was criticizing Ptolemy.

482
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,000
For complicating everything
with his epicycles.

483
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,667
I don't know perhaps
I'm just simple-minded.

484
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:53,125
No.

485
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,250
No, the heavens

486
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:58,125
should be simple.

487
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,792
So am I right or..?

488
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,333
What if...

489
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,083
What if there were simpler
explanations for the wanderers?

490
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,000
There is.

491
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,458
But it is so absurd, so old.

492
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,083
That no one gives it any credit.

493
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,833
What theory is that?

494
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,417
Do you think of Aristarchus?

495
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:30,208
Aristarchus maintained

496
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,875
that the earth moves.

497
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:36,125
The strange behavior of the wanderers

498
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,500
was nothing more than an optical illusion

499
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,375
caused by our movement

500
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,500
in combination with Earth
around the sun.

501
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:49,250
- Heliocentric model.
That's right.

502
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,250
The sun would be in the center

503
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:54,583
acting as speaking of it as
"King of the Stars".

504
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:59,167
It would make Earth just..another wanderer.
- His work was lost

505
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,458
in the fire that destroyed
the mother library.

506
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:06,333
This is why we have to
take great care of this place.

507
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,125
Our library

508
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,417
is all that remains of
the wisdom of men.

509
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:14,792
But everytime you drop an object here.

510
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:18,333
Who speaks?

511
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:20,917
Forgive me, Mistress.

512
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,750
I was listening.

513
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:27,917
Speak up, Davus.

514
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:30,083
If the earth is moving,

515
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:33,958
every time dropping
an object it would...

516
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,042
fall further behind.

517
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,333
And the wind would always
blow against us.

518
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,542
And the birds would
lose their way in flight.

519
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:44,875
I told you

520
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,417
Aristarchus' hypothesis
makes no sense at all.

521
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,667
I feel that what you just
said can be refuted.

522
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,958
But right now I don't know how.

523
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,500
Make way for the prefect!

524
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:28,958
Make way!

525
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,417
Make way for the prefect!

526
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,083
Make way!

527
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,833
Listen one and all!

528
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,625
Prepare to hear and obey
the verdict of our Emperor.

529
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:01,958
I, Flavius Theodosius Augustus

530
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:06,042
Emperor and Supreme Head
of the provinces of the Orient,

531
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,917
having been informed
of the events...

532
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,875
which recently took place
in the City of Alexandria...

533
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,958
do hereby declare and command

534
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,875
that the insurgents shall
be pardoned and freed.

535
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,958
In exchange for my generosity,

536
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:34,375
the insurgents will abandon the
Serapeum and the Library immediately

537
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,708
allowing the Christians to enter

538
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,500
and dispose off the premises

539
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,708
as they see fit.

540
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,833
What are we to expect?
They'll destroy everything!

541
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,458
Pagans will
leave by the stable.

542
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:57,500
The Books.

543
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:00,417
And they will be escorted
to their homes.

544
00:46:01,042 --> 00:46:03,250
Obey this, instant!

545
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,500
Keep it together!

546
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,375
Send half of the regiment
to the other side.

547
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:16,458
and send the rest later.

548
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:17,833
Yes, sir.

549
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:20,333
Prefect.

550
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:23,000
We won't be able to
contain this, not for long.

551
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,708
On the cross! On the cross!

552
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,667
Keep yourself together!

553
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:39,792
Leave the lesser works.

554
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:43,125
- Which are the lesser works?
- Just take the important ones.
The important ones.

555
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,083
The soldiers are withdrawing!

556
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:14,917
Slave!

557
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,167
- Have you seen my mistress?
- Just get over here and help!

558
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:28,542
- They're not carrying so many.
We need more help.

559
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,417
Please go and get my father
out of here. Get him out of here now.

560
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,375
Slave!

561
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,083
Go! Go! Go! Go!

562
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,917
Come on, quickly!

563
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:55,625
Hypatia and her students
are still in the atrium.

564
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,083
Are they out of their minds?

565
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,167
If that's what they want, let them burn.

566
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:02,833
Come on!

567
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,500
Quickly!

568
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:17,583
Lady.

569
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,750
Where have you been?
Pick up that sack.

570
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,542
Lady We have to go.
- Pick up the sack!

571
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,833
Why are slaves never around
when you needed them?

572
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,542
I was...
- Move!, move your feet, move!

573
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:35,625
Idiot!

574
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Run!

575
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:00,083
There is no time!

576
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:03,958
Lady!

577
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:06,875
Leave them.

578
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,667
God is one!

579
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,083
Run!

580
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:41,333
Davus!

581
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:43,833
Where are you going?

582
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,250
- We have to go!
- Davus, where are you going?

583
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,958
If he wants to die
for our gods, let him.

584
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:50,083
Please, no.
Please don't do this.

585
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:51,667
- Come on!
- Davus!

586
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:53,417
- Davus, no!
- Come on!

587
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:22,583
God is one!

588
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:23,250
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

589
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:41,167
Slave!

590
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,750
Davus!

591
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,250
Davus!

592
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,917
Davus the slave!

593
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:55,833
Help me with this!

594
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,000
Help me!

595
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,708
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

596
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,917
Pagan sinners!

597
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,250
The Master's wound is festering.

598
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:03,833
I know.

599
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:08,750
I know.

600
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:42,167
Davus.

601
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:09,583
Davus!

602
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:32,500
You're free.

603
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:35,500
Go.

604
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:02,000
Hence forth, in Alexandria

605
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:06,250
only Christian and Jewish
worship shall be permitted.

606
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,250
Pagan sacrifices,

607
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:10,917
worshipping pagan symbols

608
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:14,792
and visiting pagan temples
shall no longer be allowed.

609
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:18,833
Should anyone commit such an act or
dare raise his eyes on the statues

610
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:24,167
of former gods. He shall
be punished without penance.

611
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,250
Damn Jews!

612
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:35,417
Damn Jews!

613
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:44,500
They're just a bunch of good for
nothing thugs, packed animals!

614
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:47,833
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

615
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:51,333
Let Bishop Cyril
speak in his own defense.

616
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,167
Prefect

617
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:56,167
our blessed parabolani,

618
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:59,500
Whom he has just called

619
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:01,333
the Beast of Burden.

620
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,917
Devote themselves true
enough to carrying burdens.

621
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:08,250
crippled, the sick,
the lepers...

622
01:02:08,417 --> 01:02:09,667
And stones!

623
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,333
Prefect, they carry stones.

624
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:12,917
And now, they burst into the theatre

625
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,875
and stone us knowing we will
do nothing to defend ourselves.

626
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,958
Because it is the Sabbath!

627
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:21,167
On the Sabbath you
should honor God

628
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,958
in your synagogues
instead stuffing yourselves

629
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,625
with sweet set of theater.

630
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:28,417
That is why the stones
fell upon you.

631
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:33,542
Prefect, do you hear that?
Now, he's threatening us. This is too much.

632
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:37,417
Friends, there are more things that unite
us than divide us.

633
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,583
We are brothers!
We're all brothers.

634
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:42,083
Where would you Christians be

635
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:45,083
without the Jews?
Jesus was a Jew!

636
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,583
Jesus was a Jew!

637
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,833
There is..something I find

638
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:22,917
disturbing in what you've told me.

639
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,333
- What?
Well,

640
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:29,792
Why does Cyril speak
of cleaning up the city?

641
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,500
Is he not satisfied with
what he already has?

642
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,792
I think he's just trying
to frighten the Jews.

643
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,750
But why say it in front of you?

644
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:41,250
What if really he was
addressing you and not them?

645
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:42,083
Me?

646
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:45,083
Why?
I'm as much as Christian as he is.

647
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:45,833
Yes, but you forget

648
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:49,500
that many of us from
your circle are not.

649
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:50,917
And a full sail, prefect.

650
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,167
Let's go.

651
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:00,000
-Aspasius, you ready?
Yes, mistress.

652
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:04,250
I would like you to take the sack
and climb to the top of the mast.

653
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,500
And now, Lady,

654
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:23,417
Will you finally tell me what
the point of all this is?

655
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,333
When Aspasius

656
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:29,500
drops the sack, the boat
will be moving forward.

657
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:31,042
Therefore, the sack

658
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,917
won't fall at the foot of the mast,

659
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,125
but will fall further back.
I would say about...

660
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:43,542
about here.

661
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:45,417
And what is so special about that?

662
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,500
- Yes!
- But you were wrong!

663
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:04,667
Yes, but this is definite proof!

664
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:06,333
It's definitive. The sack.

665
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:10,417
The sack behaved as
if the boat was stationary.

666
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,500
What does that mean?

667
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,333
I don't know.

668
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:19,083
But the same principle could
be applied to the Earth.

669
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:24,083
It could be moving around
the Sun without us realizing.

670
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:28,125
-Aristarchus.
Exactly.

671
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:32,500
Why do you torment
yourself with that, Lady?

672
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,625
Ptolemy's not perfect but...

673
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:36,750
it works.

674
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,583
Orestes, but you are the one who...

675
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,958
A few years ago, you weren't
so pragmatic, prefect.

676
01:05:44,917 --> 01:05:47,417
Well, a few years ago,
I talked first and thought later.

677
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:08,667
I have Cepheus third.

678
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,708
37.

679
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:14,792
48.

680
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:19,167
Venus and Mars

681
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,333
share house in Aquarius.

682
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:29,792
My father would have celebrated
such a conjunction with a good wine.

683
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,750
The stars will not fall.
- Oh really?

684
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:36,458
No, because they're fixed
to the lid of their chests.

685
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:40,208
The lid will open in two hearts
and then Jesus will appear.

686
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:43,000
What chest are you talking about?

687
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:48,000
Don't you know that the
universe is a gigantic chest?

688
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:52,083
Heaven is the lid on top
and the Earth, the ground...

689
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:56,667
They haven't told this fool
that the Earth is round.

690
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:59,250
The Earth is flat.

691
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,167
Your head is flat.

692
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,708
Read the Scriptures!

693
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:04,583
If the earth is round,

694
01:07:04,792 --> 01:07:07,708
Why don't the people at
the bottom fall off?

695
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,708
What about the ones on the sides?

696
01:07:12,917 --> 01:07:14,583
Why don't they slide off?

697
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,333
Think about that.

698
01:07:19,917 --> 01:07:21,167
Davus knows.

699
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Hey, brother.

700
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,167
What do you say?

701
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:27,583
Is the earth is flat or round?

702
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:32,917
Only God knows those things.

703
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:39,792
Leave them on the ground!

704
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,083
Leave them on the ground!
That's where they belong.

705
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,375
Lady, you must not lose heart.

706
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,083
Today on the boat you made
great progress.

707
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:51,458
Why do the wanderers
bury their brightness?

708
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:53,958
So unexpectedly.

709
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,875
And what is worse,

710
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,375
Why does the sun?

711
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:03,542
Why does it change size
from summer to winter?

712
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,500
Perhaps because...

713
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,125
sometimes it is nearer...

714
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,000
and other times it is farther away.

715
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:12,500
But Aspasius

716
01:08:13,667 --> 01:08:14,583
Watch.

717
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:18,833
According Aristarchus, the sun must be

718
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:20,833
at the center of everything.

719
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:23,750
With us, the Earth,

720
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,292
traveling in a circle around it.

721
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:30,208
Therefore,

722
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,167
and this is the key.

723
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:37,167
We're always at exactly...

724
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:39,917
the same...

725
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:42,917
distance.

726
01:08:43,417 --> 01:08:45,917
Now, if as you just said,
we accept the changes in distance

727
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:48,333
then we are forced to add

728
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,458
and epicycle to the Earth's orbit.

729
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,917
So it's going to be nearer
and then it's going to be farther away.

730
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,083
But now we fall into
the same trap as Ptolemy.

731
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:00,625
Circle upon circles.
- Exactly!

732
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:06,167
So I just do not know
how to resolve this conflict.

733
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:12,917
I mean, the only thing
we could do is...

734
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:19,083
displace the sun from the
center and well...

735
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,583
not to have a center.

736
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:23,333
It breaks my heart, Aspasius.

737
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,292
So tell me,
what do I do?

738
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,708
Rest, lady.

739
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:47,292
Parabolani!

740
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:50,083
- Parabolani!
- What is happening?

741
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:53,125
Parabolani, quick!
Help!

742
01:09:53,542 --> 01:09:55,208
St. Alexander's on fire!

743
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:56,750
It is a fire.

744
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,000
Come on!

745
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,083
Gather water! Get the water!
Quick! Take this!

746
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:10,417
Hurry!

747
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,417
Quick!

748
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:18,417
Come on, come on!

749
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,750
Parabolani!

750
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,500
Parabolani!

751
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,333
Parabolani, quick!

752
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:35,500
Where's the fire?

753
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:39,667
Where's the fire?

754
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:49,667
Jews! It's a trap.

755
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,333
It's a trap!

756
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:15,417
Christians, all.

757
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,958
Last night was a night to deplore.

758
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:22,708
Now I say to you.

759
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:27,292
Grieve no longer
for our dead brothers.

760
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,292
Weep not.

761
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,833
Shed your tears for the others,

762
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,958
for they are executioners.

763
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:50,750
Yes, yes.

764
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,833
Weep for them.
For those who have done this,

765
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:55,917
Know not of God,

766
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:58,958
nor of love nor of parity.

767
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,875
They know not

768
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:03,125
because it is they

769
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:08,833
who repeat the words of the Scriptures
with no understanding at all.

770
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:13,458
It is they who saw
only a man

771
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:16,458
when the Son of God was
standing in front of them.

772
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:18,125
And it is they who in

773
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:22,292
their blindness, mocked him
and crucified him.

774
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,917
Yes

775
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:31,750
Weep!
Weep for the Jews,

776
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,667
those evil butchers
of our Lord.

777
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,667
Because God...

778
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:43,958
because God, God, God
has already condemned them.

779
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,083
It is God's will..

780
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,500
that they live
as slaves

781
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:51,750
cursed and exiled
until the end of time.

782
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:53,958
Cursed and exiled!

783
01:13:55,917 --> 01:13:57,292
Cursed and exiled!

784
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,708
Cursed and exiled!

785
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,333
Lady, do not stop, Lady.

786
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,917
Now all the Jews
will want to retaliate.

787
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,417
I'm afraid you don't understand
what's really happening.

788
01:15:23,542 --> 01:15:27,583
When this is all over,
there will be no more Jews in Alexandria.

789
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:36,667
I'm sorry for busting in like this.

790
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:39,792
Lady, you should the
risk of coming here.

791
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,958
Where are the troops?

792
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:45,208
Why are there no more
soldiers on the streets?

793
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,750
No army could contain that mob.
The entire city is in a frenzy.

794
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:55,083
Calling to the annihilation
of women and children.

795
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,000
A bishop!

796
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,375
- A Christian!
Then lock him up.

797
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:03,958
Prefect.

798
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:06,583
You should have him arrested.

799
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:11,875
It's not so easy.

800
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:13,542
Lady,

801
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:17,583
Cyril knows they both
share the same faith.

802
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:21,667
That places our prefect in a very...

803
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:23,542
awkward position.

804
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:27,000
If he defends the Jews,
half the city will rise up

805
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,333
against his government.

806
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,042
I see.

807
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,750
But if you choose to do nothing now,

808
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:38,667
I believe Cyril will

809
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:43,250
continue to do the same thing
over and over again and until...

810
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:46,083
until there is no one left in this city.

811
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:48,542
No people for this
government to govern.

812
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,667
How naive of me.

813
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:09,667
How naive of me to think
we have finally chose.

814
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:54,500
Jews out!

815
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,708
First, they kill them

816
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:19,917
then they bury them.

817
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:33,833
The Bishop of Cyrene.

818
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,958
- What is he doing here?
I'll find out.

819
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:41,875
It's my little library
of Alexandria.

820
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:48,667
This is where I teach  the children.

821
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:52,917
An Apollonian cone.

822
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:56,583
Yes, I built it to teach them
about the four curves.

823
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:57,792
The Circle.

824
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:01,167
The ellipse.

825
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,625
Orestes should really
be here by now.

826
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,167
Parabola.

827
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,583
And hyperbola.

828
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:12,917
It's truly beautiful.

829
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:16,667
You know, I often look at it
and I always wonder

830
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,958
why does the circle coexist with such

831
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:20,917
impure shapes?

832
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,458
When I get to sit here
and listen to you again.

833
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,250
I bore you.

834
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:30,375
It's been a long time since
I've done anything but...

835
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,083
beat my head against a stone.

836
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:36,042
Anyhow, there are more
important matters at hand.

837
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:37,375
Forgive me.

838
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,417
Two Christians in the hands
of a heathen.

839
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:53,833
It's an outrage!

840
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:02,917
It's an outrage!

841
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:27,917
- How many left?
I don't know but it smells.

842
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,708
Ammonius.

843
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,750
Does God speak with you?

844
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:41,750
All the time.

845
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,333
Ammonius this, Ammonius that.
Ammonius, Ammonius, Ammonius.

846
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:48,833
Today, he spoke to me

847
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:52,292
so quickly, I had to
ask him slow down.

848
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:56,250
Tell me something.

849
01:20:57,917 --> 01:20:59,375
Do you ever think
we're mistaken?

850
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:03,333
Why?

851
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:10,750
I always forgive and...

852
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:16,333
but now,
I can't forgive.

853
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:18,750
Forgive?

854
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:20,958
Who?

855
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,625
The Jews?

856
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:29,375
Well, Jesus pardon them on the cross.

857
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,667
Jesus was God

858
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:37,000
and only He can show
such clemency.

859
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:40,625
How dare you
compare yourself to God?

860
01:21:44,792 --> 01:21:45,833
Brother.

861
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,250
We are still alive.

862
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:53,667
Why?

863
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:55,333
Because it was

864
01:21:55,417 --> 01:21:58,000
His will to save us
from the stones.

865
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:03,125
God wants us here,
doing what we do.

866
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:06,333
Don't you believe in that anymore?

867
01:22:23,458 --> 01:22:24,375
My Lord...

868
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:32,917
Cyril is a very proud man.

869
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:37,833
He'll agree to meet, but he wouldn't
discuss the Jews, only discuss peace.

870
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:41,167
Peace?

871
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:45,083
My suggestion, as your
humble adviser in this affair,

872
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:47,167
is for you to accept.

873
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:49,500
Let peace be foremost.

874
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,833
Lady, what do you think?
- Well..I...

875
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:56,875
I don't think it's very encouraging.

876
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:59,375
Why would he want
to come and see Orestes

877
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:02,583
without any concrete proposals?
- And there's something else.

878
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,708
He won't come to you.

879
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,333
Demands he meet you in the Library,

880
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,333
during the Sunday service.

881
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:13,000
In the Library?
Why?

882
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:17,167
Only Christians are being permitted
to enter the Library since it was stoned.

883
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,375
It is a provocation!

884
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,958
Allow me to suggest.

885
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,167
If you consider your presence

886
01:23:27,292 --> 01:23:28,750
so essential

887
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:31,333
why not let yourself be baptized?

888
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:35,625
The majority of us here,

889
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,958
beginning with our prefect,
have accepted Christ.

890
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:41,125
Why not the rest of you?

891
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:44,375
It's only a matter of
time and you know it!

892
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,750
Really?

893
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,250
It is just a matter of time?

894
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:51,458
Well, excuse me...

895
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:54,083
honored member but
as far as I'm aware

896
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:56,167
your God has not yet proved himself

897
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,500
to be more just or more merciful
than his predecessors.

898
01:23:59,583 --> 01:23:59,875
Lady.

899
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,167
Is it really just a question
of time before I accept your faith?

900
01:24:05,417 --> 01:24:06,875
Why, then,

901
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,833
should this assembly

902
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:12,833
accept the counsel of
someone who admittedly

903
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:16,333
believes in absolutely nothing?

904
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:20,208
I believe in philosophy.

905
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:24,667
Philosophy.

906
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:27,167
Just what we need

907
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:29,250
in times like this.

908
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:31,667
Enough!

909
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:45,125
All these years, I've been studying.

910
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,375
With absolutely no life of my own.

911
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,583
And I wonder,
what was the point?

912
01:24:54,667 --> 01:24:58,125
Whoa, forget about
what was said today.

913
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:03,250
Is this all life holds for me?

914
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:06,542
What else?

915
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:10,417
I doubt anyone could see as a...

916
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,875
devoted wife

917
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,125
and mother.

918
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:15,333
I think...

919
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:19,250
I think everyone in the city
knows the story of the handkerchief.

920
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:24,917
So...

921
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,250
My father loved a woman.

922
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:33,417
Even he...

923
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,583
Who have I ever loved?

924
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:41,250
Except you,

925
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:42,708
Libanius.

926
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:55,750
If I could just...

927
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,458
just unravel this...

928
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:03,750
just a little bit more.

929
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:11,583
And just get a little close
to the answer then...

930
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,750
then I would...

931
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:18,000
then I would go to my
grave a happy woman.

932
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:21,542
Why?

933
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:24,250
Why does that mean so much to you?

934
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:28,542
Right now,

935
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:33,542
this very second, the whole
Earth could be moving

936
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:35,917
and no one realizes it.

937
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:38,125
Except you and me.

938
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:41,167
Believe me Lady, it's best
no one does.

939
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:45,750
Do you really not think it important?

940
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,542
I don't understand why you
insist on moving the ground we walk on.

941
01:26:49,083 --> 01:26:50,708
Well, you saw for yourself
what happened on the boat.

942
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:54,583
Yes, I did. But that does not
necessarily mean the Earth moves.

943
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,667
What if it does?

944
01:26:56,958 --> 01:26:59,375
Hypatia, look around you.

945
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,917
Death,

946
01:27:01,042 --> 01:27:02,167
horror

947
01:27:02,292 --> 01:27:03,750
destruction.

948
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:06,875
If the stars move in a circle

949
01:27:07,292 --> 01:27:10,000
why would they share
their perfection with us?

950
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:14,500
So we do not move...

951
01:27:14,583 --> 01:27:16,167
In a circle.

952
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:17,917
We don't move...

953
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:22,917
Circle.

954
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:26,458
We do not move in a circle.

955
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,083
Ever since Plato,

956
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:41,250
all of them: Aristarchus
Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

957
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:44,667
they have all tried to
reconcile their observations

958
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:47,083
with circular orbits but...

959
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:50,000
What if another shape
is hiding in the heavens?

960
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:50,833
Another shape?

961
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:55,292
Lady, there is no shape purer
than the circle. You taught us that.

962
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:58,542
I know, but suppose
just suppose the...

963
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:00,208
purity of the circle

964
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:03,833
has blinded us from seeing
anything beyond it.

965
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:07,583
The same way that the glare of the sun
blind us from actually seeing the stars.

966
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,083
I must begin all over with...

967
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:12,708
with new eyes.

968
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:16,583
I must rethink everything.
I have to rethink everything.

969
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:34,792
Reading from the first
letter of Paul to Timothy.

970
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,167
I desire therefore,
that everywhere

971
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,708
men should lift up
holy hands in prayer

972
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:46,458
without anger or disputing.

973
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:49,167
In like manner,

974
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:51,875
I desire women

975
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:54,500
to dress modestly,

976
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:57,208
with decency and propriety

977
01:28:57,292 --> 01:28:59,875
not with braided hair

978
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:03,125
or gold or pearls

979
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:06,583
or expensive clothes,

980
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:10,292
but with good deeds.
- Why is he reading this passage?

981
01:29:10,417 --> 01:29:15,083
I don't know, prefect.
I assure you it is not the one we agreed on.

982
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,833
That a woman learn

983
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:21,583
in quietness and in full submission.
I do not permit a woman...

984
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:25,417
to teach or to have authority
over a man,

985
01:29:27,917 --> 01:29:29,583
but to be

986
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,875
in silence.

987
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,500
This is the word of God!

988
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,083
Amen.

989
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:43,750
Amen.

990
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:47,292
Jesus himself

991
01:29:47,792 --> 01:29:49,875
knew this when he

992
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,458
entrusted his holy legacy
to twelve men

993
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,542
Men.

994
01:29:55,917 --> 01:29:57,917
Not a woman among them.

995
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:00,500
And yet,

996
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:04,583
I know of some in Alexandria

997
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:07,417
who admire and even
trust in the word of a woman.

998
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:11,250
The philosopher Hypatia.

999
01:30:12,417 --> 01:30:15,083
A woman who declared,

1000
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:18,000
in public, her ungodliness.

1001
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,333
A witch!

1002
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:28,125
Dignitaries,

1003
01:30:28,667 --> 01:30:33,542
it is time for you all to
reconcile yourselves with Christ.

1004
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:46,250
This is the word of God.

1005
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:51,875
Kneel before it
and embrace its truth.

1006
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:35,625
Kneel.

1007
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,958
Is he not going to kneel?

1008
01:31:42,083 --> 01:31:44,500
Is he not going to kneel?

1009
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:54,167
Kneel!

1010
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:56,250
Kneel!

1011
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,833
Sinner!

1012
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,167
I am a Christian!

1013
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,792
- I am a Christian!
- You're not a Christian!

1014
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,292
I'm as Christian as you are.

1015
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:25,333
Make way for the prefect!

1016
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:27,292
Make way!

1017
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:40,625
I am a baptized Christian!

1018
01:32:41,042 --> 01:32:43,250
I am a baptized Christian!

1019
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:49,375
I'll kill you.

1020
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,042
I am as Christian as you.

1021
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,958
I am as Christian as you are.

1022
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,667
I mean, how could such
a thing be possible?

1023
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,167
The culprit has been executed.

1024
01:33:49,667 --> 01:33:51,625
I would like you to take me
to the prefect immediately.

1025
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,542
Lady, he himself gave the order

1026
01:33:53,667 --> 01:33:56,667
for you to be confined to
the house until further notice.

1027
01:33:57,083 --> 01:34:00,083
At the moment your presence
on the streets is not advisable.

1028
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:02,708
For what reason?

1029
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:08,958
Cyril has made some serious
accusations against you.

1030
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,583
And um...

1031
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,417
What does he accused me of?

1032
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:17,583
Ungodliness...

1033
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:20,000
And witchcraft.

1034
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,083
I see.

1035
01:34:38,542 --> 01:34:40,750
Is something bothering you, Lady?

1036
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:42,917
No.

1037
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:48,958
Why don't you tell me
what's worrying you?

1038
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,958
Prefect, why don't you bite on it?

1039
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,292
Speak.

1040
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,792
The Bishop of Cyrene wishes to see you.

1041
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:23,667
All of you...

1042
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,417
Prefect, the wound is not yet closed.

1043
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,000
Get out.
Get out!

1044
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,667
All of you out!
Out!

1045
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:45,833
Well, that went well.

1046
01:35:47,417 --> 01:35:50,208
You think I had a part on this?

1047
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:52,167
Would I show my face here
if I wanted to betray you?

1048
01:35:52,417 --> 01:35:56,333
- Are you blind?
I was, yes, I was blind.

1049
01:35:57,417 --> 01:35:58,542
Well, it's my head.

1050
01:35:58,667 --> 01:36:01,250
He's wanted all along, it's me...

1051
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:03,417
that snake is after.

1052
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:06,667
This government!

1053
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,667
This city!

1054
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:11,667
Now, listen.

1055
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:15,333
- War is brewing.
I know.

1056
01:36:16,167 --> 01:36:17,583
I know.

1057
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:22,917
Do you swear your loyalty to me?

1058
01:36:24,917 --> 01:36:26,875
To the Empire?
Do it.

1059
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,083
Condemn him or get out.

1060
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,417
I will do it.

1061
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:44,083
On my knees, if necessary.

1062
01:36:44,667 --> 01:36:46,458
And not only that.

1063
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:49,583
In a few days, I can gather
other bishops from the province

1064
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:52,292
and amongst from the
desert all against Cyril.

1065
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:05,500
First, I must ask you a question.

1066
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:09,083
Orestes, do you believe in Jesus?

1067
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:10,625
Do I what?

1068
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,500
- Do you believe in Jesus?
- Do I what!?

1069
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:14,792
Are you a true Christian?

1070
01:37:14,917 --> 01:37:17,917
Or did you like so many
others, only convert

1071
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,417
- to prosper in politics?
- Synesius.

1072
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,750
Why didn't you kneel?

1073
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:23,750
- What choice did I have?
- Why didn't you kneel?

1074
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:25,500
What choice did I have?

1075
01:37:26,667 --> 01:37:28,667
Betray Hypatia?

1076
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:31,250
Condemn her?

1077
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:32,500
Would you have done that?

1078
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:34,375
I would never offend God.

1079
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:37,708
It's he, he is offending God.
He is offending him.

1080
01:37:37,917 --> 01:37:41,875
He's twisting his words,
he's using the Scriptures.

1081
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,333
He read

1082
01:37:44,083 --> 01:37:46,042
what is written.

1083
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
How many women do you obey?

1084
01:37:51,167 --> 01:37:52,500
How many?

1085
01:37:52,917 --> 01:37:55,625
How many do you
admire and listen to?

1086
01:37:57,917 --> 01:37:59,167
Only

1087
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:00,750
One.

1088
01:38:04,792 --> 01:38:06,167
Only one.

1089
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:07,917
The Scripture...

1090
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,750
The Scripture is correct...

1091
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:15,000
and it was in His hands.

1092
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,083
Brother, don't you see?

1093
01:38:19,167 --> 01:38:21,583
Don't you see the insult to God?

1094
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:25,625
In front of everyone.

1095
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:31,667
I don't know...

1096
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:36,333
I don't know what...
what I believe.

1097
01:38:36,458 --> 01:38:38,000
You have to tell him.

1098
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:41,250
Go tell him now, Orestes.
Tell him you believe in what is written.

1099
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:44,792
Don't tell me.
Tell Him.

1100
01:38:46,583 --> 01:38:48,333
Tell God.

1101
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:50,083
Kneel!

1102
01:38:52,417 --> 01:38:54,083
Kneel!

1103
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,583
Many are those who
remember today the miracles

1104
01:39:18,583 --> 01:39:20,833
our beloved brother
performed in life.

1105
01:39:23,542 --> 01:39:25,833
Like the time he commended
himself to the Father

1106
01:39:25,917 --> 01:39:29,667
and threw himself into fire
and was not even singe.

1107
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:32,292
Ammonius,

1108
01:39:33,417 --> 01:39:37,000
dead of bravely defending
your faith in Christ.

1109
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:41,875
I proclaim you a martyr.

1110
01:39:43,417 --> 01:39:45,083
A saint.

1111
01:39:49,667 --> 01:39:52,500
From now on,
you shall be known as...

1112
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:55,083
Saint Taumasius.

1113
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,500
We want justice!

1114
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:12,292
Justice!

1115
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:18,000
May God show us the way,

1116
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:21,333
my dear parabolani.
Little else can I say to you.

1117
01:40:28,333 --> 01:40:30,000
What about the monks of Nitria?

1118
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:32,292
We can win at least 500 of them.

1119
01:40:32,417 --> 01:40:35,000
plus 500 of our own men...

1120
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:38,125
Do you think that's enough?
- He's the prefect...

1121
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:40,000
He has a whole army to protect him.

1122
01:40:40,083 --> 01:40:41,458
Listen!

1123
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,500
Why don't we do something
much more simple and effective?

1124
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:46,250
What are you talking about?

1125
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,375
We can hurt him
where it hurts most........

1126
01:40:51,167 --> 01:40:52,167
How?

1127
01:40:52,417 --> 01:40:54,500
That whore.
- Who?

1128
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:59,792
What if we dared to look
at the world just as it is?

1129
01:41:00,417 --> 01:41:04,167
Let us share for a moment
every preconceived idea.

1130
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:07,083
What shape would it show us?
What shape?

1131
01:41:07,167 --> 01:41:11,042
You once said that the problem
lies in the inconsistency of the sun.

1132
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:13,125
Yes I did, good..good
Put it into words.

1133
01:41:15,625 --> 01:41:18,833
The sun must be at the center,
since we revolve around it.

1134
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:20,208
And at the same time,

1135
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:23,833
in another position since our
distance from it varies.

1136
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:26,042
Yes, exactly.
- How?

1137
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:36,458
How could it occupy
two positions?

1138
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:39,667
How could I occupy
two positions at once?

1139
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:44,083
How could I occupy
two positions at once?

1140
01:42:01,042 --> 01:42:02,583
Aspasius...

1141
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:20,917
Yes, yes. There.
And then the other one here.

1142
01:42:21,042 --> 01:42:23,333
Keeping the same proportion.

1143
01:42:26,667 --> 01:42:29,500
Good. Very good.
Now, tie this end to that torch.

1144
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:37,917
Aspasius.

1145
01:42:38,417 --> 01:42:40,833
I want you to imagine
that this is the Earth.

1146
01:42:41,042 --> 01:42:42,583
And that each of these flames represent

1147
01:42:42,708 --> 01:42:45,333
the two extreme positions
of the sun in relation to it.

1148
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:47,167
In winter and in summer.

1149
01:42:47,917 --> 01:42:52,167
What would happen if both
these positions with the two centers

1150
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,083
of one and the same circle?

1151
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:56,667
But it is impossible, mistress.

1152
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,500
Wait. What do we know about a circle?
We know that the center of a circle

1153
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:02,583
is always the same distance
from any point along its perimeter.

1154
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:03,542
- Exactly.
Yes, so...

1155
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:05,625
What if I divide the center into two...

1156
01:43:06,042 --> 01:43:11,042
but what I keep constant is the sum
of their two distances to the perimeter.

1157
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:16,458
Alright, look. I'll show you.
Watch.  As I move this rod along

1158
01:43:16,583 --> 01:43:19,083
the cord,
as one segment increases

1159
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:21,458
the other segment decreases,
and vice versa.

1160
01:43:22,417 --> 01:43:25,333
Therefore the sum of the two
is always going to be constant.

1161
01:43:25,417 --> 01:43:26,875
Do you see that?

1162
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:33,750
Now, what if we apply this
to the movement of the Earth?

1163
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,375
What...

1164
01:43:52,417 --> 01:43:53,833
figure...

1165
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:56,333
will be obtained?

1166
01:43:59,792 --> 01:44:01,333
An ellipse!

1167
01:44:01,875 --> 01:44:05,750
With the sun at one of its foci.

1168
01:44:07,167 --> 01:44:08,833
Because,

1169
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:11,042
what is a circle except

1170
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:13,333
a very special ellipse

1171
01:44:13,417 --> 01:44:17,292
whose foci have joined so close
together that they appear to be one.

1172
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,250
Perhaps, I'm completely raving, Aspasius.

1173
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:28,125
I mean, why should this be so?
Maybe I'm just...

1174
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:30,083
Maybe I'm...

1175
01:44:40,417 --> 01:44:41,875
What do you think?

1176
01:44:47,708 --> 01:44:49,792
It could well be solved, mistress.

1177
01:44:59,667 --> 01:45:02,583
Well done, we'll continue
with this tomorrow.

1178
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,792
Get some sleep.

1179
01:45:04,917 --> 01:45:06,333
Good night, mistress.
Good night.

1180
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:09,792
Thank you.

1181
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:23,125
Davus!

1182
01:46:26,458 --> 01:46:27,833
Davus!

1183
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,542
What are you doing?

1184
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,125
Lady.

1185
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:01,333
Let me see.

1186
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:04,083
Why don't you sit down?

1187
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,083
Where is everybody?

1188
01:47:09,167 --> 01:47:10,917
Please sit down.

1189
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:13,000
I have..

1190
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:14,917
I have news for you too.

1191
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:24,500
All dignitaries

1192
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:27,000
who have yet to embrace
the Christian faith

1193
01:47:27,083 --> 01:47:29,375
are to be baptized

1194
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,875
in public.

1195
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:37,917
The aim very clear:

1196
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,708
It's to add to our cause,
all the Christians in the city

1197
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:47,417
decent folk, better

1198
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:49,917
to fight for me.

1199
01:47:52,083 --> 01:47:54,250
You speak of battling faith.

1200
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,000
Very well.

1201
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,333
It seems everything seems to
have been decided already.

1202
01:48:09,333 --> 01:48:12,292
I don't understand why you
required my presence here.

1203
01:48:27,917 --> 01:48:29,792
I am not a member of government.

1204
01:48:29,917 --> 01:48:33,667
No, you are more than that.
You are the person I trust most

1205
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:35,417
and everyone knows it.

1206
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,500
What can I say?

1207
01:48:46,042 --> 01:48:47,083
Lady.

1208
01:48:50,208 --> 01:48:52,000
Many years ago,

1209
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:56,458
years ago, you taught us something.

1210
01:48:57,417 --> 01:48:58,750
If...

1211
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:01,250
If two are...

1212
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,250
equal to a third they are...

1213
01:49:03,417 --> 01:49:05,500
all are equal to each other.
Do you remember?

1214
01:49:05,625 --> 01:49:06,333
Yes

1215
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:09,375
The three of us,
we are all good people.

1216
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:13,125
And you, you are as
Christian as we are!

1217
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:20,833
Synesius, you don't question
what you believe.

1218
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:24,583
You cannot.

1219
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,500
I must.

1220
01:49:38,125 --> 01:49:39,167
Well...

1221
01:49:41,875 --> 01:49:43,417
That's a pity,

1222
01:49:43,667 --> 01:49:44,583
Lady.

1223
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:46,667
A great pity.

1224
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,083
Our revered teacher

1225
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:53,417
taken away from what
she herself taught us.

1226
01:49:54,667 --> 01:49:57,083
Or do you think I'm not aware
of the insane things you invoke.

1227
01:49:57,167 --> 01:50:00,500
- Synesius!
With Earth moving around the Sun.

1228
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:03,667
What next, Lady, what next?

1229
01:50:05,083 --> 01:50:06,750
You must let me go.

1230
01:50:07,417 --> 01:50:09,083
Let me in!

1231
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:11,667
- I'll go straight to her.
- Why does she wanna see a parabolani?

1232
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:14,917
- Lady!
Go away before we arrest you.

1233
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,583
- Leave!
- Aspasius!

1234
01:50:17,917 --> 01:50:20,750
It's me, Davus.
Get off me.

1235
01:50:21,042 --> 01:50:22,833
- Tell them who I am
-  I know this man, please.

1236
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,167
What do you want?

1237
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:27,083
I need to speak to her. I need to
speak to the mistress. Where is she?

1238
01:50:27,167 --> 01:50:29,917
Mistress is not here.
- It's urgent! Where is she?

1239
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:31,875
She's at the prefect's palace.

1240
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,667
- Where?
- The prefect palace!

1241
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:36,750
Prefect's palace. Thank you.
-Get out of here.

1242
01:50:38,333 --> 01:50:39,375
Who was that?

1243
01:50:40,833 --> 01:50:42,583
He was a slave once.

1244
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:51,750
Wait, please!
Wait! I beg you.

1245
01:51:01,042 --> 01:51:05,833
If you don't agree, I won't be
able to protect you any longer.

1246
01:51:07,167 --> 01:51:10,417
I won't be able to
have dealings with you

1247
01:51:11,667 --> 01:51:13,667
neither greet you.

1248
01:51:16,333 --> 01:51:17,708
Hypatia.

1249
01:51:19,083 --> 01:51:20,625
Don't you see?

1250
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:23,750
I can't go on without you.

1251
01:51:24,917 --> 01:51:26,250
I cannot.

1252
01:51:32,292 --> 01:51:34,375
Without you, I can't
defeat Cyril.

1253
01:51:36,042 --> 01:51:37,500
Orestes.

1254
01:51:43,958 --> 01:51:45,917
Cyril has already won.

1255
01:52:03,667 --> 01:52:04,917
Thank you.

1256
01:52:05,083 --> 01:52:06,875
I do not need you.

1257
01:52:35,417 --> 01:52:36,458
Davus!

1258
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:41,458
Brother! Where are you going?

1259
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:43,125
We found her!

1260
01:53:27,292 --> 01:53:28,833
Come on, walk!

1261
01:53:29,083 --> 01:53:30,625
Move it, sinner!

1262
01:53:34,167 --> 01:53:36,042
Whore!

1263
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:47,583
Witch!

1264
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,167
Pagan sinner!

1265
01:54:04,667 --> 01:54:08,000
Move! Come on!

1266
01:54:10,333 --> 01:54:11,458
Witch!

1267
01:54:34,583 --> 01:54:36,167
Strip her naked!

1268
01:54:45,417 --> 01:54:46,458
Get up.

1269
01:54:48,833 --> 01:54:53,000
That's it. So that God can behold
in all your filth, whore.

1270
01:54:53,125 --> 01:54:55,208
The way you knock
the prefect so hard.

1271
01:54:55,333 --> 01:54:56,667
Heathen!

1272
01:54:57,417 --> 01:54:58,417
Whore.

1273
01:54:58,542 --> 01:54:59,250
Look,

1274
01:54:59,375 --> 01:55:00,917
she's not reacting.

1275
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:04,500
She will scream all right
when we skin her alive.

1276
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,083
How many of you have knives?
- None.

1277
01:55:11,167 --> 01:55:13,417
Don't stain your hands
with impure blood.

1278
01:55:15,833 --> 01:55:17,292
Let's stone her!

1279
01:55:17,708 --> 01:55:20,625
Let's stone this witch!
- Get some stones.

1280
01:55:21,667 --> 01:55:23,417
- Quickly!
The ones we throw at Orestes.

1281
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:24,583
they are still here.

1282
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:27,000
I'll stay with her.

1283
01:57:32,917 --> 01:57:34,375
She fainted.

1284
01:58:05,917 --> 01:58:07,917
The body of Hypatia was mutilated
and the remains...

1285
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
...were dragged through the streets
and burned in a fire.

1286
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:12,083
Orestes was outlawed forever
and Cyril...

1287
01:58:12,167 --> 01:58:15,333
...took control of the power
in Alexandria.

1288
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:23,667
Later, Cyril was declared a Saint
and Doctor of the Church.

1289
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:30,833
Although not any of Hypatia works
remains,

1290
01:58:30,917 --> 01:58:32,917
it is known that she was an
exceptional astronomer,

1291
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,042
well-known for the mathematical
study of conical curves.

1292
01:58:41,333 --> 01:58:43,333
One thousand, two hundred years later,

1293
01:58:43,417 --> 01:58:45,417
in the 17th century, astronomer
Johannes Kepler...

1294
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,500
...described that one of those curves,...

1295
01:58:47,583 --> 01:58:49,667
...the ellipse, governs the movement
of the planets.
