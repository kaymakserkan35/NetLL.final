1
00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:03,255
Then

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,519
Good night, love

3
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,270
Sweet dreams, Sam.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,088
Sammy, you're my favorite.

5
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:13,824
Does this mean
I have demon blood in me?

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,399
It's you.

7
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:21,314
Mary!

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,712
Look, our whole lives have been
searching for this demon.

9
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:28,120
That thing killed Jess!
That thing killed mom!

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,426
Sam...

11
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:31,128
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:32,223
For what?

13
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:33,590
- Who are you?
- Castiel.

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,712
I'm the one
who gripped you tight

15
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:36,032
And raised you
from perdition.

16
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:38,319
- I mean, what are you?
- I'm an angel of the lord.

17
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:41,998
Samuel colt made a special gun.
This gun can kill anything.

18
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,517
Why would an angel
rescue me from hell?

19
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:49,876
Because god commanded it.

20
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:51,987
Because we have work
for you.

21
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:54,516
Now

22
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:34,418
Ready?

23
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:36,594
Definitely.

24
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:56,933
Hello, Dean.

25
00:01:58,238 --> 00:02:00,595
And what were you
dreaming about?

26
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:06,433
You get your freak on
by watching other people sleep?

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,029
What do you want?

28
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:09,715
Listen to me.

29
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:12,610
You have to stop it.

30
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,747
Stop what?

31
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,721
Move it, buddy.

32
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:19,979
You can't sleep here.

33
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,210
Okay.

34
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,372
Sleep where?

35
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:23,792
Anywhere but here.

36
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:56,706
Perfect.

37
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,036
Hey,
where the hell am I?

38
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,343
Jay bird's diner.

39
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,670
Yeah, thanks.
I mean, uh, city and state.

40
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,965
Lawrence, Kansas.

41
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:34,207
Lawrence.

42
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:35,931
Are you okay, buddy?

43
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:37,774
Yeah.

44
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,913
Tough night.

45
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:43,823
Hey, uh,
coffee here, reg.

46
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,987
Can you tell me where i can
get reception on this thing?

47
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:52,253
<i>The U.S.S. Enterprise?</i>

48
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,597
Thanks.

49
00:03:56,597 --> 00:03:57,471
Nice threads.

50
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,142
You know sonny and cher
broke up, right?

51
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,382
Sonny and cher broke up?

52
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,752
Momdy, April, 1973

53
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,115
Hey, Winchester!

54
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:33,645
Son of a bitch!
How you doin', corporal?

55
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:35,676
Hey, mr. D.
I heard you were back.

56
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:36,452
Yeah,
a little while now.

57
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:39,067
Good to have you home,
John.. Damn good.

58
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:39,863
Dad?

59
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,849
- Say hello to your old man for me.
- You got it, mr. D.

60
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,407
Do we know each other?

61
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,522
I guess not.

62
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,570
Take it easy, pal.

63
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,664
Yeah.

What does it look like?

69
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,814
- Is it real?
- Very.

70
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,289
Okay, so, what, angels got
their hands on some deloreans?

71
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:51,453
How did i get here?

72
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:55,272
Time is fluid, Dean.

<i>It's not easy, but we can

74
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:00,279
Well, bend it back. Or tell me
what the hell i'm doing here.

75
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,667
I told you.

76
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:03,375
You have to stop it.

77
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,959
Stop what? Huh?

78
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,906
What, is there something nasty
after my dad?

79
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:13,214
Come on.

80
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:15,690
What, are you allergic to straight
answers, you son of a bitch?!

81
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,348
Fine young man like yourself
just starting out.

82
00:06:19,844 --> 00:06:23,136
How about i take off
another $250?

83
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,164
Let's do it.

84
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:27,654
I'll get the paperwork.

85
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:37,300
That's not the one
you want.

86
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,126
You following me?

87
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,070
No, no.
I was just passing by.

88
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:44,804
I never got to thank you for
that cup of coffee this morning.

89
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,893
I was
a little out of it.

90
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:47,036
More than a little.

91
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:48,754
Let me repay the favor.

92
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:51,498
This is the car you want.

93
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,740
Oh, yeah? You know
something about cars?

94
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,589
Yeah.

95
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,170
Yeah, my dad taught me
everything i know.

96
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,489
And this..
This is a great car.

97
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:08,273
327 four-barrel,
275 horses.

98
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:10,609
A little tlc,
this thing is cherry.

99
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,973
You know, man...

100
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:14,348
you're right.

101
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:17,116
<i>What are you buying
that thing for?</i>

102
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,243
Kind of promised someone
i would.

103
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:21,471
Over a '67 chevy?

104
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:24,544
I mean, come on.
This is the car of a lifetime.

105
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:28,377
Trust me, this thing's still
gonna be badass when it's 40.

106
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:33,589
John Winchester.

107
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:36,019
Thanks.

00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,517
Dean Van Halen.

109
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,432
<i>And thank you.</i>

110
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:47,634
I was in pretty rough shape
this morning, huh?

111
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,026
No kidding.

112
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:51,476
I've been hung over before,
but, hey,

113
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:54,544
I was getting chills
in that diner.

114
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:57,025
You didn't feel any
of those cold spots, did you?

115
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:57,939
Nope.

116
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:59,010
No.

117
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,924
I swore I smelled something
weird, too, you know?

118
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:03,845
Like rotten eggs.

119
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,844
You didn't happen to smell
any sulfur, by chance?

120
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:07,858
No.

121
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:09,242
No.

122
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,822
Have there been
any cattle mutilations in town?

123
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,879
Okay, mister, stop it.

124
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,879
Yeah.If only I knew
what to stop.

125
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:23,397
Listen, uh...
watch out for yourself, okay?

126
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,740
Yeah. Sure.

127
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:37,867
So?

128
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:42,617
<i>I'll take this one.</i>

129
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:09,351
What's this?

130
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:10,632
My car.

131
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,006
What happened
to the van?

132
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,655
<i>Mary, this is better
than the van.</i>

133
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,281
It's got a 327,
a 4-barrel carburetor.

134
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,084
Mom.

135
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:29,715
Sammy, wherever you are...

136
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,781
mom is a babe.

137
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:35,278
I'm going to hell.

138
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,093
Again.

139
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,694
I should
just talk to him.

140
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,928
My dad's being my dad, John.
It's not you.

141
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:43,562
How is it not me? He's been like this
for how many years?

142
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:46,185
He's just protective
over me, that's all.

143
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,345
He's doesn't want me to...

144
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:49,971
hook up with a mechanic
from a family of mechanics?

145
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:51,246
No.

146
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,752
Hey.

147
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:58,824
I love you
for exactly what you are.

148
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,534
I'll be right back.

149
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:18,075
Why are you
following us?

150
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,174
Are you crazy?

151
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:28,748
You've been trailing us
since my house.

152
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:30,535
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, really?

153
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,921
Okay, how about
we talk about this, huh?

154
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,640
Let me go!

155
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,242
Are you a hunter?

156
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:04,186
See you later?

157
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,358
If you're lucky.

158
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,159
Dean, right?

159
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,712
I'm not sure
you should come in.

160
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:33,966
You can trust me.

161
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:35,373
I mean, come on,
we're all hunters, right?

162
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,353
I mean, we're..
We're practically family.

163
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:42,124
The thing is, my dad,
he's a little, um...

164
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,132
oh, I got to meet him.

165
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,983
You've heard of him?

166
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:47,750
Clearly, not enough.

167
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,058
So, you're a hunter?

168
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:51,780
Well, tell me something,
Mr. Hunter..

169
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,148
You kill vampires
with wooden stakes or silver?

170
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,968
Neither.
You cut their heads off.

171
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,409
So, do I pass your test?

172
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:00,657
Yep.

173
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:04,199
- Now get out of my house.
- Dad!

174
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,808
I don't trust
other hunters, Dean.

175
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,726
Don't want their help.

176
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,573
Don't want them
around my family.

177
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:10,245
Knock it off,
Samuel.

178
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,628
He's a hunter.

179
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,351
Who passed
your little pop quiz,

180
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,794
And now I'm inviting him to dinner.

181
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:16,597
- You hungry?
- Starving.

182
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:17,525
Good.

183
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,589
I'm Deanna.

184
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:19,980
You've met my husband,
Samuel.

185
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,600
Now wash up.

186
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:25,359
Samuel and...Deanna?

187
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,403
Really?

188
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,859
First time
in Lawrence, Dean?

189
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:31,621
Well...
been a while.

190
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:34,468
Things sure have changed...
I think.

191
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,818
You working a job?

192
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:41,042
Yeah, maybe.

193
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,185
What's that mean?

194
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:44,762
It means I don't trust
other hunters either, Samuel.

195
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:50,967
Hey, um...

196
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,318
so, why were you
following me and John?

197
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:54,589
Mm.

198
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:57,628
I thought something was after
your.. Your boyfriend.

199
00:12:57,628 --> 00:13:00,396
But, um,
I don't think that anymore.

200
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:03,426
John Winchester
mixing it up with spirits.

201
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:04,759
Can you imagine?

202
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,565
I saw that.

203
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:09,240
What?

204
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,056
That sour-lemon look.

205
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,208
Now, hold on.

206
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,967
John's a really,
really nice...

207
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,358
...naive civilian.

208
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:21,133
So, what, would you rather me be
with a guy like this?

209
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,612
What? No, no.

210
00:13:22,612 --> 00:13:24,414
Mary, of course not.
It's just that I..

211
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:28,202
That's enough, both of you.
We have company.

212
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:33,068
So, what about you, Sam?
You, uh, working a job?

213
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,477
Might be.

214
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:37,751
He's working a job
on the Whitshire farm.

215
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:41,050
Whitshire.. Why does that name
sound familiar to me?

216
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,773
It's been all over the papers..
Tom Whitshire.

217
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:45,300
Got tangled up in a combine
a few towns over.

218
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,361
That kind of thing happens.

219
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:47,952
Except why was he on it
in the first place

220
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,508
When his crops
are all dead?

221
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:51,630
Demonic omens?

222
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,409
That's what
I got to find out.

223
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,004
What about
the rest of the town?

224
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:56,988
Did you find anything
on the web?

225
00:13:56,988 --> 00:14:00,468
Of...information
that you have assembled?

226
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:03,007
Electrical storms,
maybe.

227
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,773
The weather service graphs
should be here on friday.

228
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:07,756
By mail?

229
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:11,061
No, we hired a jetliner
to fly them to us overnight.

230
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:14,320
You know,
it sounds to me

231
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,570
Like we might be hunting
the Same thing.

232
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,105
You know,
if we go in there in numbers,

233
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:19,552
We'll take care of this
real quick.

234
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:22,676
What part of "we work alone"
do you not understand, son?

235
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,494
And I'm here because...

236
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:33,374
family business, Mary.

237
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,853
Family.

238
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:42,691
What, you'd rather be waving
pom-poms at a bunch of dumb jocks?

239
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:50,934
Uh, where you going?

240
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:53,584
To do the job, dad.

241
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:06,553
Father.

242
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:08,825
I see you beat me here.

243
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,039
The lord is funny that way.

244
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,557
Beth Whitshire...
this is my associate,

245
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:18,981
<i>Our senior senior priest,
father Cheney.</i>

246
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,695
Please accept
our deepest condolences

247
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:23,599
On behalf of the county diocese.

248
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,525
Thank you.

249
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,853
Miss Whitshire was
just telling me all about tom

250
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:30,287
And how normal and ordinary
things were

251
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:31,152
On the day
before his death.

252
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:32,467
I see.

253
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:34,970
So you didn't notice
anything unusual, ma'am?

254
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,808
You mean like my husband's guts
fertilizing the back 40?

255
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:43,050
Excuse me.

256
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:57,802
Charlie, would you like
to tell the father here

257
00:15:57,802 --> 00:15:59,405
What you just told me?

258
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,981
Dad drank sometimes.

259
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,886
Sometimes he got rough with mom.

260
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,454
And that's when the stranger came?

261
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,229
I just thought
he was some bible-thumper,

262
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:12,549
Like you-all.

263
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:14,615
He showed up
about a week ago.

264
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:15,953
Saying what?

265
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,109
Did I want the beatings to stop?

266
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,329
I just thought he was crazy.
I didn't think..

267
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,863
And the next thing I know,
dad's dead.

268
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:25,985
Am I going to jail?

269
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,768
You didn't do this,
Charlie.

270
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:30,376
Did the stranger
want something in return?

271
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,919
He didn't want anything.

272
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,174
Come on, Chuck. He wasn't just handing out
freebies, now, was he?

273
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,918
He did say something
about coming a-calling

274
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:37,365
10 years from now

275
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:39,187
And maybe he'd want something then.

276
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:40,335
Something like what?

277
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:42,478
I don't know, okay?

278
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:45,032
Look, I told you
he was nuts.

279
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:52,205
What do you think?

280
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:53,972
I think he just
pimped his soul to a demon,

281
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,439
And he doesn't even
know it.

282
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,265
Charlie, do you remember
what the stranger looked like?

283
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,439
Yeah, uh...

284
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,495
he's about 5'10"...
white.

285
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,609
He was kind of
normal-looking, really.

286
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,063
Anything else?

287
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:15,559
- There was one thing.
- What?

288
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,203
It's just, the light hit
his eyes in a weird way, and...

289
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:21,480
for a moment,
I could have sworn..

290
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,967
What, that they were black?
Or red, maybe?

291
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
No.

292
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,605
They were yellow.

293
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,442
Pale yellow.

294
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,639
What do you say we just slow down
and talk this thing through?

295
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:41,538
There's nothing
to talk about.

296
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,717
Except you're saying
there's a demon,

297
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:45,209
And none of us has ever heard
of demon with yellow eyes.

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,131
<i>Yeah, well, I have.</i>

299
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:48,567
This thing
killed my family.

300
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,749
- Just calm down, son.
- You don't get it, do you?

301
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:52,574
<i>You are in danger.
We are all in danger.</i>

302
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:54,333
In fact, you need to get
yourself someplace safe.

303
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,924
Not until we know
what we're dealing with here.

304
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,540
Sam's right, Dean..
It could be a demon,

305
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,404
It could be a shapeshifter,
any number of things.

306
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:01,588
I know what this thing is!

307
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,922
And I'm gonna kill it.

308
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,330
That's all the talking
I need to do.

309
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,946
You're gonna kill a demon?
How?

310
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,132
There's a hunter
named Daniel Elkins.

311
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:09,647
He lives in Colorado.
He has colt's gun.

312
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:11,507
<i>The colt.</i>

313
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,065
Yeah, I heard about the colt.

314
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:15,905
I used to tell it to Mary
as a bedtime story.

315
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,421
Well, it's real.

316
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:21,875
All right,
say that it is.

317
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:23,727
You got some kind
of a crystal ball

318
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,439
Telling you
where this demon's gonna be?

319
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,516
Yeah, maybe I do.

320
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,262
- What's this?
- It's a list.

321
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:37,245
Of what?

322
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:39,702
My dad wrote down anyone
he thought ever came in contact

323
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,812
With the yellow-eyed demon..
Who, where, and when.

324
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:43,724
Why?

325
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,375
'Cause the more he could learn
about the son of a bitch,

326
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,866
The more he could figure out
why it killed my mom.

327
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:52,765
Look.

328
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,236
Whitshire farm.

329
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:56,995
I told you
that name sounded familiar.

330
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,471
Whitshire farms..
That was two days ago.

331
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,316
How the hell
is that on your dad's list?

332
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:06,569
My dad could see
the future.

333
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:11,605
Look at this.. Says he's gonna
hit here tomorrow night.

334
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:12,796
Liddy Walsh?

335
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:13,477
Haleyville.

336
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:14,497
That's close.

337
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:16,924
Yeah, it's about 3 miles,
but...

338
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:25,621
I know
you guys think I'm crazy.

339
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:28,301
You seem like a really nice kid,
Dean, but, yeah, you're crazy.

340
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,419
Yeah, maybe.

341
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,959
But I know where
this bastard's gonna be.

342
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,740
And I'm gonna stop it...

343
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:35,816
once and for all.

344
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,265
I, uh,
I'm shoving off.

345
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:53,961
I just wanted
to say "bye."

346
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:54,961
Really?

347
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:56,442
So soon?

348
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:58,712
Yeah,
I have a job to do.

349
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:01,734
Hey,
I wanted to tell you,

350
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:03,900
You know,
for what it's worth, um...

351
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
It doesn't matter
what your dad thinks.

352
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,700
I like that John kid.

353
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,900
You do?

354
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,800
Yeah.

355
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,700
Yeah, I think
you two are meant to be.

356
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,700
Hell,
I'm depending on it.

357
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,466
- What?
- Nothing.

358
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,582
can I ask you
a question?

359
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,300
What's he like..
John?

360
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,600
Why do you ask?

361
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
Just curious.

362
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,700
I don't know.

363
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,300
he's sweet...

364
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,200
kind.

365
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,607
Even after the war,
after everything,

366
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:47,607
He still believes in
"happily ever after," you know?

367
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,600
He's everything
a hunter isn't.

368
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
No offense.

369
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,100
No, none taken.

370
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:01,300
Can I tell you
something?

371
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,771
He's gonna ask me
to marry him.

372
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:07,600
Tomorrow, I think.

373
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,400
Yeah?

374
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Oh, dad's gonna explode.

375
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,500
But I don't care.

376
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,300
I'll run away
if I have to. I just...

377
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,000
I love John. And...

378
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,700
and what?

379
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
I want to get out.

380
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:35,600
This job, this life...

381
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,400
I hate it.

382
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,900
I want a family.

383
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,500
I want to be safe.

384
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:53,800
You know, the worst thing
I can think of...

385
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,300
the very worst thing...

386
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,400
Is for my children to be raised
into this, like I was.

387
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:04,700
Well,
I won't let it happen.

388
00:22:06,684 --> 00:22:08,200
Yeah.

389
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:11,900
Hey.

390
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:15,000
You okay?

391
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,196
Yeah.
No, I'm.. I'm fine.

392
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:22,010
Hey, m-uh, Mary...

393
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:25,200
can I tell you
something?

394
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,429
Sure.

395
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:29,200
Even if this sounds
really weird,

396
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,800
Will you promise me
that you will remember?

397
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,400
Okay.

398
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,200
On november 2, 1983...

399
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,700
...don't get out of bed.

400
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:53,500
No matter what you hear
or what you see...

401
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,100
...promise me
you won't get out of bed.

402
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,700
Okay.

403
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,800
So, what, god's my co-pilot?
Is that it?

404
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:43,500
Oh, you're a regular
chatty cathy.

405
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:45,800
Tell me something..

406
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Sam would have wanted in on this.
Why not bring him back?

407
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,400
You had to do this
alone, Dean.

408
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:58,500
And you don't care that he's tearing up
the future looking for me right now?

409
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,600
Sam's not looking for you.

410
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
All right,
if I do this,

411
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,000
Then the family curse
breaks, right?

412
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Mom and dad live
happily ever after,

413
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,300
And Sam and I grow up

414
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,800
Playing little league
and chasing tail?

415
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,400
You realize
if you do alter the future,

416
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,900
Your father, you, Sam,
you'll never become hunters.

417
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,400
And all those people you saved,
they'll die.

418
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
I realize.

419
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,276
And you don't care?

420
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:32,997
Oh, I care.

421
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,800
I care a lot.

422
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,800
But these are
my parents.

423
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I'm not gonna let them
die again.

424
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,602
I can't.

425
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:48,533
Not if I can stop it.

426
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,500
Hold it right there,
friend.

427
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,900
Drop the gun.

428
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,500
Be on your way.

429
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,001
Can't do it, daniel.

430
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:27,400
Who the hell are you?

431
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,300
A hunter,
just like yourself.

432
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,500
- "Thief" is more like it.
- I just need it for a few days.

433
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,000
Not happening, mister.

434
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,900
Look, I have a chance
to save my family's lives.

435
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,900
My family.

436
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,800
But I need this gun
to do it.

437
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,600
So if you want to stop me,
kill me.

438
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:11,889
There's some hunters
in Lawrence. The Campbells.

439
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:13,300
Never heard of them.

440
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,000
That's where she'll be.

441
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,800
Dean say
where he was going?

442
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,600
He said
he was gonna kill a demon.

443
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,100
Kill a demon?

444
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,300
That's impossible.

445
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,657
Yep.

446
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,774
Where?

447
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,100
Oh, I don't know..
Over in haleyville.

448
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,913
Uh, Walshes, maybe.

449
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Oh, wait..
Not Liddy Walsh?

450
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,200
Well, yeah,
I.. I think so.

451
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,400
Dad,???

452
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,800
We got to help her.

453
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
What's wrong?

454
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,240
I'll be in the car.

455
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:48,565
Hey!

456
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,600
<i>She wants to hunt,
she doesn't want to hunt.</i>

457
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,287
Is this some female
"time of month" thing?

458
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,915
What?

459
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm sorry, Liddy.

460
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,700
It's metastasized.

461
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,600
Where?

462
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,000
His liver, his lungs.

463
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,100
It's time we talked
about arrangements.

464
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,300
No, you have to do
something, Dr. Brown.

465
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,400
<i>There is one way..
A cure, actually.</i>

466
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,800
But I'll need your help.

467
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,900
- What do I have to do?
- Nothing.

468
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,400
Just in 10 years,
I'm going to come to you

469
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,800
And ask for something then.

470
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
What?

471
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,500
Nothing you'll miss.

472
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:40,700
- ????
- Hold that thought.

473
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,200
You son of a bitch.

474
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:53,571
Well, hello, there.

475
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:56,478
<i>Where the hell
have they been hiding you?</i>

476
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,900
I like you.
You got a lot of spunk.

477
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:15,400
You let her go!

478
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,643
Where'd you get that gun?

479
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,853
- Mary, what else did he say to you?
- I told you..

480
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:38,200
Just that he liked me.

481
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:42,300
What did he mean
by that?

482
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,784
Liddy's a strong kid. She'll be fine.
Are you okay?

483
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:50,087
No, dad, I'm pretty far
from okay. Can we go?

484
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:55,227
- Nice job in there.
- I missed the shot.

485
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,400
Take the compliment,
son.

486
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm saying
that I was wrong about you.

487
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,500
We need to talk alone.

488
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,900
We have to kill this thing now,
or Mary dies.

489
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,400
What?
How do you know that?

490
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
I just do, okay?

491
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,694
When?

492
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:22,416
Well, maybe today,probably years from now.
But it's happening.. Trust me.

493
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:25,100
So, what, are you some kind
of a psychic now, too?

494
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:30,000
No.

495
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:32,400
All right,
listen to me.

496
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:38,500
Now, this is
gonna sound a little...

497
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,300
actually, it's gonna sound
massively, massively crazy.

498
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,400
Okay.

499
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,500
- Mary is my mother.
- Excuse me?

500
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,900
And I'm your grandson.

501
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,463
And I know what the hell
I'm talking about.

502
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,000
You want to run that
by me again, son?

503
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
My real name
is Dean Winchester.

504
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,900
I was born
january 24, 1979.

505
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,500
My parents are Mary and
John Winchester.

506
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,800
I don't have to listen
to this.

507
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,500
Mary gets killed
by a yellow-eyed demon in 1983.

508
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:07,900
Now, I think that this,
what happened tonight,

509
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,419
I think this is the moment
that he caught her scent.

510
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:13,047
Now, if we don't catch
this thing now and kill it

511
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:14,900
And it gets away...

512
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,628
then Mary dies.

513
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,800
So I'm asking you...

514
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
please.

515
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,900
Hey.

516
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,600
Y.. You okay?

517
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,584
You promised
you'd take me away.

518
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,600
Of course I did.

519
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
Do it now.

520
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:48,100
How did I know
about the colt, huh?

521
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,600
How did I know
about the yellow-eyed demon

522
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,000
Or where it would be?

523
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,957
I'm not making this up,
Samuel.

524
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:57,446
Every bone in my body is aching to put you
six feet under, but...

525
00:30:57,493 --> 00:30:59,800
there's something about you..
I can't shake it.

526
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:05,400
Now, I may be crazier than you,
son, but I believe you.

527
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,500
Thank you.

528
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,700
How do we find
this bastard?

529
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,800
Right here.. The list.

530
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,500
And with the colt?

531
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah.

532
00:31:23,378 --> 00:31:25,600
Let me see it.

533
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,500
Sorry.
I don't let anybody hold it.

534
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,100
I'm your grandfather.

535
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,000
Nothing personal.

536
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,400
Sure it is.

537
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,500
Especially when it's me
you're trying to kill.

538
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,000
Future boy, huh?

539
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:09,800
I only know one thing that's got the juice
to swing something like that.

540
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,638
You must have friends
in high places.

541
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,200
So, I kill your mommy?

542
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,382
That's why you came all this way
to see little ol' me?

543
00:32:20,428 --> 00:32:22,360
Oh, I came here
to kill you.

544
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:24,941
Hey.

545
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,200
Wait a minute.

546
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:33,600
If that slug marries
your mommy, are you..

547
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,300
Are you one of my psychic kids?

548
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,600
No.

549
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,314
Not you.

550
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,000
Maybe you got a sis.

551
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:48,873
Or a bro.

552
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,059
That's terrific.

553
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
That means
it all worked out.

554
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,757
After all,
it's why I'm here.

555
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:59,900
So that's what this is about..
These deals you're making.

556
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,000
You don't want
these people's souls.

557
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,400
No.

558
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
I just want
their children.

559
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,900
I'm here to choose
the perfect parents,

560
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,200
Like your mommy.

561
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,000
Why her?

562
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,154
Why any of them?

563
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,922
Because they're strong.
They're pure.

564
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:17,700
They eat their wheaties.

565
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,600
My own little master race.
They're ideal breeders.

566
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:23,945
Oh, get your mind
out of the gutter.

567
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:25,900
No one's breeding
with me.

568
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,783
Though Mary...

569
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,737
man, I'd like to make
an exception.

570
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:34,412
So far,
she's my favorite.

571
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:41,300
So, why make the deals?

572
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,500
I need permission.

573
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,575
I need to be invited
into their houses.

574
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,000
I know, I know.. The red tape
will drive you nuts.

575
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,600
But in 10 short years,
it'll all be worth it.

576
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,200
'Cause you know what
I'm gonna do to your sibling?

577
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm gonna stand
over their crib,

578
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,390
And I'm gonna bleed
into their mouth.

579
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,367
Demon blood is better than
ovaltine, vitamins, minerals.

580
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,700
It makes you
big and strong!

581
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,500
For what?

582
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,900
So they can lead
your discount demon army?

583
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,554
- Is that your big plan?
- Please

584
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:15,500
My endgame's a hell of a lot
bigger than that, kid.

585
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,300
Endgame?
What endgame?

586
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,647
<i>Like I'm gonna tell you.</i>

587
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,500
Or those angels
sitting on your shoulder.

588
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
No.

589
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,900
I'm gonna
cover my tracks good.

590
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,300
You can cover
whatever the hell you want.

591
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,858
I'm still gonna kill you.

592
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:36,700
Right.

593
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,900
Now, that,
I'd like to see.

594
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,800
Maybe not today.

595
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,000
But you look into my eyes,
you son of a bitch.

596
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,300
'Cause I'm the one
that kills you.

597
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:57,100
So, you're gonna save everybody.
Is that right?

598
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,400
Is that it?

599
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,100
Well, I'll tell you one person
that you're not gonna save.

600
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,000
Your grandpappy.

601
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,628
No!

602
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:10,838
No

603
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:47,259
Mary,
Mary.

604
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:54,097
I guess it's no secret
Why I brought you way out here.

605
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:56,608
- John..
- Just...

606
00:35:57,445 --> 00:35:59,700
just let me
get through this, okay?

607
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,300
Okay, wait.

608
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,400
There's things you don't
know about me, John.

609
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,200
So?

610
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,900
I will always love you
for exactly who you are.

611
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,100
- What did I tell you?
- Dad!

612
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,000
Sir, just listen!

613
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:26,960
Ow! dad!

614
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,100
Stay away from her!

615
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:29,193
You're hurting me!

616
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,937
Hey, take it easy!

617
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:33,263
No!

618
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:44,300
You killed him.

619
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:47,300
Oh, not just John,
sweetie pie.

620
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,300
Mommy and daddy, too.

621
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,000
They're all dead.

622
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:58,288
- No.
- Yep. 'Fraid so.

623
00:36:58,335 --> 00:36:59,939
You're little
orphan Mary now.

624
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:01,300
You son of a bitch!

625
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,521
Oh, sticks and stones
may break my bones.

626
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:08,730
And they won't bring
your family back either.

627
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:10,400
I'll kill you.

628
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,500
I swear to god.

629
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,900
Oh, let's not get nasty.

630
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,600
Now, look, we both said
some things that we regret.

631
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:24,267
Let's, uh...

632
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,662
kiss and make up.

633
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:30,300
I'll tell you what..

634
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,700
I'll arrange to have lover boy
here brought back breathing.

635
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,500
My parents, too?

636
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,100
Nope.

637
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,896
Sorry, doll.
That's not on the table.

638
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:45,700
Think about it.

639
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,826
You could be done
with hunting forever.

640
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:49,700
The white picket fence,

641
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,500
Station wagon,
couple of kids.

642
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,246
No more monsters or fear.
I'll make sure of it.

643
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,409
What?
And all it costs is my soul?

644
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:04,700
Oh, no.You can keep your soul.
I just need permission.

645
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,100
For what?

646
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,100
In 10 years, I need to swing by your house
for a little something, that's all.

647
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,300
For...what?

648
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
Relax.

649
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,300
As long as I'm not interrupted,

650
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,400
Nobody gets hurt.

651
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,300
I promise.

652
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,700
Or you can spend
the rest of your life

653
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,644
Desperate and alone.

654
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,200
Mary?

655
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,000
It's a good deal.

656
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,459
So, what do you say?

657
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,500
No!

658
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:34,300
- Mary?
- John.

659
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:21,200
I couldn't stop
any of it.

660
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,300
She still made
the deal.

661
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,600
She still died in the nursery,
didn't she?

662
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,200
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

663
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,300
You couldn't have
stopped it.

664
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,600
What?

665
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,000
Destiny can't be changed,
Dean.

666
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,539
All roads lead
to the same destination.

667
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:52,100
Then why'd you send me back?

668
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,800
For the truth.

669
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,600
<i>Now you know
everything we do.</i>

670
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
What the hell
are you talking about?

671
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,300
Where's Sam?

672
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:11,656
We know what azazel did
to your brother.

673
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:16,000
<i>What we don't know is why..
What his endgame is.</i>

674
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,400
He went to great lengths
to cover that up.

675
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,600
Where's Sam?

676
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,900
425 Waterman.

677
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:29,900
Your brother is headed down
a dangerous road, Dean.

678
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,800
And we're not sure
where it leads.

679
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,600
So stop it.

680
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,800
<i>Or we will.</i>
