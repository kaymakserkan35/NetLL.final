[All whoop in joy]

4
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:30,952
Do you feel the spirit?

5
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:34,065
All:
Yeah! Halleluiah!

6
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,380
And in the 39th year of his reign,

7
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:42,484
Asa was diseased in his feet,

8
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:44,545
until the disease was exceedingly great.

9
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:45,722
Yet...

10
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:47,675
he didn't seek help from the Lord,

11
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,200
but from the physicians.

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,986
Now, there is nothing wrong
with seeing a doctor.

13
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:58,095
But can a doctor heal through the power
that Jesus gave his disciples?

14
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,946
Men of science can walk
through life with blindfolds

15
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:05,699
never knowing that you or I
could not take a single step
if we were not uplifted by God.

16
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:13,000
Agnes,

17
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:17,377
thank you for letting me
an instrument of God's love for you.

18
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,026
In faith...

19
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:37,865
Oh...

20
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,082
all things are possible.

21
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:45,225
My friends,

22
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:49,506
I want you to let Agnes
feel the wave of faith
in this church here today

23
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,308
lifting her into God's hands.

24
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:53,218
[All cheer]

25
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:58,510
You can do it.
Come on, sister.

"Oh Happy Day"

27
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,396

00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you, God!

30
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:14,754
Thank you, Lord!
Thanks be to God!

31
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:16,555
Thank you, Lo--

32
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,397
Oof!

33
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,101
Oof, oof!

34
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,288
No!

35
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:39,530
Son!

36
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:44,710
Dad, I think I need a doctor.

37
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,604
Agh!

38
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:54,169
2X19 - House vs God

Original Airdate (FOX): 25 APR-2006

40
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,700
Did you remember my DVD player?

41
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:31,127
Well, if you wanted it,
you shouldn't have left it behind
when you moved out.

42
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:34,544
Now I get it.
It's a drag watching porn on VHS.

43
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,439
I'll call you
as soon as I'm done with it.

44
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,254
That's if you ever
get a phone installed.

45
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,622
Oh, forget it.

46
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:41,951
I'll come by and get it myself.

47
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:44,057
After work? Thursday?

48
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:46,057
Won't be home Thursday.

49
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,255
No problem, I still have a key.
I can let myself in and out.

50
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,296
I guess maybe I could
bring it in tomorrow.

51
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:54,012
After all, how many times
can you hit pause

52
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:56,869
at the part where Lindsay Lohan
wins the spelling bee?

53
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,608
What is it about
girls who can spell?

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,785
It's math contest.

55
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:01,935
What is it about girls
who can count?

56
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:03,280
It's poker night, isn't it?

57
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,356
[Elevator dings]

58
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,547
You said weeks ago
that I could play.

59
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:08,274
- Stop making excuses.
- Gotta go.

60
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:09,634
Building full of sick people.

61
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:11,780
If I hurry,
maybe I can avoid them.

62
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,668
The abdominal series showed
no evidence of obstruction.

63
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:16,684
What'd you have to eat?

64
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:20,984
Chicken sandwich.
We travel. Lots of fast food.

65
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:25,532
Thank you.
I barely felt it.

66
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,415
You're welcome.

67
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:30,634
God told me you were kind.

68
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:34,205
You talk to God?

69
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,691
God's presence often descends on Boyd
to help him guide others.

70
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:39,190
This been going on long?

71
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,746
Since he was ten.

72
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,362
God told me
I would meet a woman healer...

73
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:50,009
who was harboring vengeful thoughts
about a man she works with.

74
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:53,767
That's God's job.

75
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,494
I'll keep that in mind.

76
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:01,648
- His urine is dilute.
- What does that mean?

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,346
It could mean that for some reason
his kidneys aren't purifying
the way they should,

78
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:07,400
which would let toxins
accumulate in his body.

79
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,120
We'll run the blood work
and see what it tells us.

80
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:12,793
Thank you, I appreciate it.

81
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,924
God talks to him?

82
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:21,578
It's not psychosis,
he's just religious.

83
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:24,763
The only medical issue that
showed up on the blood work
is low sodium.

84
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:28,210
No, you talk to God, you're religious.
God talks to you, you're psychotic.

85
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:32,232
A lot of people experience their religion
as something more than symbolic.

86
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:35,260
- That doesn't mean--
- God ever talk to you when
you where in the seminary?

87
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:39,119
No.

88
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:41,384
God's loss, our gain.

89
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:43,533
He's either psychotic
or a scam artist.

90
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:46,340
He was actually
really impressive.

91
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:49,343
Well, yeah...
with the burning bush and all,
it's quite the show.

92
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:52,433
He was intelligent, polite, dignified.
He's not a typical 15-year-old.

93
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:57,092
And he told Cameron God wants her to stop being pissed at me over the article.

94
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:59,269
God knows you stole
Cameron's article?

95
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:02,125
He knows she's
"harboring vengeful thoughts."

96
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:03,615
I'm over it.

97
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:07,376
Yeah, I can tell that from
the Berlin Wall of body language
between you.

98
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,945
I'm shocked
that he picked up on it.
Low sodium.

99
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:11,591
Check for Addison's?

100
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:14,370
No pigmentation and
potassium levels were normal.

101
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:15,371
Cirrhosis?

102
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:18,150
Liver feels fine.
Transaminases are normal.

103
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:22,057
[ Sighs]
We should monitor his saline intake
to correct the low sodium.

104
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:24,278
No more than one MEQ
per liter per hour.

105
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:28,408
And let's push the patient history.
See if there's any evidence
of drugs or other delusions.

106
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:29,769
I'll take care of it.

107
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,189
You're  gonna talk to a patient?

108
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:36,183
God talks to him.

109
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:39,430
It'd be arrogant of me
to assume that I'm better than God.

110
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,687
So, you're a "faith healer."

111
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:50,636
Or is that a pejorative?

112
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,819
Do you prefer something like
"Divine health management"?

113
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,722
I though God might have
mentioned that I was coming.

114
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,008
I'm okay with"faith healer", Dr. House.

115
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:05,595
Oh! That's a nice one.

116
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,552
You didn't even go with...

117
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:09,964
"I see an H and a medical coat."

118
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:11,695
The nurses talk about you a lot.

119
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:14,902
Ah, don't believe them.
I keep a sock in my pants.

120
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:18,175
Faith, that's another word
for ignorance, isn't it?

121
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:22,216
I never understood how people
could be so proud of believing in
something with no proof at all.

122
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:23,345
Like that's an achievement.

123
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,245
God's asking for our trust.

124
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:27,168
You can't love somebody
and not trust them.

125
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,905
Trust has to be earned.

126
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,827
You can't trust someone
hiding in a closet.

127
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:35,239
You don't trust anyone.

128
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,278
You seem lucid.

129
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:40,501
There's no confusion,
no lethargy.

130
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,269
What drugs
have you been taking?

131
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:45,209
Nothing.
Uh, some aspirin. I...

132
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:48,742
get focused on something,
I forget to eat-- Next thing you know,
I've got a hunger headache.

133
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,603
So aspirin and hospitals are okay.

134
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:56,771
That's an interesting attitude for
someone who's kept any number of people
from getting medical help.

135
00:07:56,855 --> 00:08:02,683
Just because
I believe in prayer doesn't mean
I don't believe in germs and toxins.

136
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,464
That bottle's been opened before.

137
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,809
You refilled it
at the water cooler.

138
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:11,384
Yes.

139
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:12,551
How often do you do that?

140
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:15,470
A few times an hour.
He likes to stay hydrated.

141
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:18,911
You think germs
might have gotten in?

142
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,928
I think water
might have gotten in.

143
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,794
We can adjust your pain meds.

144
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,329
Again?

145
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:36,583
Suppose we increase
your Oxycodone.

146
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:41,153
We both know the only reason
I'm talking lucidly now

147
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:44,854
is because I did not take
my full dose this morning.

148
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:50,262
You've done your best.

149
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:52,908
And I have been
a good soldier.

150
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,406
It's time
we accept it's over.

151
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,954
What about the trip
you were talking about taking?

152
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:04,583
You've wanted to see Florence
since you were a teenager, right?

153
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,581
Yeah, go now.
All drugged up.

154
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,877
It's not exactly the trip
I've been dreaming of.

155
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:15,431
Okay, but you're strong.

156
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:17,450
You're dealing with this.

157
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:23,471
And there is the right combination of
pain meds out there. And we'll find it.

158
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,649
Don't give up on us.

159
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,906
And don't be startled by
the sound you're about to hear.

160
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:32,339
[Bangs at a door]
Excuse me.

161
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:37,121
I have a friend
with boundary issues.

162
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:44,107
[Crow caws]

163
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,548
Can this wait five minutes?

164
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,514
Is she dying?

165
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,414
Yeah.

166
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:52,947
Before the end of this consult?

167
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:55,952
They could build monuments
to your self-centeredness.

168
00:09:56,036 --> 00:10:01,053
Patient. 15-year-old.
Faith healer. Hotline to God.

169
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:04,605
- What are his symptoms?
- He is not a saint.

170
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:08,496
He figures out what's going on
in people's lives by watching,
listening, deducing.

171
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,708
And you're worried about
trademark infringement?

172
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:15,633
Then he passes on advice from God
so he can watch them jump.
It's a power trip.

173
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:18,971
Ah, and there the similarities end.
Why is he here?

174
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:20,969
I fear for the human race.

175
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,601
A teenager claims to be the voice of God and
people with advanced degrees are listening.

176
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:29,264
The majority of Americans
believe in a personal God.
What are his symptoms?

177
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:31,102
Massive cramps, low sodium.

178
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:35,028
Turns out he's been
drinking water non-stop.
God told him to purify his body.

179
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,948
Huge water intake
would cause low sodium.

180
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:38,895
Which would cause
the cramping. Yeah, I got it.

181
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:41,328
What, that's it?
You solved it.

182
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:45,689
You  just brought me out here
to rant because faith annoys you?

183
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:48,739
Mm-hmm. He's all better.

184
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:54,145
You know, I'd get it
if people were just looking
for a way to fill the holes.

185
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,294
But they want the holes.
They wanna live in the holes.

186
00:10:57,896 --> 00:11:01,485
And they go nuts when
someone else pours dirt in their holes.

187
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:05,868
Climb out of your holes, people!

188
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:27,726
# Go tell it on the mountain #

189
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,242
# Over the hills and everywhere #

190
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:36,044
# Go tell it on the mountain #

191
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:39,948
# That Jesus Christ is born #

192
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:43,727
# Go tell it on the mountain #

193
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,755
# Over the hills and everywhere #

194
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:51,035
# Go tell it on the mountain #

195
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:54,222
# That Jesus Christ is born #

196
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,277
Boyd, are you all right?

197
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:57,686
# Go tell it on the mountain #

198
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,696
Boyd.

199
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:00,917
# Over the hills and... #

200
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:07,573
Come on.

201
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:10,823
Let's go.
Can you tell meyour name?

202
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:13,250
Do you know where you are?

203
00:12:13,591 --> 00:12:14,925
Boyd?

204
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,886
Boyd?

205
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,560
God doesn't want you to be afraid.

206
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:27,170
He sent me here to heal you.

207
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:30,558
You think he hasn't heard you prayers,
but he heard them all.
Even the ones you didn't say.

208
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:33,026
Sorry. Boyd, come on.
Let's get you back to your room.

209
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:36,399
In faith,
all things are possible.

210
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:37,306
Let's go.

211
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:38,968
Lord...

212
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,860
I call on you to relieve
the suffering of your daughter.

213
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,835
- Grace?
- And make her whole again.

214
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,869
Hey, hey!
What are you doing? What is this?

215
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:48,860
He's just had
a complex partial seizure.

216
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:50,620
His disoriented.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

217
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,421
Well get him back
to his room--now.

218
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,888
You  okay?

219
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:06,239
Are we certain
he even had a seizure?

220
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:09,783
Hymn singing and healing.
He does it all the time, doesn't he?

221
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,114
Isn't it interesting

222
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,116
that  religious behavior is
so close to being crazy,
we can't tell 'em apart.

223
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:17,998
The repetition,
the lack of affect and awareness.

224
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,117
- It was a seizure.
- Infection?

225
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:21,210
No fever.

226
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:22,554
Could be Wilson's.

227
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,912
Or maybe it's
a glycogen storage disease.

228
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:27,786
- Or a brain tumor.
- Or tuberous sclerosis.

229
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,947
Hmm.

230
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:31,886
How to settle this?

231
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:36,177
We could ask our patient to ask God.
Or we could MRI his brain.

232
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,219
Which way do you wanna go?

233
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:38,993
- 'Cause I'm open to all possibilities.
- House!

234
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:42,162
Why the hell do you
let an unstable patient
wander the hallways?

235
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:44,119
His leash broke.

236
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:47,408
The last thing a terminal patient needs is
to hear somebody taunt them with a cure.

237
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:50,171
She was freaked,
she was angry.

238
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:53,820
And now she's
not freaked and angry.
And you are.

239
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:56,815
She says
she's "feeling better".

240
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,942
Maybe not singing and dancing, but
she's feeling just a little bit happy
for the first time in months.

241
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:03,761
Sudden drop in pain
can create euphoria.

242
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:05,427
You shouldn't let her
have her vacation?

243
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:06,862
Oh, that's great.

244
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:10,607
And when the vacation's over,
when she crash lands from all this denial?

245
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:13,116
She was dealing with her illness.

246
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,034
Now her expectations are rising.

247
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:19,076
And you're not the one who
has to be there when all that false hope
gets yanked out from under her.

248
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,317
Don't you guys
have anything to do?

249
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,562
How long have you
been healing people?

250
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:33,804
You believe
that's what I'm doing?

251
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,702
I'd like to.

252
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,522
But you don't.

253
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:42,439
Why do you always do things
you don't wanna do?

254
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:48,398
It's okay,
I don't expect a real answer.

255
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,625
God would probably want you
to take that stick out of your butt
and get over this.

256
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,143
If there is some higher order
running the universe,

257
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:12,641
it's probably so different from
anything our species can conceive,

258
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:14,985
there's no point
in even thinking about it.

259
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,888
But I doubt it gives a damn
about my butt.

260
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:21,295
So you believe God might exist,
but you don't think about it?

261
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,352
It's the most important issue--

262
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:25,284
I think penguins might as well
speculate about nuclear physics.

263
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:26,671
Why are we having
this conversation?

264
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:29,169
What? I'm curious.

265
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:35,458
You cannot tell someone they are
your colleague and not a friend and
then casually chat about the afterlife.

266
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:58,098
You actually keep score?

267
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,600
Your MRI results aren't done yet.

268
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:05,370
Go back to your room.
No singing.

269
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:09,380
Well, you would get a point
for figuring why the low sodium.

270
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:11,339
What are my guy's points for?

271
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:16,653
Your trick about the spat between
Dr. Cameron and Dr. Foreman
apparently impressed someone.

272
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:18,327
And the second point?

273
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:25,695
Do you think it could be
because I healed Grace?

274
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,093
She's been back
to see me. I like her.

275
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:30,781
You like messing with people.

276
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:33,052
That's why you're here now.

277
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:36,499
Maybe you think that
your batteries are powered by God,
maybe you don't.

278
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:39,032
Either way,
you enjoy what you do.

279
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,217
Yes.

280
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:42,004
I like helping people.

281
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:45,761
I get a rush when
I see the look on their faces when
they realize their burdens are gone.

282
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:47,817
Mm, but you make sure
you're in the next state

283
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:51,551
by the time the endorphins wear off
and the arthritis comes back.

284
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,766
That doesn't happen.

285
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:57,110
Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?

286
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:58,752
God told me.

287
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,453
See, that's not fair.
We were having fun.

288
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:08,046
It's hard to keep sniping rationally
when you throw a bomb like that in there.

289
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:15,856
He spoke with me about you too.

290
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,850
Forgive my enemies?

291
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:21,052
Never date a Taurus
when Mercury's in retrograde?

292
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:23,940
Yeah, I learned that one myself--
the hard way.

293
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:26,742
God says you look for
excuses to be alone.

294
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:30,551
See, that is exactly the kind of
brilliance that sounds deep,

295
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:35,000
but you could say it about any person
who doesn't pine for the social
approval of everyone he meets.

296
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:39,207
Which you were cleverly able to
deduce about me but not being a moron.

297
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,528
Next time tell God
to be more specific.

298
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:46,491
God wants you to invite
Dr. Wilson to your poker game.

299
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:03,712
Don't talk to my patient.

300
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:05,791
What are you talking about?

301
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:09,158
You get all huffy when my patient
stumbles into yours in the hallway.

302
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:11,775
But you got no qualms
about chatting my guy up.

303
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:14,206
This is fun,
it's like "Password".

304
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,986
Keep talking, I'll jump in
when I get a clue what the hell
you're talking about.

305
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,855
God knows about
my poker game.

306
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,352
You think I told him?

307
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,989
Either that or I start
going to church every Sunday.

308
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,492
That would mess
with my bowling league.

309
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:30,766
House, aside from yelling at him
to get back to his room,
I've never spoken to your patient.

310
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:38,491
MRI shows an abnormal area.

311
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,477
Tuberous sclerosis.

312
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,772
It's the right neighborhood.

313
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:43,987
Accounts for all the symptoms.

314
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:45,187
All of them.

315
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:48,347
Leading cortical tuber's
identifiable.

316
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,392
We can do this surgically.

317
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,410
Tell our patient congratulations.

318
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:55,790
Soon these chats with God
will be a thing of the past.

319
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,917
Tie goes to the mortal.

320
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:16,793
Did you know the Catholic Church
keeps a doctor at Lourdes?

321
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,735
He hears
the same thing every day.

322
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:23,001
But out of the thousands of cases of
people who have claimed to feel better,

323
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:28,103
the Catholic Church has only
recognized a handful as miracles.

324
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:30,666
But they do recognize a handful.

325
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,016
Well, they're a church.

326
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:35,772
It's what they do.

327
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:43,354
Look, for the past couple of years,
the world's been getting smaller.

328
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:46,000
Eight months, six months.

329
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,006
I watch a trailer for a movie...

330
00:19:50,183 --> 00:19:53,969
and I think, am I gonna be here
when that comes out?

331
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:58,893
But maybe there is still
a horizon out there.

332
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:00,397
You know, maybe...

333
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,248
Maybe I can make plans
for a year from now.

334
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:06,240
Two years.

335
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:10,498
I like the view.

336
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:17,296
The view is a lie.
And if you believe it,
you're going to crash so hard...

337
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:21,629
Let me take
new images of your liver.

338
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,788
You can't accept
that it could be true.

339
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:27,664
Well, if it is true,
you shouldn't be afraid of proving it.

340
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:35,090
Tuberous Sclerosis
is a genetic disorder.

341
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:38,408
It causes small, benign tumors
to grow in various parts of the body.

342
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:40,021
In this case, the brain.

343
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,670
You said benign.

344
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:45,580
They probably are.
But benign or not,
they're not in a good location.

345
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:47,072
We need to remove them.

346
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:48,615
You're talking brain surgery?

347
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:51,557
His symptoms are getting worse
which means the tumors are growing.

348
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:56,857
Surgery will correct it all.
The chemical imbalance, the seizures,
the auditory hallucinations.

349
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:58,623
Hallucinations?

350
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,175
Without the surgery,
it's just gonna get worse.

351
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:04,148
It might even be fatal.

352
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:08,935
With the surgery, your son should be
a perfectly normal 15-year-old boy.

353
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm not normal.

354
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:22,987
I need you to talk to my patient.

355
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,562
I'll get this one.

356
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:28,475
Why do I have the feeling
you're plotting world domination?

357
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,927
Moses is refusing surgery.

358
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:32,150
You have a gift.

359
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:35,280
People thank you for
telling them they're gonna die.

360
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:40,432
If I can get him to agree to surgery,
I want in on the poker game.

361
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:44,156
You would let this kid die
just to get into a stupid game?

362
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,575
You'd let him die
just to keep me out?

363
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:54,036
Hi.

364
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,301
I'm Dr. Wilson.

365
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,136
I knew
they'd send somebody else.

366
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,147

368
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:09,938
Can I ask why you don't
want the tumors removed?

369
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,682
God put them there
for a reason.

370
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:15,030
You think God needs a telephone
in your head to talk to you?

371
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:17,601
Isn't he everywhere?
It's not a long distance call, is it?

372
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,104
This is the way
God does things.

373
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,546
Through natural law.
If he went around doing
big, flashy miracles all the time,

374
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:26,028
- nobody would need faith.
- How come everyone else needs faith,

375
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:29,533
but you just get the guy
screaming his existence in your ear?

376
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:33,382
Your turn.

377
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:40,098
Do you think
God wants you to die?

378
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:43,827
This  is the way that the Lord
often is with his chosen ones.

379
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:47,181
He gives the most trials
to those that he loves the most.

380
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,567
How sweet.
You abdicate your authority.

381
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:55,402
Avoid those tricky parental issues
like whether to let him drive at 16.
Just let him die at 15.

382
00:22:55,544 --> 00:23:03,849
So you believe
your son is... um, a saint.

383
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,165
The way I understand it,

384
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:09,165
one of the hallmarks
of a saint is humility.

385
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:13,497
Someone with true humility would
consider the possibility that...

386
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:16,364
God hadn't chosen him
for that kind of honor.

387
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:20,346
He'd consider
the possibility that...

388
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,609
he just had an illness.

389
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,462
You have a gift
for manipulation.

390
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,191
I listen. I have an actual
conversation with people.

391
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:37,801
Which, shockingly, does raise
the odds they'll be cooperative.

392
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:38,952
That's what I'm saying.

393
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:42,431
You read that kid, and
you manipulated the hell out of him.

00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:59,557
Most people in your situation
just have their careers to worry about.

514
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:01,947
You've got that
and divine retribution.

515
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:02,753
Tell them.

516
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:05,765
Tell me how it happened,
and I'll tell them whatever you want.

517
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,833
She'd had a bad day.
Pain-wise.

518
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:14,168
Her ride didn't show up
to take her home.

519
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:15,649
So you offered.

520
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,653
Yeah.

521
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,490
She didn't have any groceries.

522
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:21,288
She was too sick to go out. I...

523
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,059
figured I could afford
to take a half hour.

524
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:29,839
- Pick her up and few things.
- And stay and make sure she's okay.

525
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:30,878
Yeah.

526
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:33,048
And never leave.

527
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,639
You told me
you got an apartment.

528
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:38,689
But you moved in with her.

529
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:40,533
You lied to me.

530
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:41,897
Tell them.

531
00:32:43,952 --> 00:32:47,270
His name is not Wilson, and
he's screwed up worse than I am.

532
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:50,458
Okay, yes, I lied to you.
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:55,450
Half the doctors who specialize in oncology
turn into burnt out cases. But you,

534
00:32:55,534 --> 00:32:57,320
you eat neediness.

535
00:32:57,397 --> 00:32:58,988
Lucky for you.

536
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:03,211
Thanks for the game, guys.
I don't think I'll be coming back.

537
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:07,687
You're a functional vampire.
Sure, you're heroic, useful to society.

538
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:09,850
But only because it feeds you.

539
00:33:12,514 --> 00:33:15,002
There's nothing worth stealing,
so don't even look.

540
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:25,530
You don't just have a fetish
for needy people, you marry them!

541
00:33:25,615 --> 00:33:26,802
- Here we go!
- You mean it!

542
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:30,566
And then time passes, suddenly
they're not so needy anymore.

543
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:32,251
Your fault.

544
00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:33,932
You've been there
for them too much.

545
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:37,546
They're getting
healthy, independent.
And that's just ugly.

546
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:41,183
God, you must be
pissed at God right now.
Making her all happy.

547
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,196
Why are you doing this?

548
00:33:42,265 --> 00:33:43,904
Because you're being stupid.

549
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:44,897
[Laughs]

550
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:47,375
You know what you're risking
by sleeping with a patient.

551
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:51,362
Oh, that's crap. You're not mad
because I'm risking my job.

552
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:53,234
You're not even mad
because I lied to you.

553
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:55,520
You're mad because I lied to you,
and you couldn't tell.

554
00:33:55,605 --> 00:33:57,252
Yeah, you got me nailed.

555
00:33:57,331 --> 00:34:00,550
Yeah, that's why you didn't
want me in your poker game.

556
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,466
Because when it comes
to being in control,

557
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,176
Gregory House leaves
our faith healer kid in the dust.

558
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,897
And that's why
religious belief annoys you.

559
00:34:08,022 --> 00:34:10,123
Because if the universe
operates by abstract rules,

560
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,414
you can learn them,
you can protect yourself.

561
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:15,880
If a supreme being exists,
he can squash you any time he wants.

562
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,055
He knows where I am.

563
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:20,521
[Phone rings]

564
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:21,806
I think it's yours.

565
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,127
Yeah.

566
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,564
I'll be right there.

567
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,748
Jesus is spiking a fever.
He's delusional.

568
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:35,762
Tuberous sclerosis
doesn't cause fever.

569
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:36,793
I know.

570
00:34:37,472 --> 00:34:38,964
I'll drive.

571
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:48,205
Pick any random guy off the street.
Bring him in here,

572
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:52,338
examine him exhaustively.
You will find at least
three things wrong with him.

573
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,781
This kid has
tuberous sclerosis.

574
00:34:54,953 --> 00:34:57,400
- A mild case.
- But his tumors are growing.

575
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:59,664
We assumed that
the tumors were growing.

576
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:02,296
'Cause he's getting sicker.
But he could have grown old and died

577
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:04,189
and never known about them
if he hadn't come here.

578
00:35:04,256 --> 00:35:07,509
We were looking for
something that was more or less
in the right part of the brain.

579
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:11,231
It's like we found someone
standing over a dead body holding a gun.

580
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,660
We arrested them,
didn't look any further.
Well, sometimes

581
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:17,560
people really do just stumble
into a murder scene.

582
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:19,901
His fever is 103 and rising.

583
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:23,461
If we don't do anything,
he's gonna be chatting with God
face to face real soon.

584
00:35:23,525 --> 00:35:26,741
Fevers don't come from
a long-term underlying condition.

585
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:31,508
He's a garden variety religious nut
who happens to have an infection.

586
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:34,034
It's lumbar puncture time.

587
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,313
No.

588
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,375
No, God told me
no more of man's medicine.

589
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:42,467
If we have faith in him,
he'll make me well.

590
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:43,582
It's just a test.

591
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,350
We just wanna
find out what's wrong.

592
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,135
God knows what's wrong.
God will take care of it.

593
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:52,582
He's delirious, and he's a minor.
This is your decision, and not his.

594
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:57,134
The kingdom of heaven is
like a treasure hidden in field
which when a man finds, he hides.

595
00:35:57,243 --> 00:36:00,429
And for joy he goes and sells
all he owns and buys that field.

596
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:02,953
Buy all the land you want!
Don't blow your brains out.

597
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:05,862
You're watching your son kill himself!
He's out of his mind with fever--

598
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:10,914
Dad, if your faith is weak,
I will fail.

599
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:14,078
I need you.

600
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,725
I'm sorry.

601
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,091
You don't even know
what's wrong with him.

602
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:27,502
God knows the answer.

603
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,963
And I would rather leave it
in His hands than yours.

604
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:40,855
Wilson.

605
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,239
I need you to do your thing.

606
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:47,109
You do know that I don't
actually have magical powers.

607
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:48,483
I have faith.

608
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:50,974
You're better off trying to slip
some antibiotics into a meal...

609
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:53,700
Which antibiotics?
We don't know what infection he's got.

610
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:55,562
- Go as broad as you can.
- Forget it.

611
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,983
Our best hope
is your silver tongue.

612
00:36:58,084 --> 00:36:59,903
What if it's not an infection?

613
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,826
Where you not paying attention when
I was doing my murder scene metaphor?

614
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,860
What if the tuberous sclerosisis guilty?

615
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:06,778
It had the gun in its hand,
it was standing over...

616
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,060
Doesn't cause fever.

617
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,307
It causes everything else.

618
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:11,590
What if the fever's
the innocent bystander?

619
00:37:11,657 --> 00:37:14,525
Fever could have been set off
by something he picked up anywhere.

620
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:16,843
Could have been
a bug he got here.

621
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:23,859
Or a bug he gave here.

622
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,298
He gave it to your patient.

623
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:33,010
That's why her tumor shrank.
The virus went after the cancer first.

624
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:35,390
Are you saying
a virus attacked her tumor?

625
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:40,891
For 200 years,
there have been reports of
wild viruses that target tumors.

626
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:44,538
Early 1900s,
an Italian medical journal wrote up
a woman with cervical cancer

627
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:46,373
who was injected
with a weak strain of rabies.

628
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:48,901
I have no idea why they did that,
but her tumor shrank.

629
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:50,857
You think
he gave her rabies?

630
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,579
One of the virus types
most prone to go after cancer cells
is herpes.

631
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:57,552
Herpes encephalitis.

632
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,148
It would fit.

633
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,413
Seizure, low sodium.
Even the blurred vision.

634
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:08,525
And it would mean if you're right,
Grace's cancer is coming back.

635
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,068
You're not gonna
be able to convince them.

636
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:13,982
They don't want any more tests.
They don't wanna...

637
00:38:14,046 --> 00:38:16,393
They can't argue
with the mark of Cain.

638
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,211
I'm not gonna
change my mind.

639
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:22,691
No more tests.
God knows the way.

640
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:25,344
Okay, let's start with his shirt.

641
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:28,302
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

642
00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:30,080
I'm on a mission from God.

643
00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:32,720
If you won't let me
undress you, then strip.

644
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,272
What's he doing?
What's going on?

645
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:36,659
That woman you helped,
you gave her a virus.

646
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:38,742
No, she's healed.
I have a gift--

647
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:41,497
A gift is jewelry, socks.

648
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:44,345
What you have
is herpes encephalitis.

649
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:48,856
The only way you could have transmitted it
is by scratching one of your own sores
and touching another person.

650
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,385
Herpes, that's something
you get from sex, right?

651
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:54,940
Either that or cold sores.
Your kid got it from the sex.

652
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:57,893
No, no sores.
No, my body is clean.

653
00:38:57,977 --> 00:38:59,597
They examined me
when I came in. No sores.

654
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:00,870
Herpes hides.

655
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:04,708
You have an outbreak, it goes away,
comes back, goes away. Strip!

656
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:07,033
You didn't have a sore
when you came in,
but you've got one now.

657
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:09,218
Dad, I've never ever--

658
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:13,326
You ever wonder why a perfect child
of God should feel so desperate

659
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:17,682
to purify his body that
he needed to scarf  down
a dozen gallons of water a day?

660
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:21,417
- Boyd, is he right?
- Dad, no, he's crazy.

661
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:24,030
Help me.
Dr. Wilson, help!

662
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:26,789
God said no medicine,
no procedures.

663
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,742
Taking off your clothes
doesn't count as either of those.

664
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,359
This one's your call.

665
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:36,708
Son...

666
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:39,663
Dad, you have to
have faith in me.

667
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:43,444
I have faith in the Lord.
You, I trust.

668
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:46,773
As much as you can
trust a teenage boy.

669
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:50,268
Take off your clothes.

670
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:03,656
Relax.

671
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:06,569
A few Hail Marys,
a little acyclovir.

672
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,348
You'll be picking up angels
again in no time.

673
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:28,852
Come in.

674
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:39,455
My father told me
I have to apologize to you.

675
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,921
Still hearing voices?

676
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:47,367
You're lucky.

677
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:51,825
You go through life with a certainty
that what you're doing is right.

678
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:55,983
I know
how comforting that is.

679
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:02,869
Good luck.

680
00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:21,000
You're not gonna
give me my final point?

681
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,083
You knew it was me?

682
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,068
Who else?

683
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:38,770
You don't think God
should get a point knocked off?

684
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:41,306
- The tumor shrank.
- Because of a virus.

685
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,454
Do you know what the odds are?
She had to have the right type of cancer.

686
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,030
He had to have the right type of virus.
The exposure had to be--

687
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,478
- She won the lottery.
- You say won the lottery,

688
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:52,983
- he says... miracle.
- Yeah,

689
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:58,049
the hand of God reached into this kid's pants,
made him have sex so he could scratch a rash,

690
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,797
stick his fingers
in some woman's face,
give her a few extra months.

691
00:42:01,948 --> 00:42:05,028
Come on, he's just another
liar and manipulator.

692
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:07,309
Well, nobody's
as perfectas you are.

693
00:42:09,786 --> 00:42:13,847
It is possible to believe in something
and still fail to live up to it.

694
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,771
So, how's your girlfriend?

695
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:35,715
She got a little extra time
out of this. Not a lot.

696
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,672
She didn't crash?

697
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:42,529
No... She says she's happier
when she believes in
something bigger than she is.

698
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:44,375
She still believes.

699
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:47,437
Faith.
She's going to Florence.

700
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,351
You moving out?

701
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:51,062
Yeah.

702
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:53,467
Moving back in with me?

703
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:58,234
I don't think
that's a great idea.

704
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,282
But we're okay.

705
00:43:03,343 --> 00:43:05,899
House, you are...

706
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,028
as God made you.
