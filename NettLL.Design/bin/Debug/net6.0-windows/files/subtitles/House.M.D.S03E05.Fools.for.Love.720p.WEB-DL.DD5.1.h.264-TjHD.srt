Here you go.

00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,836

will kill you. See?

(BELL JINGLING)

00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,080
WAITRESS: Good night.

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,319
Time to make the donuts.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,582
Hands in the air! Right now!
Get them up!

7
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,990
Move out here. Get up!
Move out here! Let's go!

8
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,426
Move it.
Put them up!

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,430
Purses and wallets
on the counter, right now.

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,661
Yo! Your watches,
your jewelry!
Take it all off!

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,705
Yeah, all right.
Keep the girl.
Keep the girl.

12
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,797
Yeah.

13
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,832
We're moving to
the back room. Let's go!

14
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,934
Go! Let's go!
Move it!

15
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,104
Go on! Not you.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,542
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

17
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,809
She's staying right here.

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,145
You're not going to do this.

19
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,741
Whoa, whoa, kid.

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,121
No, Jeremy.
Please, just do
what they say. Please!

21
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,285
Okay. Okay.
Yeah. Move!

You thought I was
going to let you
hurt my wife?

Hey! Hey, sir. Your wife!

(GASPING)

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,674
What did he do to her?

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,147
Nothing.

29
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,387
Tracy!

30
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,654
CAMERON: Twenty-year-old
married
African-American female.

31
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,856
Couldn't breathe.
Anaphylaxis-like
throat swelling.

32
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,660
Children?
You think pregnancy
would explain...

33
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,893
Explains the marriage.

34
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,401
Who the hell
gets married at 20?

35
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,936
I'm guessing,
people in love?

36
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,097
Show me a 20-year-old
who's not in love.

37
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,267
You get married at 20,
you're going to be shocked at
who you're living with at 30.

38
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,311
CAMERON: It's not allergies.
Negative on the skin test.

39
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,403
Four days of antihistamines
and steroids.

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,913
Who's he talking to?
What?

41
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,179
It's got an ass.
Technically, that
makes it a "who."

42
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,779
New nurse in peds.
Wendy something.

43
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,379
Swelling just started
to go down...

44
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,856
You seen her here before?

45
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,157
A couple times. I tried
following her home,
but she gave me the slip.

46
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,086
Swelling's...

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,189
(LAUGHING)

48
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,231
You think that's funny?

49
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,364
Ask him about the time
he sabotaged my cane.

50
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,074
Are you serious?

51
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,073
There was a point to it.
Wendy, this is House.

52
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,412
Something about not getting
too uppity with normal folks
who walk good.

53
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,212
You're everything I'd heard.
Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,183
Why so rude?

55
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,752
You've sprinted through
three bad marriages

56
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,197
into an affair with
a dying patient.
Now a naughty nurse?

57
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,997
How many more failed
relationships are we both
gonna have to deal with

58
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,594
before you learn to
love yourself?

59
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,934
And I mean that
in the literal way.

60
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,497
It's amazing how you can
not only know
it's a relationship,

61
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,536
but that it's a
bad relationship, based on
nothing but nothing.

62
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,911
I know you.

63
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,973
I'm not with her,
not even trying.

64
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,416
You're lying to me.
That's interesting.

65
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,956
Well, as long as
it's interesting.

66
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,988
Swelling is...
Why is she hanging out here?

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,895
Anyone interested
in what happened
with the swelling?

68
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,763
She's in peds.
That's the next wing over.

69
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,893
If you're wondering if
Wilson's dating her,
ask Wilson.

70
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,030
Clearly he did, and
Wilson denied it. And
House doesn't believe it.

71
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,234
That's gotta hurt. That's why
it pays to have more
than one friend, House.

72
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,277
If he's not hitting that,
why is she here?

73
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,473
Because I'm hitting that
and it's totally hot.

74
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,540
Swelling took four days
to resolve.

75
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,676
Patient has unexplained
intense abdominal pains.

76
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,413
So explain them.

77
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,682
Wake me when they've done
an exploratory laparotomy.

78
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,348
Anybody know her?
Know her story?

79
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,857
Up and at 'em.

80
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,450
They did a laparotomy.

81
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,257
Liver, bowel, gall bladder,
appendix, all clean.

82
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,195
Belly pain plus
throat swelling.

83
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,861
She was in some sort of
assault, right?
Simple neck trauma.

84
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,564
It says no one touched
her neck, and if they did,
it would resolve by now.

85
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,539
Didn't need to touch her.
Some guy coughed
on her, right?

86
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,507
He's in jail and
he's completely healthy,

87
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,739
except for the broken head
he got from
the beating he took.

88
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,973
There's pot on her tox screen.

89
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,744
Salmonella from the pot
would explain
the stomach pains.

90
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,580
It's a stretch.
She'd have a fever.

91
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,349
She's on steroids
for the swelling,
therefore no fever.

92
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,889
And the smoking
explains the throat.

93
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,788
Sorry, take it back.
That's a stretch.

94
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,656
Got a better idea?

95
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,523
Then stretch away.

96
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,691
Start her on fluoroquinolone
for the salmonella.

97
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,071
I was waiting
two hours out there.

98
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,510
Fascinating.

99
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,548
Have you considered a career
as a memoirist?

100
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,049
Let's see it.

101
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,277
You don't introduce yourself?

102
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,878
Sorry, I thought
you were waiting two hours.

103
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,479
Didn't know
you wanted to chat.

104
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,458
Hi, I'm Greg.
How about that
local sports team?

105
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,625
It's not an infection.

106
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,723
How can you tell without...

107
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,028
You want me to touch you?

108
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,966
It's your private place.

109
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,302
You're chewing nicotine gum,
which causes dehydration,
which causes wear and tear.

110
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,343
Try a lubricant,
or foreplay if you're cheap.

111
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,773
Just take a swab
and get it tested, okay?

112
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:51,510
Sorry, I already met
this month's quota of useless
tests for stubborn idiots.

113
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,411
You're rude.

114
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,091
Wow. You're like a
detective or something.

115
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,060
And you're smart
and you're funny.

116
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,691
But you are bitter
and you're lonely,

117
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,496
so you treat everyone around
like they're idiots,

118
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,701
and you get away with it
'cause of your cane.

119
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,478
Please stop. It's hard to
write through the haze
of bitter tears.

120
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,810
But you're not actually
getting away with it.

121
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,751
Last nurse you made fun of,
she probably slipped some
crap into your coffee.

122
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,256
Yeah, I asked for
decrapinated coffee.

123
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,293
Treat people like jerks,
you get treated like a jerk.

124
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,687
Thank you.

125
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,689
Bend over.

126
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,458
You kidding me?
If you have an infection,
you'd have a fever.

127
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,056
But you're chewing
nicotine gum,

128
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,725
which messes with the weather
in your mouth,

129
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,202
so I need to
vacation elsewhere.

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,104
(WINCING)

131
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,345
And wait till I put
the thermometer in.

132
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,517
You break it, you bought it.

133
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,226
Leaving early today.

134
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,295
Do you ever get that thing
where you're sure
you forgot something,

135
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,633
but you can't figure out what?

136
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,906
Guess it can't be
that important.

137
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,342
Salmonella is a bacterial
infection that you can
get from pot plants.

138
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,437
It causes stomach pain.

139
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,674
And my throat?

140
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,649
The thinking is it's
an inflammatory reaction
to the smoking.

141
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,380
How much would you need
to smoke for your throat
to go nuts like that?

142
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,682
Most cases, a lot.

143
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,222
We don't smoke a lot.

144
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,852
Let's just start
the treatment.

145
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,859
You think we're liars,
as well as druggies?

146
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,418
Actually, I'm wondering if
you'd mind getting her
a cup of ice chips.

147
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,260
You're not gonna get
any different answer from her.

148
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,698
No, no. He can stay.

149
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,827
No offense, but this place
is scary. I feel better
when he's around.

150
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,201
Tracy, I need to talk to you.

151
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,069
We don't do a lot of drugs.

152
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,631
I need to know
your answers aren't
being pressured.

153
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,737
Look, if you think the
antibiotics are a good idea,
you can give them to me.

154
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,773
Okay. Worst-case scenario,
it'll help us rule out
a few things.

155
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,244
He's a good guy.

156
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,413
He just has a hard time
holding in his emotions.

157
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,252
You don't have to
apologize for me.

158
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,951
That mean you're
going to do it for yourself?

159
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,755
I got nothing to
apologize for.

160
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,125
He's young.

161
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,757
Itchy.

162
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,592
HOUSE: Allergic reaction
to the fluoroquinolone.

163
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,230
We should switch to
a different antibiotic.
Why?

164
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,104
We can't treat the
salmonella unless...
Salmonella?

165
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,335
That was a total stretch.

166
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,344
Oh, man, why does that
sound so familiar?

167
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,970
You think it's 'cause
I said it an hour ago?

168
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,845
Then it was a dumb thing
to say. Now it's smart.

169
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,512
She's got the rash, so we know
she's unusually susceptible
to allergic reactions,

170
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,849
so that's what brought her in.

171
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,583
Probably the peanut butter
in her sandwich.

172
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,919
Stick test was negative
for peanuts.

173
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,687
That's because you
foolishly tested her while
she was lying down.

174
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,992
Exercise-based anaphylaxis?
I think that
requires exercise.

175
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,656
When her throat closed,
they'd just got done eating.

176
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,960
Not even competitive eating.

177
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,435
And getting robbed.
That always gets
my heart rate up.

178
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,937
Give her the same food
she ate at the diner

179
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,063
and stick her
on the treadmill.

180
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,507
Better yet, put a gun
to her head,
threaten to rape her.

181
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,204
You don't think
I'm going to get a response?

182
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,677
No.

183
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,338
You're on. Fifty bucks.

184
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,677
I'm not betting
on a patient's...

185
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,547
A hundred bucks.
If you say so.

186
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,862
<i>Tracy, I'm increasing</i>
<i>the speed a little.</i>

187
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,295
My stomach really hurts.

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,992
Jeremy, you out there?
Talk to... Talk...

189
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,436
You're doing great.
Isn't this enough?

190
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,496
We're not getting
any allergic response yet.

191
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,871
Shut it off.

192
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,931
We don't complete the test,

193
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,671
my boss will just
come down here
and do it himself.

194
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,042
You do not want that.

195
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,705
She's in pain. Look at her.

196
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,476
I don't want to have to
ask you to leave.

197
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,848
You're gonna ask me to leave?
Are you kidding me?
This is my wife!

198
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,114
You guys aren't helping her.
You're just hurting her. What?

199
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,782
You guys have all
this equipment here,
and you're not doing anything!

200
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,848
You guys can't even
figure out what's...

201
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,257
(GROANING)

202
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,453
God, it hurts.

203
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,429
Where?
In my stomach. And my chest.

204
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,228
Oh, God!
It's Foreman.
Get me a wheelchair.

205
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,170
FOREMAN: He's as sick as
she is now.

206
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,437
I told you it wouldn't work.

207
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,035
It worked on
the wrong patient.

208
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,707
We could spend all day
arguing right or wrong.

209
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,806
Give me the 100 bucks.

210
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,316
We didn't bet.

211
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,979
We could spend all day
arguing whether we bet or not.

212
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,318
Give me the 100 bucks.

213
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,293
Come on, Foreman, pay up.
He won. Or we could just
never finish the DDX.

214
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,828
Husband's test showed no MI,
no aortic dissection.
It's not his heart.

215
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,301
It's just nonspecific
chest and abdominal pain.

216
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,773
So, psychosomatic?
Panic attack?

217
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,270
Pain persisted after
he got lorazepam and morphine.

218
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,972
Whose locker is that?

219
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,207
Mine.

220
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,345
Chest, stomach, throat.

221
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,251
What does it all mean?
We're in the nurses'
locker room.

222
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,753
I know that.

223
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,488
Oh, that is so annoying.

224
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,791
Wilson's girlfriend's
left her stuff in
my locker again.

225
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,627
Great. I hadn't committed
any felonies yet today.

226
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,463
Relax. You know who
they're going to blame.

227
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,003
House, you want to mess
with Wilson, no problem.

228
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,504
But you got no reason
to screw around with...

229
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,802
Can we get back
to the medicine?
FOREMAN: Okay.

230
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,536
Why assume one disease?
His chest, her throat.

231
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,841
So it's just a coincidence
that they've both got
crippling stomach pains?

232
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,315
Wow, they really are
a great couple.
So much in common.

233
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,847
One blue shoe.
What do you think that means?

234
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,822
It means you're insane.
Wilson's not dating her.

235
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,914
You feeling luckier?

236
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,481
It doesn't matter
what I answer.

237
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,788
Two hundred it is.

238
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,661
If they're married and caught
the same disease,
then it means they...

239
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,562
Brochure to a jazz festival
in the Poconos this weekend.

240
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,696
Wilson likes jazz.
Foreman, pay the man.

241
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:25,335
Four, five, six novels,
no music.
What does that mean?

242
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,469
She's literate.

243
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,275
It means she spends
her leisure time reading,
not listening.

244
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,784
She'd only want to go
and watch jazz if
the other person wanted to go.

245
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,980
She has a martyr complex,
issues of inferiority.

246
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,579
Married couple, same disease.

247
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,216
They either got it
from each other or
in the same place.

248
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,419
Infectious or environmental?

249
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,286
What we have to do is
check out parasites,
viruses, bacteria, fungi,

250
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:50,768
prions, radiation,
toxins, chemicals.
Or it's Internet porn-related.

251
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,237
I'll check the Internet.
You guys cover
the rest of the stuff.

252
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,403
If they can live here without
killing each other,
they must really be in love.

253
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,743
It's tiny.

254
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,081
How come it's taking you
so long to search it?

255
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,015
Box of condoms in his jacket.

256
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,785
I know you're poor now,
but buy your own.

257
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,792
She's on the pill.

258
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,987
Why would he need condoms?

259
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,291
No, no, no. Put that back.

260
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,559
Why?

261
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,466
We show that to House,
he'll just call the guy
a cheating bastard.

262
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,662
Look how he is with Wilson.

263
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,898
He'd be right.
Could be an STD.

264
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,339
One that doesn't give them
any symptoms in
their sexual organs?

265
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,071
They never mentioned anything.
Maybe they're embarrassed.

266
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,169
What else could it be?

267
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,215
You think they just like
the sexy feel of latex
against their genitals?

268
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,582
Maybe the wife
just wants to be
extra-cautious.

269
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,644
Come on.
You really believe that?
Yeah.

270
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,418
Good. Then I'm sure
you'll have no problem
convincing House.

271
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,995
That cheating bastard!

272
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,496
He loves her.

273
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,830
Right, I bet he told you
that she's the
love of his life.

274
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,425
People lie. I get it.

275
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,995
But they don't go up against
two armed gunmen to save
someone unless they...

276
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:06,636
There's a reason that
we don't let kids vote or
drink or work in salt mines.

277
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,441
They're idiots.

278
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,951
Twenty-year-olds fall in and
out of love more often than
they change their oil filters,

279
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,178
which they should do
more often.

280
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,483
Sorry. Ridiculous of me
to draw a conclusion

281
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,420
based on actually
observing them.

282
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,288
I should have just depended on
your misanthropic view
of human nature.

283
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,385
Gonorrhea explains
all their symptoms.

284
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,555
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome
for her belly pain,

285
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,566
costochondritis and bladder
infection for his chest
and abdominal pain.

286
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,658
Good.

287
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,637
Now go rub their lying,
cheating privates
with a cotton swab.

288
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,901
Why would you want to
look at our...

289
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,813
Is this because
of the condoms?

290
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,444
You found them in his jacket,
figured he was hiding
something from me.

291
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,249
I thought I was pregnant
last month. It kind of
freaked me out.

292
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,688
I'm way too young
to have kids.

293
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,885
So you just wanted
to be extra-cautious?

294
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,327
Wish one of us had figured
that out, stuck to his guns.

295
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,659
We've still gotta
check you both.

296
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,597
She's the only girlfriend
I've ever had.

297
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,191
She's the love of...
Please don't say it.

298
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,429
I can't say I love my wife?

299
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,697
We're still going to test you.

300
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,068
What is it? I'm white?

301
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,697
Yeah, that's it.

302
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,470
Jer, I wish you would stop it.
You're really embarrassing.

303
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,535
Everybody thinks
they're so liberal, but I see
how they look at us.

304
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,343
White and black,
especially black.

305
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,414
I'm sorry, Trace,
but it's true.

306
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,317
Great. Prove us all wrong.

307
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,480
Stupid...

308
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,685
No scarring, no purulent
discharge, and the
NAATs were negative.

309
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,786
They don't have an STD.
(LOUDLY) What's that you say?

310
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,263
You've got a problem
with interracial couples?

311
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,663
Thank you, Chase. No!

312
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,564
Have any of your shorties
ever been whities?

313
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,695
I'm not sure I understand
your ghetto slang, Dr. House.

314
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,706
How many black women
have you dated, by the way?

315
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,904
I don't care about color,
as long as they can help me
breed a superior race.

316
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,539
Yeah, my exes have usually
been black. So what?

317
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,709
It's not a racial thing.
It's cultural. I have more
in common with them.

318
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,482
Like I assume you only date
emotionally stunted bigots.

319
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,817
Sorry, you're right.
That kind of prejudice
is totally fine.

320
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,329
The abdominal pain's
getting worse. We've had to
up their morphine twice.

321
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,590
Take the wife off
the steroids.

322
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,393
She spikes a fever,
we'll know it's an infection.

323
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,991
She doesn't,
it's environmental.

324
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,906
He got off easy.
I almost gave him
a colonoscopy.

325
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,539
That was one of
the stupidest things
you have ever done,

326
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,082
and there is heavy
competition for...

327
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,515
What are you doing?

328
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,712
You only ate
half your breakfast.

329
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,618
Feeling a little sick
this morning?

330
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,816
I'm not pregnant.
They burnt my omelet.

331
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,415
You need to apologize
to this guy.

332
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,017
I am a man of principle.

333
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,893
I don't care how much
time and money
it costs you to defend me.

334
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,226
He wants to kill you.

335
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,700
No empty coffee cups.
Off the caffeine.
Good for baby.

336
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,863
Cups are in the
other wastebasket.
Baby's in your mind.

337
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,430
You can berate patients
all you want.

338
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,966
Shoving objects into
their rectums is assault.

339
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,808
Pay attention to me.

340
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,183
Sorry, that would make
it harder to ignore you.

341
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,378
Can't ignore that rapidly
expanding first-trimester
ass, though.

342
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,115
Sometimes an ass
is just an ass.

343
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,658
You are not always right,
House. Apologize to the guy.

344
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,635
What are you doing here?
Stay away from my son.

345
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,703
How did you find us?

346
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,743
Stay away from that girl.

347
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,806
(SCREAMING)

348
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,116
Please! Please! Please!
You leave him alone!

349
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,353
What happened?
She's dreaming.
She started yelling.

350
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,953
You're breaking Jeremy's arm.
Please!
No one's hurting him.

351
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,295
Baby, it's me. It's Jeremy.
Tracy, Tracy.

352
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:54,204
She's okay. Baby,
it was just a bad dream.
Everything's okay.

353
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,504
Tracy. Tracy?

354
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,511
It was an acute delirium.

355
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,523
Well, she's talking, right?
I mean, she's coming
out of it.

356
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,560
No, she's not really talking,
just making sounds.

357
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,458
Okay. When's she
gonna come out?

358
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,760
Jeremy, she's in a coma.

359
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,908
<i>So her vitals</i>
<i>are pretty stable,</i>

360
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,809
but her response to stimuli
is getting weaker,

361
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,676
which means the coma's
getting worse.

362
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,215
Her brain is slowly
shutting down.

363
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,875
Can I see her?

364
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,353
We're getting some more images
to check for masses
or infections.

365
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,219
(GROANING)

366
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,383
I'll increase your morphine.

367
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,622
Her hallucination.

368
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,632
If you knew what it was,
would that make
any difference?

369
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,958
Medically, I mean.

370
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,730
Not usually.

371
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,329
Some cases, the form of
a hallucination can tell us

372
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,136
what part of the brain
is being hit.

373
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,972
I think it was about my dad.

374
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,036
Your dad was
breaking your arm?

375
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,949
He was a drunk,
pill-popping racist.

376
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,918
He caught me sneaking
into her house
when we were 13.

377
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,856
She lived next door.

378
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,252
He broke my arm
and threatened her.

379
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,390
We ran off when we were 16.

380
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,295
You still in touch with him?

381
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,501
He killed himself
a couple years ago.

382
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,239
Oh, it's not medical.
I just thought blacks
were the racist ones.

383
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,352
Some generalized
edema throughout,

384
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,120
and areas of increased signal
here, here, here and here.

385
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,458
Damn, all over her brain stem.

386
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,430
Could be plaques,
maybe hyperdensities
from the edema.

387
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,194
Or tumors or anything.

388
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,862
We add brain involvement
to the chest, stomach, throat,
what do we got?

389
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,929
Didn't spike a fever
when we took her
off the steroids,

390
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,133
so it's not an infection.
Leaving environmental.

391
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,473
What flavor?
Environmental doesn't
make sense, either.

392
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,341
If it was a toxin,
we'd see it in their livers.

393
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,244
None of the neighbors
are sick, no coworkers.

394
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,373
They both got it.

395
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,350
That means infection or
environmental, and since
it's not an infection...

396
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,683
What if they
didn't both get it?

397
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,780
Maybe we got our basic
assumption wrong and
it's two different diseases.

398
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,315
Maybe we didn't and
it's sarcoidosis.

399
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,828
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious
or environmental.

400
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,764
Tell that to the clusters
of sarcoidosis cases.

401
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,893
Firefighters and residents
of pine tar forests?

402
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,201
I did see these two
putting out that blaze
in the Pine Barrens.

403
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,969
If sarcoidosis has
two environmental causes,

404
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,839
it has environmental causes.

405
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,574
We just don't know all
of them yet. Husband's chest.

406
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,679
He has slightly enlarged
hilar lymph nodes.

407
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,853
Sarcoidosis explains
almost all of their symptoms,

408
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,913
including her getting worse
off the steroids.

409
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,652
Doesn't explain
his throat swelling.

410
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,091
That's what "almost" means.

411
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,594
90% of sarcoidosis cases
have lung scarring.

412
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,790
Oh, 90?
Oh, "almost"?

413
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,826
Fine.

414
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,333
Consult a specialist.

415
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,440
If this is more
dating advice...

416
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,486
Love to gossip,
but I got work to do.

417
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,818
Is this sarcoidosis?

418
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,555
It's pretty nonspecific.

419
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,859
It could be granulomas,
could be plaques.
What's this?

420
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,924
Oh! Oh! You stole
Wendy's personnel file?

421
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:49,770
In a way, aren't we all guilty
of bribing the janitor to take
her file and give it to me?

422
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,934
Yes, I take my share
of the blame, but society's...

423
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,705
First of all,
I'm not dating her.

424
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,247
She is so wrong for you.

425
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,342
You know she filed a form
so the hospital would
take extra withholding?

426
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,649
Who does that?
She's much too cautious
for me.

427
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,155
Point taken.
I'll start dating her

428
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:08,124
so I can break up with her
and start dating a stripper.

429
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,253
You're a miserable jerk
who can't stand to be alone.

430
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,322
I didn't try to break up
your marriages.
You did that yourself.

431
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,698
My marriages were so crappy,
I was spending all
my time with you.

432
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,067
Your real fear
is me having
a good relationship.

433
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,265
Yes, it keeps me up at night.

434
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,208
That and the Loch Ness
monster, global warming,
evolution

435
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,438
and other fictional concepts.

436
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,881
Although, big romantic weekend
in the Poconos could
change everything.

437
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,484
You don't... No.

438
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,188
I don't think
it's sarcoidosis.

439
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,922
He says it's sarcoidosis.

440
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,557
Start them both
on methotrexate.

441
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,692
And if you're wrong?

442
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,365
If Wilson's wrong,
we'll biopsy her
just to be sure.

443
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,805
Her brain stem?

444
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,275
Brain damage is
not only possible,
it's likely.

445
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:03,371
Good point.
Let's biopsy something safer,
like her shoes.

446
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,853
The husband.
He'd have to give consent.
He can't right now.

447
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,889
Why? Does this guy write
with his stomach?

448
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,686
He has a conflict of interest.

449
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,592
It's not his brain we're
cutting open, but he
still gets all the benefit.

450
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,958
He'd do it
just to save himself.

451
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,462
Or save her.

452
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,930
She's the love of his life,
remember?

453
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,261
He never said that.

454
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,462
She needs a guardian ad litem.
I can't let you do this.

455
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,097
Well, how are you going
to stop me? Call Cuddy?

456
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,606
Cameron's right.
There's a conflict.

457
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,039
No, there isn't.

458
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,907
Not unless one of them
wants to die a horrible,
painful death.

459
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,446
I'm sure the guardian
will figure that out.

460
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,209
In a couple days.

461
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,842
Will the guardian convince
the disease to hold off
eating her brain

462
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,386
until we can get
the legalities worked out?

463
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,252
I just don't want some
plaintiff's lawyer owning
my hospital.

464
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,154
Legalities help.

465
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,352
Speaking of which,
did you get your
thermometer back yet?

466
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,829
We had a nice chat.
Did you know he's a Rotarian?

467
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,292
Listen, she'll die
without the biopsy.

468
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,864
I need to cover
the hospital's ass.
You're too biased.

469
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,635
I send you in there,
you'll steamroll over him.

470
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,575
Something goes wrong,
he'll sue us for
not disclosing the risks.

471
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,442
Then have Wilson
talk to the husband.

472
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,880
Wilson kills people
left and right.
No one ever sues him.

473
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,514
Fine, but only if
you apologize
to the clinic guy.

474
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,055
No. Probably better
to just let that couple die.

475
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,819
I don't care if you mean it.
Just do it.

476
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,098
Unfortunately, we don't see
any way around a biopsy.

477
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,690
We'll do all we can
to minimize any damage.

478
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:30,962
No.

479
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,766
The methotrexate isn't showing
any effects yet.

480
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,897
You could both be...

481
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,565
She's brilliant.

482
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,969
All A's in college
while working full-time.

483
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,736
I can't do that to her.

484
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,044
And if you both die,
you think she'd want that?

485
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,185
Do it on me instead.

486
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,620
It's not in your brain.
It will be.

487
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,488
It's the same disease,
right? Do it then.

488
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,887
She could die
before you show the symptoms.

489
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,794
Then stop treating me.

490
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,562
Great job.
Why didn't you just
shoot him in the head?

491
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,763
Hold on.
That gives me an idea.

492
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,398
You know what could
save this couple?
Lots of misdirected sarcasm.

493
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:12,204
They're dead! Yelling at you
might prevent you
from screwing up...

494
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,505
I didn't screw up.
I did my job.

495
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,011
Your job was
to get me the biopsy.

496
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,945
No, it was to present
the patient with his options.

497
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,880
Two options,
biopsy or no biopsy.

498
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,578
He chose a third,
no treatment.
How do you even do that?

499
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,247
Remember when you
used to just weave
elaborate conspiracy theories

500
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,584
about my love life?

501
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,955
Those were such good times.

502
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,820
How much morphine
is the husband on?

503
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,356
We can't increase it any more.
His respirations
are depressed.

504
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:39,369
Increase it?
Drugs cloud people's judgment.

505
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,597
Cold-turkey the sucker.

506
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,766
No.

507
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,775
Good point.

508
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,755
Did I ask you guys
to follow me?

509
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,156
No, which made us nervous.

510
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,787
He'll catch on if he notices
he's off the morphine drip.

511
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,855
Shoot him up with one of
these puppies instead.

512
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,059
No!

513
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,567
You do understand
it's not really a puppy.

514
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,932
It's naloxone.

515
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,029
An opiate blocker?
He'll feel like
he's swallowing a bonfire.

516
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,869
That's pretty unethical,
even for you.

517
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,933
How is that unethical?
Lt'll lead to a diagnosis.

518
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,375
It's leading to
the torture of the husband

519
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,743
on the off-chance
he'll allow a procedure
on another person.

520
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,907
Which will lead
to a diagnosis.
Didn't I just say that?

521
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:25,972
Give it up.

522
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,884
Foreman and Cameron
are too ethical, and I'm
too scared of getting sued.

523
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,390
Fine. Now, I'm just going to
find someplace safe
to hide this

524
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,981
so I won't be tempted
to use it.

525
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,152
You're not doing it, either.

526
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,795
What, are you going
to run for it?

527
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:44,961
If they die now, they'll never
be able to grow old and tired
of each other.

528
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,374
We can't baby-sit
House all day.

529
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,972
Tell Cuddy to put a nurse
by his room.

530
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,414
Damn it!

531
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,952
Atropine? What happened to...

532
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,624
He knew we'd stop him.
He stuck both of them
in his pocket.

533
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,457
That's actually pretty clever.

534
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,728
Guess I can't use
that trick again, huh?

535
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,133
My stomach!

536
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,941
It was a pretty smart plan,
Jerry, but I'm onto you.

537
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,572
There's only one good reason
to kill the biopsy.

538
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,742
You poisoned your wife,
and you don't want
the coppers to get wise.

539
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,082
No!
Oh, all right.
Then you're just a moron.

540
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,712
Biopsy me!

541
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,781
Only if this thing hits
your brain, you moron.

542
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,191
And I can't stress
that "moron" part enough.

543
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,421
You're killing your wife.

544
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,726
She is the love of my life.

545
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,328
Careful. When she's dead
and you're on wife number two,

546
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,030
you're gonna feel real guilty
about saying that.

547
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,937
Feel that? Get used to it.

548
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,235
Pain's going to get
a lot worse.

549
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,570
No, it won't.

550
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,635
Morphine just isn't working
right now for some reason.

551
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:05,080
I'm putting you on a
tranquilizer in the meantime.
It'll work again soon.

552
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,139
Want to bet?

553
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,549
I don't care about the pain.

554
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,781
I need to be in pain,
because I have to get worse.

555
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,880
It means you can do
the biopsy on me.

556
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,222
Dude, she's in a coma.
Who are you trying to impress?

557
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,253
I'd die for her.

558
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:24,495
Give up. Or are we going to
wait for him to get all
grown up and cynical?

559
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,431
I was just going to call you.

560
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,238
I need a court order
to biopsy this woman's brain.

561
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,211
Speaking of litigation...

562
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,416
Michael Tritter,
you know Dr. House.

563
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,287
You guys can talk here.

564
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,824
I don't want to sue you.

565
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,952
Good.

566
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,361
I want to beat
the crap out of you.

567
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,865
Less good.
And I'll tell you why.

568
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,793
You're a bully,

569
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,598
and bullies,
they don't back down

570
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,803
until they run into someone
stronger and meaner.

571
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,271
But you'll accept an apology?

572
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,712
Yes.

573
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,148
Not really a recipe
for sincerity.

574
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,118
I'm not looking
for sincerity.

575
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,086
I'm looking for humiliation,

576
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:21,785
something that will make you
think twice before you treat
the next patient like crap.

577
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,755
Here's what's going to happen.

578
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,091
You go brag to your friends

579
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,928
about how you made
the big, nasty doctor
poop in his pants.

580
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,492
I get Cuddy off my back
by telling her that
I humiliated myself.

581
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,664
Here's the catch.
We're both going to be lying.

582
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,006
I'm not apologizing.

583
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,838
If anything,
you deserved a
bigger thermometer.

584
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,918
What's wrong?
Jeremy's worse.

585
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,652
And that's what's right.

586
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,593
Cut the stubborn jerk's
head open and take a slice.

587
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:58,856
It's not his brain.

588
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,558
Lactic acid's up to 39.
His intestines are rotting.

589
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,328
This isn't sarcoidosis.

590
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,426
Then he'll get his wish.

591
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:10,534
He's dying, just not in a way
that's going to help his wife.

592
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,241
Coma's worse.
She's losing response
to stimuli.

593
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,578
He's vomiting blood
and his lactic acid's 45.

594
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,709
He's got to have
ischemic bowel.
So what?

595
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,118
Well, let's see.
Lack of blood flow's
causing his guts to die,

596
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,281
which will cause him to die,

597
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,984
unless we cut out a few feet
of small intestine and
reattach the ends.

598
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,492
I don't know,
seems worth a mention.

599
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,392
Why does he have it?
What does it tell us?

600
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,622
Small-cell vasculitis?

601
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,255
Good. Now let's hear it again,

602
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,823
but this time with
a more environmental
or infectious feeling.

603
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,496
Or, like I said before,
it might not be
environmental or infectious.

604
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,472
He has vasculitis,
she has porphyria.

605
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,168
Belly pain plus hallucination,
classic symptoms.

606
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,370
It could even cause a coma.

607
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,073
Fine. Start her on
hematin for porphyria.

608
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,480
What about him?

609
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,882
Take out the dead bowel.
It's all we can do.

610
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,353
And biopsy it.
If Foreman's right,
it might save him.

611
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,550
If Foreman's wrong,
the dead bowel
might save both of them.

612
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,888
Bowel's not dead.

613
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:11,402
Unless he's been tossing down
frosty cans of lactic acid,
bowel is dead.

614
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,198
What we're looking for
is a reason it's dead.

615
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,636
Bowel's not dead.

616
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:19,040
Just general swelling
and edema. High lactate
was probably from stress.

617
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,477
We just sliced him open
from chest to pubic bone
for nothing.

618
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,379
Nothing's something.

619
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,313
Forget the ischemia.
Add the edema and swelling.

620
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,821
Probably from
cutting him open.

621
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,120
Probably, not definitely.

622
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,420
Okay, back to the beginning.

623
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,223
What did we talk about?
Anything. I want to
hear it all again.

624
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,389
Allergies.
Doesn't fit at all now.

625
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,933
CHASE: STDs. Maybe we
got the wrong one.

626
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:43,990
What about syphilis?

627
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,933
Neurological symptoms.
He wasn't cheating on her.

628
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,201
Yeah, love of his life.
Don't you have to
wait till he's dead

629
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,605
before you make
that determination?

630
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,438
She's his only
girlfriend ever.

631
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,809
They grew up next door,
ran off together as teenagers.

632
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,981
Sarcoidosis. We only ruled it
out because we thought
he had ischemic...

633
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,813
Why did they run off?
What difference does...

634
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,785
Kids talk about running off.
How many do it?

635
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:03,878
What was the reason?

636
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,890
They were trying to escape
his evil, pill-popping,
racist dad.

637
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,188
You would've liked him.
We should do another...

638
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,921
How do you know
the dad was racist?

639
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:14,260
He beat up his son for
dating a black girl.
I extrapolated from that.

640
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,357
You see racism everywhere.

641
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,296
Maybe he just didn't
like this black girl.

642
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,395
It's not sarcoid.
We would have seen
granulomas in his...

643
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,235
She has pretty eyes.

644
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:31,004
Forget infectious.
Forget environmental.

645
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:35,178
Defective DNA is
keeping them from making
a critical protein,

646
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,187
hence the fluid build-up.

647
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,723
Hits the throat, stomach,
chest and brain.

648
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,349
Angioedema?

649
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,328
Hereditary angioedema.
Symptoms fit perfectly.

650
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:49,230
It's an incredibly
rare disease. They both would
have to have a parent...

651
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,633
Is it a coincidence
that your sister
has great hair,

652
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,695
or that these two
have green eyes?

653
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:01,239
You're not saying...
They're not
brother and sister.

654
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,475
God, no. That would be sick.

655
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,585
Half brother and sister.
Different moms.

656
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,355
Dad must have had
an affair with her mom.

657
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,658
That's why he flipped out
when the kids started dating.

658
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,523
He had it himself.
Probably why the pills.

659
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,822
We won't know for sure...

660
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,456
Testing for HAE or paternity
is going to take a day.

661
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:25,366
She doesn't have a day.
Start treating and
see what happens.

662
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,335
Any change?

663
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,006
Her response to stimuli
is still just as weak.

664
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,375
I almost hope
she stays in a coma.

665
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,042
That's sweet, Cameron.

666
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,110
I'd like to avoid shattering
both of their lives.

667
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,348
You don't think
dying will do that?

668
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,886
(BEEPING)

669
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,924
It's just her oximeter.

670
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,300
Tracy.

671
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,736
Tracy.

672
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,143
She's awake.

673
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,809
Oh, God, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

674
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,251
Awesome. Can I tell them?

675
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,659
We've obviously got to
let them know what's wrong.

676
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,996
But the cause,
the brother-sister thing...

677
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,437
Good plan. We just gotta
keep them away from doctors,
the Internet

678
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,030
and anyone who's
not a total moron.

679
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,332
Tell them.

680
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:43,244
Yesterday he was willing to
die to save her. We've gotta
give him time to recover.

681
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:48,115
He might be a little vexed
that you kept letting him hump
his sister in the meantime.

682
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,710
Tell them.

683
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:53,052
Look, unless their dad
was also the product
of an incestuous union,

684
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,922
the chances of serious
complications are minimal.

685
00:34:55,993 --> 00:35:00,726
Noble of you to
take that risk.
Tell them, or I will.

686
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,998
So we just need
to take these pills?

687
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,594
Twice a day.

688
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,664
Angioedema is very treatable.
You'll be fine.

689
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,341
So, what? We, like,
caught this from each other?

690
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,609
No, it's a condition
you've both always had.

691
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,882
The onset of symptoms
are sometimes caused
by stress or trauma.

692
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,977
The incident at the diner.

693
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,284
So we got it as kids?

694
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:29,986
It's a genetic disease.
It's not...

695
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:36,162
There's no good reason
two unrelated people
would get it.

696
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,302
We think you guys
should take a DNA test.

697
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,140
How can we be related?

698
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,512
We think you have
the same dad.

699
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,715
We won't know for sure
until we do the test.

700
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,345
Oh, God!

701
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,357
Your father.

702
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,194
No. No, this can't be true.

703
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,759
Yeah. Yeah, Jer, I'm lighter.

704
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,896
You know, I'm lighter
than both my parents.

705
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:19,432
And our eyes.
Everyone always talks about
how we have the same eyes.

706
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,740
You're not really siblings.

707
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,176
We have the same father!

708
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,188
You didn't fight in
the backseat on car trips.

709
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,314
You didn't change
each other's diapers.

710
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,157
You guys just met
and fell in love.

711
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:43,896
The way you feel,
that hasn't changed.

712
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,392
Hey, Foreman, can you wear
the beeper for a couple
of hours this weekend?

713
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,695
What?

714
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,497
We just destroyed
two people's lives.

715
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,367
So I'm not allowed to
run errands anymore?

716
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,168
I'd like to see some sign
that it affects you,

717
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,505
or that you recognize
it affects other people.

718
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,237
So are you going to wear
the beeper or not?

719
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,835
Sorry, I can't.

720
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,307
You just want to punish me.

721
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,818
I'm busy.

722
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,182
With what?

723
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,683
Going out of town.

724
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,855
Where are you going?

725
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,857
Foreman, you're not missing
a blue shoe, are you?

726
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,300
Come...

727
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,043
You can't bet
when you know
the answer beforehand.

728
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,511
We could spend all day
arguing whether you can bet

729
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,138
when you know
the answer beforehand.

730
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,479
Give me the 200 bucks.

731
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,457
What?

732
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,069
Hey.
Hey.

733
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,781
You okay?

734
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,912
I was just wondering,
do you really like jazz?

735
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,686
I love it.

736
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,416
Are you lying?

737
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,294
I'm lying.

738
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,497
I want to spend time with you.

739
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,566
Is that so terrible?

740
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,662
No.

741
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,776
Maybe we shouldn't
walk out together.
If people see us leaving...

742
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,442
Everybody's got to
find out sometime.

743
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,249
Let me just meet you
at your place.

744
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,002
She got her own room.

745
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,472
She just needs
some time alone.

746
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,780
Do you want me to
hang out here a bit?

747
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,742
If you've come to return
the thermometer, don't bother.
I've moved on.

748
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,879
If you'd actually read
my chart, you'd have
known that I'm a cop.

749
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,656
You were going 40
in a 25 zone.

750
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,422
Oh, come on.

751
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,188
This isn't because
I was speeding, this is
because I'm Latino.

752
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,496
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

753
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:48,095
Sorry, cool jacket.
Only pockets
for important stuff.

754
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,696
That's a shame.

755
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,142
A 50 buck ticket?

756
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,235
Is that your way of
beating me up,

757
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,507
or is that just the price
for sticking something in you?

758
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,379
You took a pill
while you were examining
a patient.

759
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,716
That's serious
addictive behavior.

760
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,992
I'm betting that
you're holding right now.

761
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,992
I wasn't weaving.
I'm not drunk.

762
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,964
You've got no reason to...
Pupils dilated.

763
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,763
Appear to be under
the influence of a narcotic.

764
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:23,034
Would you mind turning around,
please, and putting your hands
behind your head?

765
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,940
Does that polite crap
ever work on people?

766
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:33,478
Most people realize
there's only one answer.

767
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,652
You got a prescription?

768
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,092
I'm a cripple who
works in a hospital.

769
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,153
You don't think
I can get a
valid prescription?

770
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,823
Arrogant son of a bitch
like you?

771
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,595
I'm going to bet
you didn't bother.

772
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:57,733
You are under arrest
for possession of narcotics.

773
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,739
You have the right
to remain silent,

774
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:04,406
which you should
take advantage of
for once in your life.

775
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,108
If you give up the right
to remain silent,

776
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:09,380
anything you say
can and will be used
against you...
