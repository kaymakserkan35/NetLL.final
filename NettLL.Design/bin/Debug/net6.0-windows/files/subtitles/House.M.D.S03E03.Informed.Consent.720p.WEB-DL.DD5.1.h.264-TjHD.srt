1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,378
You're not going to
make this easy, are you?

2
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,809
Unfortunately, as much as I
admire your spirit...

3
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,349
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

4
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:38,164
Subject anesthetized
with.5 CC's
of sodium pentobarbital.

5
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,474
Transfected with
human hepatic cancer cells.

6
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:47,537
Underwent six rounds
of intra-abdominal treatment
with ES-22.

7
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,820
Vertical incision
through the rectus sheath
opens the abdominal cavity.

8
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,047
Incision extended into...

9
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,823
the thorax.

10
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,753
(COUGHS)

11
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:09,025
Liver appears normal in color.
No apparent scarring or...

12
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,265
Damn it!

13
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,101
Cancerous tumors still present
on the right lobe,

14
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:23,608
1.12 centimeters in diameter.
No reduction.

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,351
(GASPING)

16
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,858
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,225
71-year-old
cancer research specialist.

18
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:45,560
Minor tremors,
a localized melanoma removed
two years ago, cataracts.

19
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,690
And he can't breathe.

20
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:51,294
Also, disregard the facial
lacerations. They're creepy,
but unfortunately irrelevant.

21
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,203
Don't you wanna know why?

22
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,639
You have your cane.

23
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,970
No, why the lacerations
are creepy.

24
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,910
He was about to dissect
one of his lab rats
when he collapsed.

25
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,576
The little vermin
seized the day, so to speak,
and went medieval on his ass.

26
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,450
What? My fly open?

27
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,455
So, the pain's returned?

28
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,388
There was no pain.
He was unconscious.

29
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,255
I'm guessing because
he wasn't able to breathe.

30
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,589
We're talking about you.

31
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,925
Obviously. I'm obviously not.

32
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,291
What is it with you people?

33
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,333
I don't use the cane,
you're shocked.
I use the cane...

34
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,493
We're just concerned.

35
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,662
About the wrong person.
I can breathe.

36
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,796
Ezra Powell,
on the other hand,
is gonna die.

37
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,636
The Ezra Powell?
The researcher?

38
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,902
The guy who wrote
that textbook?

39
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,568
"That" textbook?
The textbook.

40
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,044
Wait. There's actually
another doctor you admire?

41
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,911
I admire lots of doctors.

42
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,713
Of course, most of them
look a lot better in
knee socks than Ezra Powell,

43
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,352
but seeing as they
can all breathe...

44
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,254
CHASE: Oxygenation is
through the floor
and lungs are full of fluid.

45
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,791
Gotta be his heart.

46
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,881
Could be amyloidosis.

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,452
Or his lungs, probably from
years of inhaling
toxic chemicals in his lab.

48
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,657
CHASE: It's not the lungs.
The chest x-ray's clean.

49
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,290
FOREMAN: So's his EKG.
It's not his heart.

50
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,891
We're being too nice.

51
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,701
Outside the hospital
he can't breathe.

52
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,171
Inside the hospital he can,
because we help,

53
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,471
at least enough
to screw with
our test results.

54
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,205
The source of
the problem's either
in his heart or his lungs,

55
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,876
so all we gotta do is
stop helping,

56
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,314
put a little pressure on him
and see which gives out first.

57
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:15,548
At 71, we get his heart
or lungs to give out, we might
not get them to give in again.

58
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,590
That's why we're gonna do it
in a hospital.

59
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,956
Put him on an
inclined treadmill
and do a stress EKG.

60
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,419
So much for the admiration.

61
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,659
Let's get you started.
I'll turn your oxygen up.

62
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,294
I...

63
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,739
I worked with Williams
on the first protocol
for this machine.

64
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,641
Everyone still uses it.

65
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,409
Except for Williams.
He died four years ago.

66
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,882
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,116
He was 84.
He died parasailing.

68
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,020
He was always an idiot.

69
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,389
You okay?

70
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,524
Hang in there.
You know the protocol's
only a few minutes.

71
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,157
FOREMAN:
His heart rate's flat.

72
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,430
If we don't get it past 130,
we're not going to
see anything.

73
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,972
And if he falls
and breaks a hip, we're not
going to see anything either.

74
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,134
Except an increase
in our malpractice insurance.

75
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,536
I figured House might
go back to the pills,

76
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,811
but if he's using his cane,
he's right back
to where he was before.

77
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,976
Maybe even worse.

78
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,146
Luckily, he'll handle it
in a stoic, grown-up fashion.

79
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,416
He'd never take it out on us.

80
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,356
I can't.

81
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,688
I've got to stop.

82
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,997
Just a little longer.

83
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,270
His heart rate's only 90.
I'm going to increase
the incline.

84
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,203
I've got to stop.
I've got to get off.

85
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,246
You're doing great.
Just a little faster, okay?

86
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,877
I don't need a cheerleader,
I need oxygen.

87
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,179
Stop. This isn't working.

88
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,730
His heart rate
barely got above 90.

89
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,288
He can't breathe.
There's too much fluid
in his lungs.

90
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,858
Really?
He's got fluid in his lungs?

91
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,700
Whatever are we gonna do?
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

92
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,400
Put him on a treadmill
and run him like
one of his rats on a wheel.

93
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,874
He can't run.
He can hardly walk.

94
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,308
That's 'cause he's not
trying hard enough.

95
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,811
If he was, his heart rate
would go up.

96
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,677
Exercising with a lung full of
your own bodily fluids
tends to hurt.

97
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,445
They don't call it
a stress test for nothing.
Do it again.

98
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,507
He's drowning.

99
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,249
Then pull him out of the pool
and do it again.

100
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,527
I'm assuming this isn't
your idea of
a long-term solution.

101
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,223
We need to get rid
of the fluid in your lungs,

102
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,698
so you'll be able to
do the test.

103
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,032
To see if it's my heart
or my lungs?

104
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,263
Exactly.

105
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,600
My money's on both.

106
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,868
I've been in and out
of the hospital
for the past year.

107
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:55,107
I'm old. I'm sick.
And I'm getting older
and sicker.

108
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,715
Not a very interesting
differential but...

109
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,547
I'm in.

110
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,526
You don't need a $400 handbag.

111
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,591
It's kinda hard to check
your throat when you're
flapping your gums around.

112
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,794
Sorry.

113
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,428
But it's for the fall formal.

114
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,902
He doesn't care if it's
for the Presidential
Inauguration.

115
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,910
But I'm using Marissa'a
old dress. It's free.

116
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,570
You know what else is free?

117
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,014
The roof over your head,
the food you eat,
your phone, your computer.

118
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,209
How long have you
been congested?

119
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,685
All week, ever since we
got back from Fresno.

120
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,019
Fresno? That's in France,
right? See the Parthenon?

121
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,089
California.

122
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,257
I've got no appetite,
I'm aching all over, I'm weak.

123
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,557
Does that hurt?
Oh, yeah.

124
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:50,159
Does his voice always have
that unattractive nasal tone?

125
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,764
Totally.

126
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,831
I'm gonna take that giggle
as a "no".

127
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,502
Fever, aches, weakness,
loss of appetite.

128
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,308
You been having an anal sex
with IV drug users lately?

129
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,473
Of course not. I'm married.

130
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,147
You think she might have
been having...

131
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,742
No!

132
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,617
Probably a rhinovirus.

133
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,814
What's that?

134
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,583
A cold.

135
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,785
Take this four times a day,
and stay off airplanes.

136
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,887
They're flying cesspools.

137
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,757
Oops!

138
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,801
You dropped something.

139
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,196
If there's anything else
you can think of, please call.

140
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,434
Yes?

141
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,139
He's too old and weak.

142
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,282
Yeah, this is way better.
This'll work.

143
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,424
Just try.

144
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,187
There are 20 words
to describe chest pain.

145
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:57,293
Burning, squeezing,
stabbing, tearing...

146
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,702
Each one
diagnostically useful.

147
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,240
For that,
you have to thank
Dr. Powell's textbook.

148
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,211
But there are no words
to describe degrees of what
he's feeling right now.

149
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,043
Shortness of breath.

150
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,012
If he had worked
on those issues,
there would be.

151
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,754
He never would have given up
until he had an answer.

152
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,550
This isn't working.

153
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,451
Dr. House...

154
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,654
Please don't get up.

155
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,424
I'm sure you're very busy,

156
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,467
I'm just gonna try
and speed things up a little.

157
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,331
Is that epi?
That's not the protocol.

158
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:35,466
No. The protocol is
what you tried to do
and failed each time.

159
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,806
Over 100. Now we're
getting somewhere.

160
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,041
How does it look, Foreman?

161
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,639
No EKG changes.

162
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,943
Then we push harder.

163
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,350
House, you're gonna kill him.

164
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,015
No, he's right. Let him do it.

165
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,789
See? That's why he doesn't
have to wear knee socks.

166
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,486
He can't breathe.

167
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,390
130, our magic number.

168
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,395
Nothing here. Foreman?

169
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,768
Still no sign of blockage.

170
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,008
Which means
it's not the heart.
It must be the lungs.

171
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,512
See, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

172
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,208
No. Just give me the rest
of the epinephrine.

173
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,516
The test is over. It's okay.
We're going to stabilize you.

174
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,748
No.

175
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,451
No, just let me die.

176
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,515
You're not gonna die.

177
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,391
Yes, I am.

178
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,363
We'll find a treatment.

179
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,733
I don't want to
live like this.

180
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,427
Please, I'm begging you.

181
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,902
Kill me.

182
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,971
He says no more tests.

183
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,279
He wants to die
and he wants us
to help him do it.

184
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,718
And I wanna play
a little game I like to call
Block My Spike with Misty May.

185
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,018
He's thought this through.
It's not
an impulsive decision.

186
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,149
Neither is mine.
He's depressed.

187
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,659
He'll feel much better
after we cure him.

188
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,354
He's seen all the tests
we've seen.

189
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,592
Even if we figure out what's
causing the lung damage,
it's too late to reverse it.

190
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,566
You can't know that
without knowing what's wrong.

191
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,999
It's his call.

192
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,093
So what do we do?

193
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,161
Do we just put a plastic bag
over his head
and get it over with?

194
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,140
No, we give him
a syringe full of morphine.

195
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,804
Every doctor
I've ever practiced with
has done it.

196
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,541
They don't want to,
they don't like to,

197
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,981
but that's the way it is.
I haven't. I won't.

198
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,109
I couldn't do it either.

199
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,244
You just said we should
respect his decision.

200
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,720
Respect it doesn't necessarily
mean we honor it.

201
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,384
Right. It just means
we talk about it.

202
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,220
At some point, "do no harm"
has to mean allowing nature
to take its course,

203
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,854
not stubbornly
standing in the way of it.

204
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,298
Sticking a metal syringe
into a plastic IV line
and pumping in

205
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,531
a lethal dose of morphine
is not letting nature
take its course,

206
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,037
not according to
the State of New Jersey.

207
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,836
So it's better we allow him
to slowly suffocate
in his own plasma?

208
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,036
Whose side are you on,
Senator?

209
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,205
First respect his wishes,
then invade Iraq,
then get the troops home.

210
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,249
Make up your mind.
Wow.

211
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,113
There's certainly
a lot of interesting things
to consider.

212
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,620
The stress EKG
rules out the heart,

213
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,417
which means something's
gotta be attacking his lungs.

214
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,982
Could be mycoplasma
or Strep pneumo,
which probably means

215
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,426
it's too late
to do anything about it.

216
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,327
We could try levofloxacin.

217
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,457
Coming up with a new treatment
isn't gonna do us any good

218
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,797
unless we convince him
it's worth trying.

219
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,828
Come on. He's old
and sick and tiny.

220
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,031
And we can do
whatever we want to him.

221
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,709
(PAGERS BEEPING)

222
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,477
What happened?

223
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,850
I don't know.

224
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,183
He must have fallen out of bed

225
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,350
and got the nasal canula
wrapped around his neck
somehow.

226
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,394
Ezra, what are you doing?

227
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:47,091
I don't want to live
hooked to machines,
too weak to wipe my own ass.

228
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,565
Why would you want to
wipe your own ass

229
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,226
when you could have someone
do it for you?

230
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,769
You're wasting your time.

231
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,067
There must be other patients
you could actually help.

232
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,133
All services rendered
on a first come,
first served basis.

233
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,939
I won't consent
to any more tests.

234
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,906
And if anyone tries to
so much as touch me,

235
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,049
I'll press charges
for assault.

236
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,486
You heard the man.

237
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,357
He wants everyone to
leave him alone.
Why don't you go first?

238
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,857
Get out!

239
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,700
You came to me.
I didn't come to you.

240
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:34,705
I figured you'd have the guts
to do what had to be done
if it came to that.

241
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:39,050
We're nowhere near that.
It's time to test your lungs.

242
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,951
Breathe!

243
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,616
You're gonna have to
exhale sometime.

244
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,681
Stop!

245
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,091
House, you're hurting him.

246
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,253
You're hurting me.

247
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,160
(COUGHING)

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,561
Fine. If you don't help us,
we don't help you.

249
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,371
Your lungs slowly
fill with fluid.

250
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,570
You gasp to
catch every breath,
but never can.

251
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,670
Every breath is petrifying.

252
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,712
It'll be slow, painful,
torturous.

253
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,719
We don't choose our birth.
And we don't choose our death.

254
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,689
What if you could?
How about we make a deal?

255
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,496
Give me one more day.

256
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,064
If I don't find out exactly
what's wrong with you by then,

257
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,233
I'll help you die.
House.

258
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,571
Twenty-four hours.

259
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,280
Come on,
it's not gonna kill you.

260
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,718
Old guy, lungs, fluid. Go.

261
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:54,952
You cannot help him
kill himself.

262
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,051
Of course I can.

263
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,459
Chase says we do it
all the time.

264
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,928
Cuddy is not gonna let you.

265
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,260
Enough!

266
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,959
You don't want me to kill him.
Fine.

267
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,831
Here's a big shock.
I don't want to
kill him either.

268
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,100
How do I not kill him?
By you guys doing your job.

269
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,740
We have 24 hours to figure out
what's wrong with him.

270
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,068
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

271
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,908
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia.
Should be bacteria
in his blood.

272
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,470
That's gonna take
longer than 24 hours.

273
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,776
Not if I spin down the sample.

274
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,717
Separate off the buffy coat,
then Gram stain for bacteria.

275
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:25,255
Great. Do an amylase, D-dimer,
C-reactive peptide,
get a urine,

276
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,224
and do a bronchial sputum
while you're at it.

277
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,887
And you, check his home
and lab for radiation
and toxins.

278
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,259
And do a bone marrow biopsy.

279
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,423
All of that in 24 hours?
Nah.

280
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:37,196
Whatever you don't get done,
you can finish at the autopsy.

281
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,978
Wow. You guys look like crap.

282
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,406
What have you got?

283
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,676
Purple dye on my fingers.

284
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,081
What did the bone marrow
biopsy show?

285
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,175
I don't have the results.

286
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,243
What? What have you
been doing all night?

287
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,152
Jell-O shots and wild sex,
what else?

288
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,282
FOREMAN: There's no bacteria
in the blood cultures.

289
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,519
We still have some cooking,
but so far, nothing.

290
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,618
Nothing in the urine.

291
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,096
Lab was clean enough
to do surgery in,
because, well, they do.

292
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,529
And there was
no sign of viruses

293
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,227
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Or fleas on any of the rats.

294
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,460
Yeah.

295
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,096
Who?

296
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,871
Tell her to call the clinic.

297
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,172
Then tell her to
leave a message
and I'll get back to her.

298
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,941
Then tell her to leave
a personal message.

299
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,038
Who's that?

300
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,412
That's your protégé.

301
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,677
What are these?

302
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,219
Dictation tapes.
He records everything.
Why?

303
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,982
Because he's
a diligent researcher?

304
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,546
Or he's losing his memory.

305
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,955
A lot of people
dictate their notes.

306
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,119
Yes, we could assume that
and we'd have nothing.

307
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,388
Or we could assume
it's a symptom,

308
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,728
in which case
whatever's in his lungs
is also in his brain,

309
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,631
unless you've got
something more promising.

310
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,191
I'll go get an MRI
of his head.

311
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,238
Keep testing
till you find something.

312
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,138
I'm going to my office
to rest for a while.

313
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,739
It's been a long time
since I took an anatomy class,

314
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,910
but I'm pretty sure you're
moving farther and farther
away from my lungs.

315
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,475
Running out of places to look,
aren't you?

316
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,646
It doesn't mean
we're gonna stop looking.

317
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,986
Oh, no.
Not for six more hours.

318
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,219
Do you want us to fail?
No.

319
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,528
But you will.

320
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,875
No abnormal nuclei means
no leukemia. He a drinker?

321
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,308
Not according to the history.

322
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,401
Which means yes, he drinks,

323
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,346
which gives us a nice
mundane explanation
for the acellularity.

324
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,475
Or he's telling the truth,
which means fungus
is still on the table.

325
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,520
But your entire view
of human nature
gets destroyed.

326
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,216
Six of one,
half a dozen of the other.

327
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,350
Bad news fast. Good news,
you can take your time.

328
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,963
Head's clean. You were wrong.
His faculties are intact.

329
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,089
Too bad.
If his brain was addled,

330
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,724
we wouldn't have
to listen to anything he says.

331
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,426
Hand me the 10 percent KOH.

332
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,198
It's 4:00.
We have nothing to tell him.

333
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,206
Then we have no reason
to talk to him. We still
haven't ruled out fungus.

334
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,902
Yeah, we have.
No bugs, no hyphae.

335
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,680
Okay. Next procedure.

336
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,240
We sneak in,

Nope.

339
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,927
Your bone marrow biopsy
revealed multiple myeloma.

340
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,131
It's not good news,
but there are some treatments.

341
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,363
I need to draw some blood.

342
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,699
What about my breathing?

343
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:38,141
Associated hyper-viscosity
syndrome gummed up the
blood vessels in your lungs.

344
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,044
Dr. Chase said
my calcium is normal.

345

We call him Dr. Idiot.

346

There's no
M protein in my urine.

00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,312
Odd presentation.

doesn't believe it either.

We had a deal. No more tests.

351
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,732
Fair enough.
Give me six more hours.

352
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,633
Listen, there is no evidence
that you are terminal.

You a man of your word or not?

354
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,405
No, as a matter of fact,
I'm not.

355
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,106
Fine. Then discharge me.

356
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,477
My lungs will slowly
fill with fluid.

357
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:25,446
I'll gasp to
catch every breath,
but never can.

358
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:30,689
Every breath will be
petrifying. It'll be slow,
painful, torturous.

You really gonna
let me die like that?

00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,537
Where are you going?
Nowhere.

361
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,319
Everybody who can walk
should get out of here.

362
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,729
You can't do that.

363
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,096

pain killer to a patient
who's in pain?

365
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,828
Go.

366
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,430
Make sure somebody sees you
downstairs in the cafeteria.

367
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,476
I can't let you do this.

368

or I just die.

That... That's what
the argument is here.
No.

00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,209
It's about whether you die
or we murder you.

is that someone's getting
a buttload of morphine.

I'm not sure exactly who
at this point.

00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,809

on the other side.

a reasonable person
would consent to.

389
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,726

obviously consent to being put

do these cuts so far down
on this MRI of his head?

and his C-spine

00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,233
to make sure
his diaphragm
wasn't paralyzed.

400
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,759
You also caught
the top of his lungs.
There's scarring.

You do know that you
can't really pierce me
with your stares.

402

Lung scarring along with
the bad bone marrow points
to an autoimmune disease.

403
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,806
Could be pulmonary fibrosis.
Or lupus.

He can kill himself
after we get him better.

405

Start him on an IVIG
for the lupus
and get a colonoscopy.

hiding there.

All she's doing is
running away
from the principle,

so she won't have to feel
uncomfortable facing it.

your little stunt
with Dr. Powell.

426

Not really a stunt.
More of a trick.

431
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,234
I just thought
the same principle
might apply.

432
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,530
It does.

433
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,828

just to see
if they had urethral reflux.

485
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,857
He was curious.

486
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,400
He didn't even
tell their parents
he was doing an experiment.

487
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,402
He wasn't doing anything
his peers weren't doing.

and Willowbrook?

489
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,333
He ignored the rights of a few
to save many.

490
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,239
So you're okay
with what he did?

491

It doesn't matter
what I think.

It's what you think
that's relevant.

less of him,

The fact that a patient
did bad things
doesn't change anything.

496

He still deserves to
have some control
over his own body.

00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,679
Maybe he'll die right now,
make everything easy
for all of us.

504
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,953
Heart rate's fast. BP's low.

505
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,266
No breath sounds on
the right side.
He's dropped his right lung.

506
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,770
Air's building up
in his chest,
compressing his heart.

507
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,144
Heart rate's decreasing.

508
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,947
BP's stabilizing.

509
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,969
What are you doing?

510
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:26,542
He withdraws from pain stimuli
on the left side
but not the right.

511
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,245
Those are just reflex arcs.

512
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,513
He's under anesthesia.

513
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,147
Or he's lost sensation
in some places.

514
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,192
Or the hypoxia from the arrest
stunned his CNS.

515
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,728
Only one way to tell.
Do somatosensory
evoked potentials.

516
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,423
We can't do that
while he's in a coma.

517
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,893
Only two ways to tell.
Get a hammer and check
his deep tendon reflexes.

518
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:47,267
It won't work.
He needs muscle relaxants
to be on the ventilator.

519
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,033
Only one more way to tell.
Pupillary reflexes.

520
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,474
All that tests is
the brain stem.
See, I was right.

521
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,273
Only one way to tell.
Do somatosensory
evoked potentials.

522
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,405
I just said,
we can't do that
while he's in a coma.

523
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,006
So wake him up.

524
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,128
Don't go towards the light.

525
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,933
You'll fall
and break your hip.

526
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,171
(COUGHING)

527
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,159
What's happening? I...

528
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,098
You took a little nap.

529
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,901
I thought I told you
I didn't want...

530
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,135
Sorry. A little deaf
in one ear.

531
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,634
Your bone marrow
is hypocellular.

532
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,909
We've ruled out lupus
and pulmonary fibrosis.

533
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,176
But it looks like it could be
attacking your nerves.

534
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:11,153
So this is all a waste?
A huge failure?

535
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,419
Lmpossible.
You're Gregory House.

536
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,961
We need to attach some sensors
to your skin.

537
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,019
No.

538
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,793
Look, we can't
do what you want.

539
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,697
We've assigned a nurse
to watch you,
so you can't do it either.

540
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,463
So you might as well
just let us do the test.

541
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,368
No. I want to be discharged.

542
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,169
You can't be discharged.
You've got two chest tubes in.

543
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,573
Then take them out!

544
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,372
Oh, get over yourself.

545
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,346
The ventilator puffed up
your lungs. You'll be fine
for a few hours.

546
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,440
Just let us run the tests.

547
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,212
Okay.

548
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,485
But first,
let's clean you up a little.

549
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,295
What...
Does that feel nice?

550
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,422
What are you trying to prove?
Just cleaning him up.

551
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,399
What does it look like?

552
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,361
Pay no attention
to the man behind the curtain.

553
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,802
Get out!

554
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,107
Okay, I'm going already.
Can't you see I'm a cripple?

555
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,478
Okay, so you've
got me curious.

556
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,609
I was right.

557
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,176
Whatever is
attacking his lungs
is attacking his nerves.

558
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,984
And you got that by
splashing ice water on him?

559
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,753
No sensation in the left leg,
abdomen, right arm.

560
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,191
Technology's overrated.

561
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,024
That means the clean MRI
of his brain means

562
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,563
it's just affecting
the peripheral nerves.

563
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:27,722
And bone marrow.

564
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,426
Kawasaki's would explain
the kidney failure.

565
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,593
So would lymphoma.
So would sarcoidosis.

566
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,763
All potentially treatable.
The question is which?

567
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,774
We need to catch
the little bastards
in the act.

568
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,036
What's the largest organ?

569
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,340
Skin.
We need to get a piece.

570
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,115
Sure. We'll just wait until
he leaves his room
without his skin,

571
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,208
sneak in and take a piece.

572
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,178
I want you to get
a skin sample for a biopsy.

573
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,380
And I want to get
a foot massage
from Johnny Damon.

574
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:57,451
Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma,
and sarcoidosis
are all treatable.

575
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,998
And it could be a hundred
other things that aren't
treatable. You have no idea.

576
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,464
But you do.

577
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,598
You know everything.
I didn't say that I...

578
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,000
Exactly!

579
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,405
You can't decide
if we're helping
or hurting him.

580
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,934
If it's good or bad,
or if you want paper, plastic,
or a burlap sack.

581
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,373
Do your damn job.

582
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,708
I'm not gonna lie to him.

583
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:29,816
Fine. Tell the truth.
Just get me a pound of flesh.

584
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,994
What do you want?

585
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,267
House wants to
biopsy your skin.
He sent me to get it.

586
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,398
And you agreed?

587
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,205
I had nothing to do with
putting you in a coma or
any of the subsequent tests.

588
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,041
Which brings us to now.

589
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,740
I read some of your articles.

590
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,306
There were a lot of them.

591
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,120
1967 <i>Massachusetts</i>
<i>Medical Journal.</i>

592
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,288
You radiated babies,
just like that. No forms,
no questions, nothing.

593
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,921
Who knows how many cancers
you caused?

594
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,464
I don't know.

595
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,397
But what I do know is,
we discovered techniques that

596
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,996
prevent fatal kidney failures
in hundreds of thousands
of other kids.

597
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,532
You're not sorry.

598
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,575
I don't regret what I did.

599
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:23,512
Informed consent,
patient rights...
Holds back research.

600
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,381
(GROANS)

601
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,411
What the hell are you doing?

602
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,548
Informed consent
is holding back our diagnosis.

603
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,859
Good for you.

604
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:42,194
Finally standing up
for something.
Acting on what you believe.

605
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,941
Dr. House? Hi. How are you?

606
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,177
Not as good as you think I am.

607
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,576
Don't worry, I'm not
stalking you. My dad
just lost his medicine.

608
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,409
I needed to come back
for another prescription.

609
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,880
Yeah, right.

610
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,741
He's moving it
on the street, isn't he?

611
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,616
Yeah, my dad,
the meth kingpin.

612
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,688
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls?

613
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,062
I plan to
in a couple of years.

614
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,026
I was just calling to say
thank you and to tell you
how impressed I was.

615
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,831
You diagnosed my dad
by just looking at him.

616
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,804
I felt his glands, too.

617
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,669
Well, there's my dad.
I've got to go.

618
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,337
Yeah, me, too.

619
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:32,280
And, you really don't have to
wait a couple of years
to return my calls.

620
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,041
Just six months,
till I turn 18.

621
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,291
It's not Kawasaki's either.
What next?

622
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,595
Congo red.

623
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:51,959
Amyloidosis?

624
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,231
What the hell else
would I mean by Congo red?

625
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,294
It's not on the list.

626
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,738
There's no reason
for it to be on the list.

627
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:00,038
An abnormal protein
is building up
inside the cells of his body,

628
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,874
shutting down his organs
one by one.
It explains everything.

629
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,109
The infiltrates on the x-ray,
the bone marrow,
kidney failure.

630
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,640
We rejected amyloidosis
because it didn't fit
the first symptom we found.

631
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,050
It would affect his heart.
It did.

632
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,281
It wasn't on the stress test.

633
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,152
We didn't push him
hard enough.

634
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,624
Add the stain
and let's find out.

635
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,786
Congo red added.

636
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,522
Change the polarization
of the light already.

637
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,608
That means
it should be treatable.

638
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,433
How the hell did you
pull that out of...

639
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,742
Not out of mine.
I had a muse.

640
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,950
Oh, God. Protein type AA.

641
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,065
Dr. House...

642
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,573
You have amyloidosis.

643
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,941
It's in your lungs, kidneys,
bone marrow and brain.

644
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,110
Why should I believe you now?

645
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:21,488
If I was lying,
I wouldn't tell you
the sub-type is AA.

646
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,894
It's terminal.

647
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,994
Congratulations.

648
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,232
You got your answer.

649
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,700
<i>(INTO DUST</i> PLAYING)

650
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,258
Ezra Powell
passed away last night.

651
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,528
I'm sure you already
knew about that.

652
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,801
No, I just got in.

653
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:18,063
The nurse charted at 2:00 a.m.
He was stable,
breathing labored but regular.

654
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,669
Then, at 2:30, he suddenly
stopped. You know
anything about that?

655
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,680
If I did, would you
really want to know?

656
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,283
I'm proud of you.
