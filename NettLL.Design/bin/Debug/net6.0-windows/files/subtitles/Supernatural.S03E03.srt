1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,200
Look, Dad's gone now.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,900
We have to carry out his legacy,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,400
And that means hunting down as many
evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,500
Did I die?

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,200
Did you sell your soul for me?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
How long do you get?

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,200
One year.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,500
You shouldn't have done that.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,700
I guess I got to save
your ass for a change.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What kind of blade can kill a demon?

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,200
Yesterday, I would have
said there was no such thing.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Who was that masked chick?

13
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,600
You ever run across a
guy named Gordon Walker?

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,200
He is dangerous to everyone
and everything around him.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,200
This demon tells me they have soldiers..

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,000
To fight in this coming war.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,900
Humans fighting on hell's side.

18
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,900
I know about Sam's visions.

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,200
I know everything, and
your brother's fair game.

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,100
Aah!

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,900
Gordon should be reaching for the
soap for the next few years, at least.

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,500
Tell me who you are!

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,900
You're a demon.

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,700
I'm here..

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,900
Because I want to help you.

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,300
What could
you possibly --

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
I can help you save your brother.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
It's true.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,300
The devil's gate was opened in Wyoming.

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Big...

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,500
St. Helens big.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
There's no solid fix on
how many demons got out,

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,800
But it's in the
hundreds -An army.

34
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,800
Sam Winchester was there,

35
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,800
Wasn't he?

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,500
Talked to a guy who knows
guy who knows Bobby Singer,

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,100
And, yeah, looks like the
Winchesters were at ground zero

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,500
When the gate was popped.

39
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,400
But Singer said they
went in there to stop it.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Mnh-Mnh.

41
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
Bobby's edge ain't what it used to be.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Sam could have him
believing anything by now.

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Listen, Gordon.

44
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,200
As far as talk goes,

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
Sam Winchester checks out.

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,000
He's a hunter. That's all.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
That's all?

48
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,600
Kubrick...

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,100
I'm not even sure he's human.

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Think I'm crazy?

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
I told you there was a war coming..

52
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,500
Six months ago.

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,200
Take a look around.

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,900
It's here.

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,700
Now I'm telling you
this boy is a part of it.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,300
Track him down, Kubrick.

57
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,300
You'll come to see it, too.

58
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,200
Sam Winchester must die.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Because demon, that's why.

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,700
I mean, the second you find
out this ruby chick is a demon,

61
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,000
You go for the holy water.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,200
You don't chat.
No one was chatting, Dean.

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,100
Oh, yeah? Then why didn't
you send her ass back to hell?

64
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,900
Because -Because she said she
might be able to help us out.

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,700
How?

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
Oh, really, Sam? How? How
could she possibly help us?

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
She told me she could help you, okay?

68
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
Help you out of the crossroads deal.

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,700
What's wrong with you, huh? She's lying.

70
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
You got to know that, don't you?

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
She knows what your
weakness is. It's me.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,900
What else did she say?

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
Dude?
Nothing.

74
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,700
Nothing, okay?!

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Look, I'm not an idiot, Dean.

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm not talking about trusting her.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm talking about using her.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,300
I mean, we're at war, right?

79
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
And we don't know jack about the enemy.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We don't know where they are.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,300
We don't know what they're doing.

82
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
Hell, we don't even know what they want.

83
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,200
Now, this ruby girl

84
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,700
Knows more than we will
ever find out on our own.

85
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,400
Now, yes, it's a risk. I know that.

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
But we need to take it.

87
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,300
You're okay, right? I
mean, you're feeling okay?

88
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,100
Yes, I'm fine! Why are
you always asking me that?

89
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
It's not mine.

90
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,800
Nope.

91
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,500
Check the glove compartment. It's dad's.

92
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Dad's?
Yes.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,900
I keep it charged in case
any of his old contacts call.

94
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,000
Hello?

95
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,700
Yes, this is Edgar Casey.

96
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,400
Nono, no, no. Don't -Don't call
the police. I'll handle this myself.

97
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,100
Thanks.

98
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,100
You know, can you just -Can
you just lock it back up for me?

99
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,700
Great.

100
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,800
Uh, I, uh -I don't have
my-My book in front of me.

101
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,100
Do you -Do you have
the address so I can...

102
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,700
Sure. Okay.

103
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,900
Go ahead.

104
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,000
Right.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,900
Thanks a lot.

106
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,700
Dad ever tell you he kept a
container at a storage place?

107
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
What?
Outside of buffalo.

108
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,900
No way.

109
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,700
Yeah.

110
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,300
And someone just broke into it.

111
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,800
So, you've got no hard
evidence on this Winchester guy?

112
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,200
You're just working
off Gordon's instincts.

113
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
You ever hunt with Gordon?

114
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
No. I heard he's good.

115
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
Good?

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,600
He's the best.

117
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,700
Saved my ass more
times than I can count.

118
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,600
So, if he says Sam
Winchester's dangerous,

119
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
I believe him.

120
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,800
He's gonna be covering his tracks.

121
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
Won't be easy to find.

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,400
Last I got puts him in
Nebraska three weeks back.

123
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,700
Not exactly a fresh lead.

124
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,600
He ain't invisible, Creedie.

125
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Some hunter out there knows something.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,100
So we start calling our contacts.

127
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
All we need is one break.

128
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,100
Don't play with my jesus.

129
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Man.

130
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
What?

131
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Just dad. You know, him and his secrets.

132
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,400
We spent all this time with this guy,

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
And it's like we barely
even know the man.

134
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,000
Well, we're about to learn something.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
No demons allowed.

136
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Blood.

137
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
Check this out.

138
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
Whoever broke in here got attacked.

139
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Dear, old dad.

140
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,800
I got two sets of boot tracks.

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
It looks like it was a two-Man job.

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
And our friend with
the buckshot in him --

143
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,800
It looks like he kept walking.

144
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
So, what's the deal?

145
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
Dad would do work here or something?

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,900
Living the high life, as usual.

147
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
1995.

148
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
No way!

149
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,200
That's my division
championship soccer trophy.

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
I can't believe he kept this.

151
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
It was the probably the closest
you ever came to being a boy.

152
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,200
Oh, wow!

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
It's my first sawed-Off.
I made it myself.

154
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,000
Sixth grade.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,700
Holy crap.

156
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,100
Look at this. He had land mines...

157
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,800
Which they didn't take.

158
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,000
Or the guns.

159
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
Guess they knew what
they were after, huh?

160
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
Hey, Dean, check this out.

161
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
See these symbols?

162
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,100
He used binding magic.

163
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
These are curse boxes.

164
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,000
Curse boxes?

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
They're supposed to keep
the evil mojo in, right?

166
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Kind of like the pandora deal.

167
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Yeah, they're built to contain
the power of the cursed object.

168
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Dad's journal did mention
a whole bunch of stuff,

169
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,100
You know, dangerous,
hexed items, fetishes.

170
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,500
He never did say where they ended up.

171
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,200
Yeah.

172
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
This must be his toxic-Waste dump.

173
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
One box is missing.

174
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,900
Great.

175
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,300
Well, maybe they didn't open it.

176
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,500
Come on, man. Let's open it.

177
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Shut up about the damn box!

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Do you see what's happening here?

179
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,200
I'm literally bleeding to death.

180
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
I'm gonna open it.
Grossman...

181
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,300
Look, what if this is
really worth something?

182
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,800
What, we should just
hand it over to her?

183
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,700
We took all the risk.

184
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Hell, Wayne,

185
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,200
You got shot,

186
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,600
And all for a lousy few hundred bucks.

187
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,600
Now, we could make more selling
whatever it is ourselves.

188
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,700
Huh?

189
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,400
Are you kidding me?

190
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,700
Are you kidding me?!

191
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,200
It's a rabbit's foot.

192
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,300
It's a rabbit's foot, grossman!

193
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm gonna die for a damn rabbit's foot.

194
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Oh.

195
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Hey, foster.

196
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,600
Hey, listen, guys, not
to be a drag or nothing,

197
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
But it's 6:00 in the morning.

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,700
Right.
Can't you guys keep it down?

199
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,300
No, we just got a situation
here is all. Sorry.

200
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
What the hell happened to you?

201
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,600
A shotgun happened to me.

202
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
Hey, grossman,
Yeah?

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Under my sink, there's a medical kit.

204
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,500
And get some water boiling.

205
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
I used to be an army
medic, you know, in nam.

206
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,700
So, I guess this is your lucky day.

207
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,100
Connecticut.

208
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,900
Last three
digits 8-8-0.

209
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,900
Yep. That's it.

210
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,600
Should have blacked out their plates

211
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Before they parked in front
of the security camera.

212
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Four kings.

213
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
You see that?

214
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

215
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Deal it up again.

216
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Royal flush.

217
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,500
Grossman, that's the second
royal flush in eight hands.

218
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,300
I can't lose.

219
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,100
I mean, really, i-I can't lose.

220
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
I think this thing really works.

221
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,800
You know what I'm saying?

222
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,300
I'll tell you one thing
-There's no way in hell

223
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
We are handing it over
to that stuck-Up bitch.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,900
Freeze!
Freeze!

225
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,700
Nobody move!

226
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,100
Don't move.
Don't move!

227
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,400
What is it?
Stop!

228
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
All right. Give us the box.

229
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
Please tell me
that you didn't --

230
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh, they did.

231
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You opened it?!

232
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Are you guys cops?

233
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,700
Huh?
Are you guys cops?!

234
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,000
What was in the box?

235
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Oh, was that it, huh? It was, wasn't it?

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What is that thing?

237
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,000
Sorry.

238
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,800
Dean...

239
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
I got it.

240
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
No, you don't.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
Damn!

242
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,300
Whoa!

243
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,900
Sam!

244
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
That's a lucky break.

245
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
Is that a rabbit's foot?

246
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,000
I think it is.

247
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,400
Huh.

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,100
I'm not finding anything
on it in dad's journal.

249
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,500
Dean, come on.
What?

250
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,600
Hey, that was my gun he
was aiming at your head.

251
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
And my gun don't jam, so
that was a lucky break.

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Not to mention them taking
themselves out -Also a lucky break.

253
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
Here. Scratch one.

254
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Come on, Sam.

255
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,400
Scratch and win.

256
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Look, Dean, it's got
to be cursed somehow.

257
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,900
Otherwise, dad wouldn't
have locked it up.

258
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,500
$1,200.

259
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,600
You just won $1,200.

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
Whoo!

261
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't know, man. It doesn't
seem that cursed to me.

262
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
Grossman?

263
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,800
Grossman, get up.

264
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,600
Hey...

265
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,300
Grossman, get up.

266
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,200
Hey.

267
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Hey...

268
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,300
Grossman?

269
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,200
Oh.

270
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,000
Ahhh!

271
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh, man.

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,300
Now, look, Bobby, we didn't know.

273
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
You touched it? Damn it, Sam.

274
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, dad never told
us about this thing.

275
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,600
I mean, you knew about a
storage place in Black Rock?

276
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,100
His lockup? Yeah, I knew.

277
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,200
Hell, I built those curse boxes for him.

278
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,700
Listen, you have got a serious problem.

279
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,300
That rabbit's foot ain't
no dime-Store notion.

280
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,200
It's real hoodoo
-Old-World stuff.

281
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,700
Made by a baton rouge conjure
woman about 100 years ago.

282
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
It's a hell of a luck charm.

283
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,200
It's not a luck charm. It's a curse.

284
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100
She made it to kill people, Sam.

285
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,100
See,

286
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,500
You touch it, you own it.

287
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,400
You own it, sure, you get a run
of good luck to beat the devil.

288
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,300
But...

289
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,800
You lose it, that luck turns.

290
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,800
It turns so bad that
you're dead inside a week.

291
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
So, I won't lose it, Bobby.

292
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,700
Everybody loses it!

293
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,500
Well, then, how do we break the curse?

294
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know if you can.

295
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,200
Let me look through my
library and make some calls.

296
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
Just sit tight.

297
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Dude,

298
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
We're up 15 grand.

299
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,500
Don't worry.

300
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,100
Bobby will find a way to break it.

301
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Till then, I say we hit vegas,
pull a little "rain man."

302
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,900
You can be rain man.

303
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,300
We just lay low until
Bobby calls back, okay?

304
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,100
Hi. Uh, table for two, please.

305
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,500
Congratulations!

306
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,700
Say that again?

307
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,100
You are the one millionth guest of
the Biggerson's restaurant family.

308
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
Right. If you hear
anything, give me a call.

309
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,700
Well, that clears my book.

310
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,200
The word's out.

311
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,800
Now we wait.

312
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,300
Now we eat.

313
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Good idea.

314
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,900
What do you like? I
got canned everything.

315
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,600
No, no, man. Not eating in the r.V.

316
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
Look, I know a good place.

317
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,600
Wide menu, good service,
homey atmosphere...

318
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Garlic knots.

319
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
The menu's on their website.

320
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,700
Bobby's right.

321
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,700
This lore goes way back.

322
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Pure hoodoo.

323
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
You can't just cut one off any rabbit.

324
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,800
It has to be in a cemetery

325
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,600
Under a full moon on a friday the 13th.

326
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,900
I think from now on,

327
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
We only go to places with Biggerson's.

328
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,800
Can I freshen you up?

329
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,400
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

330
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,800
Thanks.

331
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
Oh.
Oh.

332
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,200
Oh, I -No, don't worry.
That's okay. That's -I got it.

333
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
It's no trouble, really.

334
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
Okay.

335
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Sorry about that.

336
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
It's all right.

337
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,800
Dude,

338
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,900
If you were ever gonna get lucky...

339
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,700
Chill out.

340
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,100
Oh! Oh, jeez!

341
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Sorry.

342
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,500
How was that good?

343
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,000
Son of a bitch.

344
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,700
Come on.

345
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,900
Whoa!

346
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Wow.

347
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
You suck.

348
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,900
So, what, now your luck turns bad?

349
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,300
I guess.

350
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,600
I wonder how bad.

351
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,300
Looks good.

352
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,600
I like that when they drop
the whole onion in the fryer.

353
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
Nearest location...

354
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,700
You seeing that?

355
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,400
Yes, I am.

356
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,300
Adios, compadre..

357
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,300
Oh, man.

358
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,200
What do you want?

359
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,500
Heard about your friend.

360
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
It's bad luck.

361
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,700
Piss off.

362
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,000
We know someone hired you
to steal the rabbit's foot --

363
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,800
A woman.

364
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,900
Yeah?

365
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
How do you know that?

366
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Because she just stole it back from us.

367
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,500
Listen, man,
this is --

368
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Sam, you okay?

369
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,300
Yeah. I'm good.

370
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,700
I want you to tell us her name.

371
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,900
Screw you.

372
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
It wasn't a freak accident
that killed your partner.

373
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,300
What?

374
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,800
It was the rabbit's foot.

375
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,300
You're crazy, man.

376
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
You know I'm not.

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
You saw what happened,
what it did --

378
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
All the flukes, all the luck.

379
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,100
When you lose the foot,
that luck goes sour.

380
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
That's what killed your friend.

381
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,600
And my brother here is next,

382
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,300
And who knows how many more
innocent people after that.

383
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,500
Now, if you don't help
us stop this thing,

384
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
Then that puts those
deaths on your head.

385
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,900
Now, I can read people...

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,800
And I get it.

387
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,100
You're a thief and a scumbag.

388
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,000
That's fine.

389
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,800
But you're not a killer...

390
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Are you?

391
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,200
No one saw which way they went,

392
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,600
And their meal was free, so
there's no credit-Card trail.

393
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,000
Don't worry. We'll find them.

394
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,500
What makes you so sure?

395
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,500
'Cause there's a higher
power at work here.

396
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,300
I know it now.

397
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Hello.

398
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,500
Dean, great news.

399
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,900
Wasn't easy, but I found a heavyweight
cleansing ritual that should do the trick.

400
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Bobby, that's, uh,
great, except Sam, uh...

401
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,200
...Sam lost the foot.

402
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,300
He what?

403
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,200
Bobby, listen, listen.

404
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,400
This hot chick stole it from him.

405
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
I'm serious.

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,900
In her mid-20s, and
she was sharp, you know?

407
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,600
Good enough of a con to play us.

408
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
And she only gave the
guys she hired a name --

409
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,400
Probably an alias or something.

410
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,900
Luigi or something.

411
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,300
Lugosi.

412
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Lugosi?

413
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Lugosi.

414
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,500
Oh, crap. It's probably Bela.

415
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,000
Bela Lugosi? That's cute.

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Bela talbot's her real name.

417
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,900
Crossed paths with her once or twice.

418
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,700
She knew about the rabbit's
foot. Is she a hunter?

419
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,500
Pretty friggin' far from a hunter,

420
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,400
But she knows her way
around the territory.

421
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,700
She's been out of the country.

422
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,000
Last I heard, she was in
the middle east someplace.

423
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,500
I guess she's back.

424
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,300
Which means seriously bad luck for you.

425
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Great.

426
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,500
But if it is Bela,

427
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,600
At least I might know some
folks who know where to find her.

428
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
Thanks, Bobby, again.

429
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,700
Just look out for your
brother, you idjit.

430
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
What?

431
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
I lost my shoe.

432
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,300
All right, Bobby, thanks.
Hey, we owe you...another one.

433
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,900
All right, Bobby's got it
on pretty good authority

434
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,500
That this Bela chick lives in queens.

435
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
So it will take me about
two hours to get there.

436
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,300
So, what are we doing then?

437
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
You, my brother, are staying here,

438
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
'Cause I don't want your
bad luck getting us killed.

439
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,300
What am I even supposed to do, Dean?

440
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,900
Nothing. Nothing. Come here.

441
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,100
I don't want you doing anything.

442
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,500
I want you to sit right here

443
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,500
And don't move, okay?

444
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
Don't turn on the light.
Don't turn off the light.

445
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,600
Don't even scratch your nose.

446
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,400
Because you shook on 1.5.

447
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Well, maybe I should just
take it somewhere else.

448
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,400
Don't threaten me, luke.

449
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,400
Despite your reputation,
you don't scare me.

450
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,200
Well, I'm glad you see it that way.

451
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,300
I'll see you at the airstrip in an hour.

452
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,100
???

453
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
Oh, come
on. I--

454
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,400
I
didn't --

455
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,500
Ah!

456
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,600
You're gonna give it back.

457
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,100
Sweetie,

458
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
No, I'm not.

459
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah? We'll see.

460
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
Bela, right?

461
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,200
That's right...

462
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,800
Dean.

463
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
You know the thing's cursed, don't you?

464
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,600
You'd be surprised what some people
would pay for something like that.

465
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,300
Really?

466
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,900
There's a lucrative market out there.

467
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,000
A lot of money to be made.

468
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,300
You hunters, with all those
amulets and talismans you use

469
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,900
To stop those big,
bad monsters --

470
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,100
Any one of them could put your
children's children through college.

471
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,500
So, you know the truth

472
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,900
About what's really going on out there,

473
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
And this is what you
decide to do with it?

474
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,300
You become a thief.

475
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,300
I procure unique items
for a select clientele.

476
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,300
Yeah.

477
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
A thief.

478
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,700
No.

479
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
A great thief.

480
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
Oh, he's awake.

481
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,100
Back with us, eh?

482
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,900
We didn't even have to touch you.

483
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
??? And knocked yourself out.

484
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,000
It was like watching jerry
lewis trying to stack chairs.

485
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
Who are you?

486
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,200
What do
you wan--

487
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,800
I used to think your
friend Gordon sent me...

488
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,300
Gordon?

489
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh, come on.

490
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,400
...because he asked me to track you down

491
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
And put a bullet in your brain.

492
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,100
Great. That sounds like him.

493
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,800
But

494
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
As it turns out...

495
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,900
I'm on a mission from god.

496
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,500
Look, Bela.

497
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
My brother, he... touched the foot.

498
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,800
And when you took it from
him, his luck went from --

499
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
I know how it works.

500
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,000
So, then you know he's gonna
die unless we can destroy it.

501
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Oh.

502
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,600
You can have the foot...

503
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,100
For $1.5 million.

504
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Nice.

505
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,900
Yeah. I'll just call my banker.

506
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,300
How'd you even find the damn thing,

507
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,400
Stuck in the back of some storage place,

508
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Middle of nowhere?

509
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I just asked a few of the ghosts
of the people it had killed.

510
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,900
They were very tuned in to its location.

511
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,600
So you're only after yourself, huh?

512
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,900
It's all about number one.

513
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,500
Being a hunter is so much more noble?

514
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,100
A bunch of obsessed,
revenge-Driven sociopaths

515
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Trying to save a world
that can't be saved.

516
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,800
Well, aren't you a glass half full.

517
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
We're all going to hell, Dean.

518
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,300
Might as well enjoy the ride.

519
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,900
I actually agree with you there.

520
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,400
Anyhoo, this has been charming,
but, uh, look at the time.

521
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,600
Oh, and...

522
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,600
This.

523
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,100
You're not the only
one with sticky fingers.

524
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,500
If it's any consolation, I think
you're a truly awful person.

525
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,200
You were a part of that demon
plan to open the gate, weren't you?

526
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,500
We did everything we could to stop it.

527
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,000
Lie, lie, lie!

528
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,100
You were in on it.

529
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,200
You know what they're next
move is, too, don't you?

530
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,000
No, I don't, okay? You're
wrong about all of this.

531
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
Where are they gonna hit us next?

532
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,800
Where?!

533
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,800
Gordon told me about you, Sam,

534
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
About your powers.

535
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
You're some kind of
weirdo psychic freak.

536
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
No, not anymore.

537
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I have no powers, no
visions -Nothing.

538
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,900
It just
-Lie!

539
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,900
Now no more lies.

540
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,100
There's an army of demons out there,

541
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,400
Pushing at a world already on the brink.

542
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,000
We're on deck for the
end game here, right?

543
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,600
So maybe,

544
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,000
Just maybe you can understand

545
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,300
Why we can't take chances.

546
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,400
Whoa! Okay, okay.

547
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
Now, hold on a minute.
Kubrick, get...

548
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
No! You saw what happened, Creedie.

549
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
Ask
yourself --

550
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
Why are we here?

551
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,100
Because you saw a picture on the web?

552
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Because we chose this
motel instead of another?

553
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,000
Luck like that doesn't just happen.

554
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,200
Look, I can explain all of that.

555
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Shut up.

556
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,300
It's god, Creedie.

557
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
He led us here
for one reason --

558
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,100
To do his work.

559
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,700
This is destiny.

560
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Whoa.

561
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,800
No.

562
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
No destiny.

563
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,900
Just a rabbit's foot.

564
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,100
Put the gun down, son,

565
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,300
Or you're gonna be
scraping brain off the wall.

566
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,700
Oh, this thing?

567
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, that thing.

568
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Okay.

569
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,300
But, you see, there's something
about me that you don't know.

570
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,700
Yeah? What would that be?

571
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
It's my lucky day.

572
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,200
Oh, my god! Did you see that shot?!

573
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,900
I'm amazing.

574
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
I'm Batman.

575
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Yeah.

576
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,800
You're Batman.

577
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,700
All right.

578
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,200
Bone ash,

579
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,800
Cayenne pepper.

580
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,000
That should do it.

581
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
One second.

582
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,900
Dean
--

583
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,400
Hey, back off, jinx.

584
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,100
I'm bringing home the bacon.

585
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
All right.

586
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,900
Say goodbye to "wascawy wabbit."

587
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,400
I think you'll find that belongs to me.

588
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,200
Or, you know...

589
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,000
Whatever.

590
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,900
Put the foot down, honey.

591
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,700
No.

592
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,700
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

593
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,400
See, I happen to be able to read people.

594
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Okay, you're a thief.
Fine. But you're not --

595
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Oh!

596
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,000
Son
of a --

597
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,900
Back off, tiger.

598
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,800
Back off.

599
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
You make one more move,
and I'll pull the trigger.

600
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,800
You've got the luck,
Dean. You I can't hit.

601
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
But your
brother --

602
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,800
Him I can't miss.

603
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,800
The hell is wrong with you?!

604
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
You don't just do around
shooting people like that!

605
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Relax.

606
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,100
It's a shoulder hit. I can aim.

607
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,200
Besides,

608
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Who here hasn't shot a few people?

609
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,000
Put the rabbit's foot on the ground now.

610
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,900
All right!

611
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,000
All right.

612
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Take it easy.

613
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,500
Think fast.

614
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,500
Damn.

615
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,600
Now,

616
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,100
What do you say we destroy that
ugly-Ass piece of dead thing?

617
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,100
Thanks very much.

618
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,300
I'm out $1.5 million

619
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,700
And on the bad side of a very
powerful, fairly psychotic buyer.

620
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Wow.

621
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,900
I really don't feel bad about that.

622
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,800
Sam?

623
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,700
No.

624
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,500
Not even a little.

625
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,100
Maybe next time,

626
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,400
I'll hang you out to dry.

627
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,500
Oh, don't go away angry. Just go away.

628
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,500
Have a nice night, boys.

629
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
You good?

630
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
I'll live.

631
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,800
I guess we're back to normal now, huh?

632
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,600
No good luck.

633
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,900
No bad luck.

634
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,700
Oh,

635
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,200
I forgot. We're at $46,000.

636
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
I almost forgot about the...

637
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,500
Scratch tickets.

638
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,400
Son of a bitch!

639
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,400
You were right about everything.

640
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,900
Sam Winchester is more than a monster.

641
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,500
He's the adversary.

642
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,700
And what was it that convinced you?

643
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
God led me to him...

644
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
And his will is clear.

645
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,300
Okay.

646
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,900
That's great.

647
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
I'm glad to have you on board.

648
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
But, uh, first things first.

649
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,600
We got to get me the hell out of here.

650
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
'Cause like I told you before,

651
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,200
Sam Winchester must die.
