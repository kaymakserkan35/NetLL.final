1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,790
- Who are you?
- Castiel.

2
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:08,575
I mean what are you?

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,890
I'm an angel of the lord.

4
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:10,830
Some angel you are.

5
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:12,025
My true form

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,360
It can be
overwhelming to humans

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,780
And so can my
real voice...

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,110
But you already knew that.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,760
Certain people -
special people -

10
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,360
Can perceive
my true visage.

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,260
What visage are
you in now, huh?

12
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,270
This? this is... a vessel.

13
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,860
You're possessing
some poor bastard?

14
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:28,375
He's a devout man.

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,555
he actually
prayed for this.

16
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,570
Something major must have
happened while I was downstairs,

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,090
'cause I can't back and -

18
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,540
And you're BFF
with a demon?

19
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,080
Why do you trust
her so much?

20
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,710
Because... she
saved my life.

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,490
Sucking blood? you got
to know that's wrong.

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,820
I wish to god
I could stop.

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,300
We need to talk.

24
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,490
I'm dreaming, aren't I?

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,770
It's not safe here.

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,050
Someplace more private.

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,630
More private? we're
inside my head.

28
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,030
Exactly.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,000
Someone could
be listening.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,660
Cass, what's wrong?

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,520
Meet me here.

32
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,190
Go
- now.

33
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,905
What'd he say, Dean?

34
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,160
What was so important?

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,460
If I knew,
would I be here?

36
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,070
What the hell?

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,800
Looks like a
bomb went off.

38
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,690
There was a fight here.

39
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,390
Between who?

40
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,530
Check it out.

41
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,270
Look familiar?

42
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,210
Yeah, it does.

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,170
Anna used
something like that

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,620
To wish the angels
back to the cornfield.

45
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,350
So, what? Cass was
fighting angels?

46
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,050
I don't know.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,120
Sam.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,920
Cass?

49
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,100
Cass!

50
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,350
Hey! Cass!

51
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,670
What's
- what's going on?

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,070
Just take it
easy. take it easy.

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,180
Cass, you okay?

54
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,210
Castiel?

55
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,980
I'm not Castiel.

56
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,910
It's me.

57
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,810
Who's "me"?

58
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,620
Jimmy.

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,880
My name's Jimmy.

60
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,250
Where the hell is Castiel?

61
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,360
He's gone.

62
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,485
Mind slowing down?

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,590
You're gonna
give me angina.

64
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,450
I'm hungry.

65
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,250
When's the last
time you ate?

66
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,460
I don't know
- months.

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,960
What the hell
happened back there?

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,230
It looked like an
angel battle royal.

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,650
All I remember is there was
a flash of light, and I, uh...

70
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,710
I
- I woke up, and I was just, you know, like, me again.

71
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:33,980
So, what
- Cass just ditched out of your meat suit?

72
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,550
I really don't know.

73
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,620
You remember anything
about being possessed?

74
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,890
Anything at all?

75
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,090
Yeah, bits and pieces.

76
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,255
I mean, angel
inside of you -

77
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,790
It's kind of like being
chained to a comet.

78
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,760
Well, that doesn't
sound like much fun.

79
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,570
Understatement.

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,950
Cass said he wanted
to tell us something.

81
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,500
Please tell me
you remember that.

82
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,310
Sorry.

83
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,120
Come on. what do you know?

84
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,430
My name is Jimmy Novak.

85
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,750
I'm from
Pontiac, Illinois.

86
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,290
And I have a family.

87
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,690
Claire.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
Bless this food, o lord,

89
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,300
And ourselves to
thy loving service,

90
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,940
That we may always continue
in thy faith and fear

91
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,560
To the honor and
glory of thy name.

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,750
- Amen.
- Amen.

93
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,990
I can see my
head sticking out

94
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,140
From underneath
the front bumper.

95
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,340
My eyes were closed.

96
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,450
My head was turned
to the right side.

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,120
And on each side of me
is an angel, and, uh...

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,660
blank

99
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,480
So, what do we do?

100
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,815
What do you mean? the
guy's got a family.

101
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,300
We buy him a bus
ticket, send him home.

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,530
I don't know about that.

103
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,470
Dean, he's the
only lead we got.

104
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,360
He doesn't know anything.

105
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,770
Are you 100% about that?

106
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,900
You think he's lying?

107
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,250
Well, you want to go
Guantanamo on the guy?

108
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,870
Dean, maybe he doesn't
even know what he knows.

109
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,530
I say at least we
get him to Bobby's.

110
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,020
Maybe all he needs is -
is hypnosis or a p-psychic,

111
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,460
Or, hell, maybe Cass will
just drop back into him.

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,060
I don't know, man.

113
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,390
Dean, back there, that was
angel-on-angel violence.

114
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,270
Now, I don't know
what's going on,

115
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:03,810
but it's big,

116
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,300
And we can't just let the only
lead we've got just skip out.

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,660
What?

118
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,550
Remember when our job
was helping people -

119
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,540
Like getting them
back to their family?

120
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:14,870
You think I don't
want to help him?

121
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,845
I'm just being realistic.

122
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,110
I mean, hell, we're
doing him a favor.

123
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:17,595
How?!

124
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,370
Dean, if we want
to question the guy,

125
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,070
You can damn well bet
the demons do, too.

126
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,750
What the hell are you talking
about, I can't go home?

127
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,790
There's a good chance you
have a bull's-eye on your back.

128
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,720
What?

129
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,040
From who?

130
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,395
Demons.

131
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,505
Oh, come on. that's crazy.

132
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,580
What do they want with me?

133
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,100
I don't know
- information, maybe.

134
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,670
I don't know anything!

135
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,670
I know, but -

136
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,240
Look, I'm done, okay?

137
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,460
With demons, angels
- all of it.

138
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:45,520
I just want to go home.

139
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,475
We understand.

140
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,890
No, I don't think
that you do understand.

141
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,740
I've been shot and
stabbed and healed,

142
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,580
And my body's been
dragged all over the earth.

143
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,550
By some miracle, I'm
out, and I am done.

144
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,620
I've given enough, okay?

145
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,220
Look, all we're saying is
that until we figure this out,

146
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,160
The safest
place is with us.

147
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,190
How long?

148
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,720
We'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

149
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,030
Where you going?

150
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,730
To see my wife
and daughter, okay?

151
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,030
No, you're not.

152
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,870
You're just gonna put
those people in danger.

153
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,140
So, what
- now I'm a prisoner?

154
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,010
Harsh way to put it.

155
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Dean!

156
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,840
Would you hurry up?

157
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,110
Sorry
- uh, this is funny to you?

158
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,680
Mr. big bad prison guard,

159
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,710
And Jimmy McMook
gives you the slip?

160
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,210
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

161
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,920
What were you
doing, anyway?

162
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,380
I was getting a coke.

163
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,320
Was it a refreshing coke?

164
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,490
Can we just go, please?

165
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,770
- What the hell are you doing?!
- It's okay. I'm okay.

166
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,780
Jimmy.

167
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
Look.

168
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,240
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong.

169
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,380
He asked me to do it.

170
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,780
Who asked you to do it?

171
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,550
Castiel.

172
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,090
To prove my faith.

173
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,560
Look.

174
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,190
I'm fine.

175
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,890
It's a miracle.

176
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,730
Who's Castiel?

177
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,270
Hey, guys.

178
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,680
Geez!

179
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,180
Smooth.

180
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,880
You ever try
calling ahead?

181
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,850
I like the element
of surprise.

182
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,450
You look terrific.

183
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,790
Um... yeah.

184
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,020
Not the most
appropriate time, Dean.

185
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,290
You let Jimmy get away?

186
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,460
Talk to ginormo here.

187
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,330
Sam...

188
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,270
You seem... different.

189
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,840
Me? I don't know. Haircut?

190
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,110
That's not what
I'm talking about.

191
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,280
So, what'd Jimmy tell
you? he remember anything?

192
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,820
Why? what's going on?

193
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,290
It's Cass. He got
sent back home.

194
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,490
Well, more like
dragged back.

195
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,660
To heaven?

196
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,190
That's not a good thing?

197
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,600
No. That's a
very bad thing.

198
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,300
Painfully, awfully bad.

199
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,430
He must have seriously
pissed someone off.

200
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,540
Cass said he had something to
tell me, something important.

201
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,340
- What?
- I don't know.

202
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,710
Does Jimmy know?

203
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,140
I don't think so.

204
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,310
You don't think so?

205
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,050
Whatever it is, it's huge.

206
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,920
You got to find
out for sure.

207
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,880
That's why we're
going after Jimmy.

208
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,990
That's why you shouldn't have
let him go in the first place.

209
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,020
He's... probably
dead already.

210
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,100
Take the pills.

211
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,030
I'm not sick.

212
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,800
Jimmy, take the pills.

213
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,900
I know that this is
hard to understand...

214
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,870
But he chose me.

215
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,140
Castiel the angel?

216
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,210
He's spoken
to me now, Ames

217
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,610
A dozen times.

218
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,250
Hey, you believe
in god, don't you?

219
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,050
What kind of question
is that? of course.

220
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,790
And angels?

221
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,120
Yes, Jimmy.

222
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,990
So, why is it, then, so
hard for you to believe

223
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,190
That they're
talking to me?

224
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,130
Jimmy, you sell ad
time for a. m. radio.

225
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,590
No, he said that I'm
special, it's in my blood.

226
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,960
W
- what does that mean, it's in your blood? hmm?

227
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,260
He didn't say.

228
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,300
He just said that god has
chosen me for a higher purpose.

229
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,600
To do what?

230
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,040
You know, it's god's will.

231
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,110
Not really my place
to question it.

232
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,680
Hey, come here.

233
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,290
This is a blessing.

234
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,420
This is the most important
thing to ever happen to me.

235
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,160
I thought we were the
most important things

236
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,330
To ever happen to you.

237
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,490
Hey, have faith.

238
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,530
Jimmy... you're
scaring me.

239
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,000
God will provide.

240
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,170
If you won't take your pills
and if you won't get help...

241
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,240
... then I'm gonna take Claire
to my mother's in the morning.

242
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,360
so, I want to help you.

243
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,690
I'm about to lose
my... my family here

244
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,060
If you don't tell me how.

245
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,360
Please, Castiel,
just talk to me.

246
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,460
What do you want from me?

247
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,280
Yes, I understand.

248
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,780
Promise my family will
be okay, and I'll do it.

249
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,590
Then... yes.

250
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,220
Daddy?

251
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,000
I am not your father.

252
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,610
We, uh...

253
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,610
We stopped
looking for you.

254
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,380
I'm so sorry.

255
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,210
You were dead.

256
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,520
We, uh, we thought
you were dead.

257
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,190
I'm okay.

258
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,560
Claire, room, now.

259
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,500
Can I see her?

260
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,040
Oh... no.

261
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,410
I don't know yet.

262
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,580
It's been almost
a year, you know?

263
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,580
I know.

264
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,320
Think your daughter would have
wanted to know you were okay.

265
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,720
I was in a psych clinic.

266
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,330
I just wanted to get myself
straight before seeing you.

267
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,100
And no telephones, or...?

268
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,640
No. I know. You're
right. I'm...

269
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,210
I'm so sorry.

270
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,710
But it's all,
it's all over now.

271
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,510
I mean, I'm...
I'm really okay.

272
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,410
What does that mean?

273
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,450
I... I was, I was
confused, Amelia.

274
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,260
I was completely
delusional.

275
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,460
And I thought, I thought god
was calling me to something,

276
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,460
And I thought that
it was important.

277
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,600
And...

278
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,600
I was wrong.

279
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,540
I was such an idiot.

280
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,410
Heaven, hell...

281
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,610
None of that matters.

282
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,950
The only thing that's important
to me is you and Claire.

283
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,800
And I, uh...

284
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,970
I can't undo
what I've done.

285
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,640
But I just want
to come home again.

286
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,940
I don't know if
I can do that.

287
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,980
Not yet.

288
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,750
I mean, whatever
you're comfortable with.

289
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,530
Maybe we could start
with something smaller?

290
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,160
Like what?

291
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,030
I don't know.

292
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,070
Dinner?

293
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,630
where the hell
are you, Ruby?

294
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,940
This isn't funny anymore.

295
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,510
I'm all out.

296
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,040
Stop whatever
you're doing.

297
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,510
Call me.

298
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,680
I need more.

299
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,750
Hi, daddy.

300
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,120
Hi, baby.

301
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,470
Okay, so, we have
turkey and roast beef.

302
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,600
Better be okay.
it's all we have.

303
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,040
It's fine.

304
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,940
It's more than fine.

305
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,080
Shall we sit?

306
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,410
Yeah.

307
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,490
It's perfect.

308
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,490
Daddy... aren't
you gonna say grace?

309
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,940
no, honey, I
don't think I am.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,700
Why are you crying?

311
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,880
'cause I'm happy.

312
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,820
Hey, Roger.

313
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,290
Hey, Ames. how you doing?

314
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,290
Good.

315
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,860
Am I crazy, or
did I just see

316
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,360
Your husband wander in
here about half an hour ago?

317
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,930
Yeah, uh, you did.

318
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,700
But, Roger, now's
not a good time -

319
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,330
Hey. there he is.

320
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,700
Son of a bitch. what
the hell happened to you?

321
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,570
Uh... long story.

322
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,040
But it's over.

323
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,040
Yeah?

324
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm good.

325
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,980
Can I talk to you?

326
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,080
Can I get you a beer?

327
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,080
That'd be good.

328
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,850
Thanks.

329
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,420
get in here.

330
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,490
Buddy, you scared the hell
out of a lot of people.

331
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,090
I know, I know.

332
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,660
So, really, what happened?

333
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,930
Honestly?

334
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,990
Worst year of my life,

335
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,730
And you wouldn't
believe a word of it.

336
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,400
But... it's all okay now.

337
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,570
Swear.

338
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,600
Actually, no, it's not.

339
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,870
What do you mean?

340
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,810
Well, I mean, I'm gonna gut
your daughter while you watch.

341
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,340
Here you go.

342
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
What are you doing?!

343
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,250
- He's a demon!
- Jimmy, stop!

344
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,780
- Run! run!
- stop it!

345
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,320
- Where is it?
- Roger was your best friend.

346
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,650
Roger was a demon.

347
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,060
Don't cross this line.

348
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,590
Jimmy, you thought you were
better. but you are so sick.

349
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,490
- Look, I'm not crazy.
- stay the hell away from us!

350
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,230
- Just stay the hell away from us!
- this is very, very real.

351
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,400
Claire! no! run!

352
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,970
Leave her alone!

353
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,200
Please stay there!

354
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,530
Claire!

355
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
Damn it!

356
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,880
Hey, pal.

357
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,730
- Told you I'd gut the bitch.
- Roger.

358
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,410
- Daddy?
- just let her go, okay?

359
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,010
Now, me
- I would.

360
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,550
But the missus
- she has other ideas.

361
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,980
Daddy!

362
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,890
Oh, my god.

363
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,760
No!

364
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,100
go! get them out of here!

365
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,140
Go! go!

366
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,640
Can't get it
up, can you, Sam?

367
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,510
No, but I can.

368
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,560
Come on, come on, come on.

369
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,360
Oh, my god.

370
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,260
- Where's your wife?
- right here.

371
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,130
Let's go!

372
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,440
You were right.

373
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,740
Sorry we were.

374
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,450
But I'm telling you
- I don't know anything.

375
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,180
I don't think they're
inclined to believe you.

376
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,950
And even if they
did, you're a vessel.

377
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,290
They're still gonna want
to know what makes you tick.

378
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,160
Which means vivisection...
if they're feeling generous.

379
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,090
I'm gonna tell
you once again -

380
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,290
You're putting your
family in danger.

381
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,790
You have to come with us.

382
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,880
How long?

383
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,730
And don't give me that "cross that
bridge when we get to it" crap.

384
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,170
Don't you get it?

385
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,180
Forever.

386
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,440
The demons
will never stop.

387
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,270
You can never be
with your family.

388
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,920
So, you either get as far
away from them as possible

389
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,520
Or you put a
bullet in your head,

390
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,420
And that's how you
keep your family safe,

391
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,920
But there's no getting out
and there's no going home.

392
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,255
Well, don't
sugarcoat it, Sam.

393
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,030
I'm just telling
him the truth, Dean.

394
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,190
Someone has to.

395
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,480
So... I pretty much owe you
the biggest apology ever.

396
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,640
No, you don't.

397
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,980
Yes. I do.

398
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,180
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.

399
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,520
And I will never,
ever forgive myself

400
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,260
For letting you
walk out that door.

401
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,190
Well, you did what any
rational person would have done.

402
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,630
I mean, hell, I thought
I was crazy half the time.

403
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,570
So... demons, huh?

404
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,040
Yeah.

405
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,810
Can we...

406
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,810
Can we even
go home, or...?

407
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,180
What are we gonna do?

408
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,520
These boys are
gonna get you a car.

409
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,690
Don't ask me how.

410
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,960
And you're gonna take
Claire to Carl and Sally's

411
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,160
As fast as you can.

412
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,390
Wait. what about you?

413
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,270
No. I-I'm not going
anywhere without you, Jimmy.

414
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,000
Listen to me.

415
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,800
Every moment
that I'm with you,

416
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,540
You and Claire
are in danger.

417
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,340
I don't care. we are
not splitting up again.

418
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,610
We don't have a choice.

419
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,180
For how long?

420
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,850
We'll... cross that
bridge when we get to it.

421
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,330
we're family.

422
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,800
They will kill
you, Amelia.

423
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,100
And they'll kill Claire.

424
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,610
You just have to get as
far away from me as you can.

425
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,920
Okay, so, uh...
here's your car.

426
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,300
Take care of your
mom, okay, bub?

427
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,460
Why is he leaving again?

428
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,130
This is just not
my day, is it?

429
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,340
You little bitch.

430
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,410
What the hell
happened back there?

431
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,320
What?

432
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,350
You practically fainted
trying to gank a demon.

433
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,760
Okay, I didn't faint.

434
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,160
I got a little dizzy.

435
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,660
Well, you can call
it whatever you want.

436
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,060
Point is, you used to be
strong enough to kill Alastair.

437
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,230
Now you can't even kill
stunt demon number three?

438
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:20,470
What do you want me
to say about it, Dean?

439
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,200
For starters, what's
going on with your mojo?

440
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,040
I mean, it's yo-yo'ing
all over the place.

441
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,540
Now, I'm not trying to
pick a fight here, okay?

442
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,510
I just - y-you're
scaring me, man.

443
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,840
I'm scaring myself.

444
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
Hello?

445
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,620
Who is this?

446
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,390
It's your wife.

447
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,960
Amelia?

448
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,440
Oh, my god.

449
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,770
All right, they're
expecting you to come alone.

450
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,310
That's exactly what
you're gonna do.

451
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,440
We'll work our way
through the catwalks.

452
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,080
We'll be right behind you.

453
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,880
All you got to do is stay calm
and stall and let us do our job.

454
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,110
You want me to stay calm?

455
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,850
This is my family
we're talking about.

456
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,280
Listen to me
- this will work.

457
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,050
You understand?
nobody's gonna get hurt.

458
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,890
Whatever.

459
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,520
Give me a minute, okay?

460
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,960
There's no way they're expecting
him to come alone, Dean.

461
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,270
You know this is
probably a trap.

462
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,770
Yeah, I know.

463
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,430
That's why I have a plan.

464
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,910
Castiel, you
son of a bitch!

465
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,980
You promised me my
family would be okay!

466
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,350
You promised you were
gonna take care of them!

467
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,950
I've gave you everything
you asked me to give!

468
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,950
I gave you more!

469
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,290
This is the thanks I get?

470
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,450
This is what you do?

471
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,790
Your heaven?!

472
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,090
Help me, please!

473
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,690
You promised, Cass!

474
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,560
Just help me!

475
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,310
Typical.

476
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,460
Hi, honey. you're home.

477
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,330
Listen, I'm...

478
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,460
I'm begging you here.

479
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,900
You d-do whatever
you want with me...

480
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,030
But my wife and
daughter, they're just -

481
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,440
They're not a
part of this.

482
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,300
Oh, they're a big
part of this, Jimmy.

483
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,440
And p. s.
- you should have come alone.

484
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,680
I am alone.

485
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,850
Oh, you're such a liar.

486
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,210
Like I didn't think you'd
bring heckle and jeckle.

487
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,380
Damn it.

488
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,620
Nice plan, Dean.

489
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,520
Yeah, well, nobody
bats a thousand.

490
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,360
Got the knife?

491
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,760
And you know what's funny?

492
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,160
You wearing a soccer mom?

493
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,300
Is I was actually bummed
to get this detail.

494
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,300
Picking up an
empty vessel?

495
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,830
Sort of like a milk run.

496
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,670
Now look who
landed in my lap.

497
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah, well...

498
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,870
You got us, okay?

499
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,240
Let these people go.

500
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,880
Oh, Sam.

501
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,410
It's easy to
act chivalrous

502
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,310
When your wonder girl
powers aren't working, huh?

503
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,650
Now for the punch line -

504
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,050
Everybody dies.

505
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,700
Waste little orphan annie.

506
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,440
Castiel.

507
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,820
Of course we
keep our promises.

508
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,820
Of course you
have our gratitude.

509
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,920
You served us well.

510
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,130
Your work is done.

511
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,960
It's time to go home now
- your real home.

512
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,000
You'll rest forever in
the fields of the lord.

513
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,400
No.

514
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,540
Rest now, Jimmy.

515
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,010
No. Claire.

516
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,840
She's with me now.

517
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,080
She's chosen.

518
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,350
It's in her blood,
as it was in yours.

519
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,980
please, Castiel.

520
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,250
I mean, just
- just take me.

521
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,150
Take me, please.

522
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,760
I want to make
sure you understand.

523
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,760
You won't die... or age.

524
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,800
If this last year
was painful for you,

525
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,670
Picture a hundred
- a thousand more like it.

526
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,000
Doesn't matter.

527
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,410
You take me.

528
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,440
Just take me.

529
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,720
As you wish.

530
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,560
Cass, hold up.

531
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,230
What were you
gonna tell me?

532
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,330
I learned my lesson
while I was away, Dean.

533
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,740
I serve heaven.
I don't serve man.

534
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,110
And I certainly
don't serve you.

535
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,370
All right.

536
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,910
Let's hear it.

537
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,910
What?

538
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,180
Drop the bomb, man.

539
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,910
You saw what I did. come on.
stop the car. take a swing.

540
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,380
I'm not gonna
take a swing.

Then scream. chew me out.

542
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,290

543
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,890
Oh, come on.

544
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
No.

545
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,530
Right. look, at least
let me explain myself.

546
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,260
Don't.

547
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,460
I don't care.

548
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,700
You don't care?

549
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,540
What do you want me to say
- that I'm disappointed?

550
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,340
Yeah, I am.

551
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,440
But mostly, I'm
just tired, man.

552
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,910
And I'm done.

553
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,710
I am just done.

554
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,420

This is for your own good.

566

I'm not drinking the
demon blood for kicks.

573
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,600
I'm getting strong
enough to kill Lilith.

All the seals falling.

00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,090
Except one.

serves of the god and his angels.

demon blood. I won't do it.

580
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,900
I won't let my brother
