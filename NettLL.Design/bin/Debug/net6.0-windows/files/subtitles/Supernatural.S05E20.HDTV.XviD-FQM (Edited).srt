1
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,768
What would I do without you?

2
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:07,408
No!

3
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:09,768
Something turned
him into a monster.

4
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:11,068
What are we dealing
with, do you know?

5
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,168
Croatoan.

6
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:13,768
It's a virus. Of,
plague and pestilence.

7
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:15,768
Who knows how far
this thing can spread?

8
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:20,968
It's Crowley, right?

9
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:25,968
Why exactly would
you want the devil dead?

10
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:27,268
Survival.

11
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:30,968
If Lucifer manages to
exterminate human kind...

12
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:32,168
we're next.

13
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:34,068
The cage you
sprung Lucifer from...

14
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:35,568
you can shove his ass back in.

15
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,368
The key to the cage... four rings...

16
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:38,868
from the Horsemen.

17
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:41,068
Well, we got War's.

18
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:43,768
We nicked Famine's.

19
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,338
That's two rings down.
Collect all four.

20
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:48,440
All we need is,
Pestilence and Death.

21
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,041
Oh, is that all?

22
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:04,456
Doctor

23
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:05,690
Doctor

24
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:08,727
It's a load of crap...
pure profit-driven crap.

25
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:11,062
Well, swine flu...
it's an epidemic.

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,131
Yeah, well, if Niveus was really
worried about the epidemic,

27
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,933
they'd be giving the vaccine
out for free.

28
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,701
This supposed new formula...

29
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,236
Well, they say
it's faster-acting.

30
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:21,039
Well maybe it is,
but human trials this week?

31
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,707
Yeah, it does seem
a little rushed.

32
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,175
A <i>little</i> rushed?

33
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:25,944
Have you even seen
the new vaccine?

34
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:27,545
- No.
- Yeah, neither have I.

35
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:29,080
I have.

36
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:31,916
Who the hell are you?

37
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:34,219
I'm running the experiment.

38
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:35,553
Ohh!

39
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:38,790
What the hell?!

40
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:42,694
Relax... you're part of it, too.

41
00:01:57,843 --> 00:02:00,678
Aah! Aah! Get off of me!

42
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,181
God, no! Get off!
Aah!

43
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:10,822
Well, looks like it works.

44
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,363
  Season 5 Episode 20
 "The Devil You Know"

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,169
<i>Paging Dr. Stateman.</i>
<i>Dr. Stateman, please.</i>

46
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:29,741
Hey, check it out...
I look like the king of pop.

47
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:31,142
Too soon..?

48
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,477
Too soon.

49
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:34,813
Don't get me wrong...
I'm glad the CDC is here,

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,347
but what we really need is vaccine.

51
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:38,882
- Yeah, you got that right.
- Well, tell me...

52
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:41,119
have you noticed anything
unusual about the strain...

53
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:42,921
any signs of behavioral change?

54
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:45,755
- Like aggression, maybe?
- Excuse me?

55
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:48,126
Have the flu victims
shown any signs of, uh,

56
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:49,294
homicidal tendencies?

57
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:52,063
Um...

58
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,732
Symptomatically speaking,
we're looking at

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,469
a relatively mild case
of swine flu here.

60
00:02:57,536 --> 00:03:00,305
Probably add up to
a miserable week off of work,

61
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:01,439
and that's about it.

62
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:02,540
So nothing unusual.

63
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:04,275
Hmm.

64
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,311
Day and a half ago,
we didn't have a single case.

65
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:07,946
Now we're looking
at over 70.

66
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,515
The infectious equivalent
of a briefcase bomb.

67
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,984
So, yeah, I might call that
a little unusual.

68
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:14,352
Day and a half?

69
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,954
That's the same time
those statues started crying.

70
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:16,999
Yep.

71
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,156
I'm sorry, what was that?

72
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:19,691
What was <i>what?</i>

73
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,759
Did you just say a bunch
of statues started crying?

74
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,828
What? why, no.
No. W-who would...

75
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:25,230
Who would say that, huh?
Crazy people.

76
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:26,297
Exactly.

77
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:27,699
Yeah, which we are not.

78
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:29,334
No.

79
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:31,503
Just... get us some vaccine.

80
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:38,209
Whew.

81
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:44,482
Let me guess... another
steamin'-hot pile of swine flu.

82
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,583
Yep.

83
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:47,085
Doesn't make any sense, Bobby.

84
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,187
Pestilence touched down here.
I'm sure of it.

85
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:50,955
But why is he dealing them
soft serve like swine flu

86
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,590
when he's got the
croatoan virus up his sleeve?

87
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:53,992
I-I-I don't get it.

88
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,861
Doesn't matter what the sick
son of a bitch is doing.

89
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,897
What matters is, this is
the fourth town he's hit

90
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:01,166
that we know of...
and we're still eating his dust.

91
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,667
Did you get <i>anything?</i>

92
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,837
We got even a snowball
at probable next target?

93
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:07,672
Uh, no pattern we can see.

94
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,107
Okay.

95
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:10,942
Hold on.

96
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:19,184
Well, far as I can tell,
he's still heading east,

97
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:22,487
so... head east, I guess.

98
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,622
- East?
- East?

99
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,524
Bobby, we're in West Nevada...

100
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,326
east is practically all there is.

101
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,894
Yeah, well, you better get to drivin'.

102
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,033
Say...

103
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,568
<i>I've</i> got an idea.

104
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,106
Did you get him?

105
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:43,208
He's gone.

106
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,310
Fancy a fag and a chat?

107
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:51,182
You're upset.
We should discuss it.

108
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,517
Not <i>here,</i> but...

109
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,719
You want to talk?
After what you did to us?

110
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,354
After what I...
what <i>I</i> did to <i>you?!</i>

111
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:57,789
I gave you the colt!

112
00:04:57,856 --> 00:04:59,824
Yeah, and you knew it wouldn't
work against the devil!

113
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:01,793
- I never!
- You set us up.

114
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,362
We lost people
on that suicide run...

115
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,663
<i>good</i> people!

116
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:08,299
Who you take on the ride
is your own business!

117
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:11,803
Look, everything
is still the same.

118
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,605
W-we're all still in this together.

119
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:14,939
Sure we are.

120
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:18,208
Call your dog off, please.

121
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,412
Give me one good reason.

122
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,047
I can give you Pestilence.

123
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,049
What do you know
about Pestilence?

124
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,618
I know how to get him.

125
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:29,386
That's got your interest, doesn't it?

126
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:34,825
- Are you actually listening to this?
- Sam...

127
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,427
- Are you friggin' nuts?!
- Shut up for a second, Sam!

128
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:38,796
Shut up, the both of you!

129
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:40,898
Look... I swear...

130
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,668
I thought the colt would work.
It's an honest mistake.

131
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,870
It's all part
of the learning process.

132
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:49,707
But nothing's changed.
I still want the devil dead.

133
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:51,142
Well... <i>one</i> thing's changed.

134
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,977
Now the devil <i>knows</i>
<i>that I want him dead.</i>

135
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:54,345
Which, by the way,

136
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,281
makes me the most buggered son
in all of creation.

137
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:57,615
Holy crap... we don't care.

138
00:05:57,683 --> 00:06:00,218
They burnt down my house!

139
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,055
They ate my tailor!

140
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:09,427
Two months under a rock,
like a bloody salamander!

141
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:13,698
Every demon on hell and earth's
got his eyes out for me!

142
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:15,933
And yet... here I am...

143
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,303
last place I should be...

144
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,639
in the road, talking
to Sam and Dean Winchester,

145
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:23,741
under a friggin' spotlight!

146
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,887
So come with me.
Please.

147
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,194
Do you want the
Horsemen rings or not?

148
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,398
Yes, I know all about that.

149
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,799
Shall we?

150
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:05,650
Here we are...

151
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,052
my life on the lam.

152
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,221
How the mighty have fallen.

153
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,889
Single-pane glass,

154
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:13,925
used contraception
in the fireplace.

155
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:17,895
The water damage alone...

156
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:19,797
My heart's bleeding for you.

157
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:21,766
Now, how do you know
about the rings?

158
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,368
Well, now...

159
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:25,403
I've been keeping
a close eye on you lot.

160
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:27,405
We got hex bags.
We're hidden from demons.

161
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:28,806
All but one.

162
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,843
That night you
broke into my house...

163
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,177
our first date,

164
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,114
my valet hid a tracking
device in your car...

165
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,448
a magical coin

166
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:40,218
that easily trumps
your little bags o' bones.

167
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,053
It allows me
to hear things, too...

168
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:44,889
And, my, the things I've heard.

169
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,626
So you want to cram the devil
back in the box?

170
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,697
Cunning scheme.

171
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:53,831
I want in.

172
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,935
You said you could
get us Pestilence.

173
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:00,972
Well, now...

174
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,776
I don't know
where Pestilence <i>is...</i>

175
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,711
per se...

176
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,482
But I do know
the demon who <i>does.</i>

177
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,919
He's what you might call
the Horsemen's stable boy.

178
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:18,723
He handles their itineraries,
their personal needs.

179
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,826
He's who you want... believe me.

180
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:23,594
He'll tell us
where sneezy's at.

181
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:25,163
Well, how do we
get him to spill?

182
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,464
Rip out his toe-nails?

183
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:27,565
No.

184
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,834
Nuts at his pay grade
don't crack.

185
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:32,036
We bring him here,
then I sell him.

186
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:33,438
Sell him?

187
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:36,974
Please... I've sold sin
to saints for centuries.

188
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,610
Think I can't close
one little demon?

189
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,313
All right, so where's
this demon of yours?

190
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:46,918
I don't want to hear "weeks."

191
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,020
I want to hear, "days."

192
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:51,222
But the lab isn't even
finished testing yet.

193
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,757
You let <i>me</i>
<i>worry about the lab.</i>

194
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:54,692
But, sir, you're asking
for distribution

195
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,027
on an unprecedented scale.

196
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:57,829
Well, we have an
unprecedented outbreak.

197
00:08:57,896 --> 00:09:01,899
The nation... is
terrified of swine flu.

198
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:06,204
They want our vaccine.
They <i>need</i> our vaccine.

199
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,073
It's called "demand," people.
Now, supply!

200
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:10,941
We're doing our best.

201
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,710
Oh, you're doing your best?

202
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:14,045
You're doing your best?

203
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,547
Well, then do the best
of somebody better!

204
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,826
You wanted to see me?

205
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:31,295
Mitchell, yes.
Come on in.

206
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,398
Look, Mr. Brady,
I know how important this is,

207
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,400
and I-I'm sorry if I sounded...

208
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,602
No apologies.

209
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,305
Mitch, I need people like you.

210
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,607
Really?

211
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:43,908
Really.

212
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:48,045
In fact, there is a position
in communications

213
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:51,148
that I think you
would be perfect for.

214
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,550
Sounds great.

215
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:53,885
<i>Is</i> great.
So what do you say?

216
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:55,019
You ready to enter

217
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:56,888
the cut-throat world
of upper management?

218
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:58,988
Awesome.

219
00:09:58,999 --> 00:09:59,999
Awesome.

220
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:06,430
Ooh. Watch the shoes, please.

221
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,669
Get the rest later.
Thanks.

222
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:23,648
<i>Dis manibus</i>
<i>praeest praesens...</i>

223
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:27,885
<i>...Obtine mihi dominum</i>

224
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:31,255
<i>Pestilentiarum omnium.</i>

225
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,107
Sir, great news.

226
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:52,443
The vaccine trials...
the results have been...

227
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,745
...really quite grotesque.

228
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,314
I think you'll be pleased.

229
00:10:58,183 --> 00:10:59,917
How soon?

230
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:02,986
Distribution on this scale...
I mean, we do need <i>some</i> humans.

231
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,454
We can't possess them <i>all...</i>

232
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,290
and don't even get me started
on the teamsters. I...

233
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:10,661
I know.
I'm doing my best.

234
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:12,663
Yes, sir.

235
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:18,501
The best of someone
better. I will, of course.

236
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:29,203
Why are we even
listening to him, Dean?

237
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,238
This is totally insane.

238
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:31,539
I don't disagree.

239
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:35,877
One big happy family
are we, then? Fantastic.

240
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:37,745
You ready to go?

241
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:40,481
Yes. Yes. I am.

242
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,183
Sam, keep the home fires burning.

243
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:43,551
What are you talking about?

244
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,585
Sam's not coming.

245
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:45,820
And why the hell not?

246
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:48,189
Because I don't like you...

247
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:50,424
I don't trust you...

248
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,159
and oh, yes...

249
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,928
you keep trying to kill me.

250
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,597
There's no damn way.
This isn't gonna happen!

251
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:59,433
I'm not asking you, am I?
'cause you're not invited.

252
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,369
I'm asking <i>you.</i>
<i>What's it gonna be?</i>

253
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,944
Gentlemen...

254
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,880
enjoy your last few sunsets.

255
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,317
Wait.

256
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,592
I'll go.

257
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,304
What can I say?
I believe the guy.

258
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,994
And then Dean just walks...

259
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,033
right out the door
with Crowley.

260
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:09,303
Well, look, Sam,
I got no love for demons...

261
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,572
and, yeah,
this whole thing is crazy,

262
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,775
but... I don't know.

263
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,811
After a year
of chasing up zilch...

264
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,512
maybe it's <i>time</i>
<i>to go crazy.</i>

265
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,881
Yeah, maybe.

266
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,420
Hey, Bobby?

267
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:27,555
Yeah?

268
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:28,823
Uh...

269
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,524
remember that time
you were possessed?

270
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,626
Yeah. Rings a bell.

271
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:35,029
When Meg told you
to kill Dean, you didn't.

272
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,597
You took your body back.

273
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:39,500
Just long enough
to shank <i>myself,</i> yeah.

274
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,702
Well, how'd you do it?

275
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,738
I mean, how'd you
take back the wheel?

276
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:47,708
Why are you asking, Sam?

277
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:53,080
Say we can open the cage.

278
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:55,116
Great. But then what?

279
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,984
W-we just lead the
devil to the edge

280
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,352
and get him to jump in?

281
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,820
You got me.

282
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:01,756
What if <i>you</i> guys
lead the devil to the edge

283
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:03,457
and <i>I</i> jump in?

284
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:04,759
Sam.

285
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,127
It'd be just like

286
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:07,495
when you turned the knife
around on yourself.

287
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:09,163
One action... just one leap.

288
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,799
- Are you idjits trying to kill me?!
- Bobby...

289
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,068
We just got done talking
your brother off the ledge,

290
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,703
and now <i>you're</i> lining
up to say "yes"?

291
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,438
It's not like that.
I'm not gonna do it.

292
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:18,773
Not unless we all agree.

293
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,307
But I think we got to
look at our options.

294
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,009
This isn't an option, Sam.

295
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,010
Why not?

296
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,178
You can't do it.

297
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:26,414
What I did
was a million-to-one.

298
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:27,815
And that was some piss-ant demon

299
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,717
I was brain-wrestling.

300
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,985
You're talking about

301
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:33,120
taking back control
from Satan himself.

302
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:34,522
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

303
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:37,825
Kid...

304
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,828
it's called "possession"
for a reason.

305
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:44,098
You, of all people,
ought to know.

306
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,366
I'm strong enough.

307
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,034
You ain't.

308
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,737
He's gonna find every
chink in your armor, Sam,

309
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,372
and use it against you.

310
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,374
Your fear, your grief, your anger.

311
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,708
And let's face it...

312
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:57,111
you're not exactly
Mr. Anger management.

313
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:59,280
How are you
gonna control the devil

314
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:01,048
when you can't control <i>yourself?</i>

315
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,393
Demons?

316
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:14,595
Nah. Human shields.

317
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,399
The demons are up top...
12th floor.

318
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:19,767
All right, then.

319
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,902
We'll have to find a way in
through the back.

320
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,106
You Winchesters make
everything so complicated.

321
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:27,575
Ah, crap.

322
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,316
Oh, crap.

323
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,652
Crap! Crap!

324
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,524
Door's open!

325
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:56,470
What?

326
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:58,939
You killed them?

327
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:06,714
We're on a tight schedule.

328
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:08,015
Come on.

329
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:13,120
<i>Now</i> you're squeamish?
Please.

330
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,758
Go get 'em, tiger.

331
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:21,128
You're not coming?

332
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,564
Oh, no. It's not safe up there.
There's demons.

333
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,099
Yeah, I get that.

334
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,634
Look, just do what I told you,

335
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:28,936
a-and try to be convincing.

336
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,005
It'll work like a charm.
Trust me.

337
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:56,497
Dean Winchester.

338
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,065
What, no appointment?

339
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,139
Kind of an 11th-hour thing,
you know?

340
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:08,008
Well, then,
you're just on time.

341
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:11,512
Have a seat.

342
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:16,784
How's your brother?

343
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,962
Well, down to business then.

344
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:33,934
What can I do for you?

345
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,769
Actually, it's about
what I can do for <i>you.</i>

346
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:37,438
Really?

347
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:39,773
Me and Sam dropped
two of your jockeys.

348
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,175
I think you know that.

349
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,576
Yes.
I got the memo.

350
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,613
Well, we kept their, uh,
secret power rings.

351
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,747
Mm.

352
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,716
Which is why I'm here.

353
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:51,719
I heard some folks saying
that you wanted them back

354
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:53,420
And you were willing to pay.

355
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:54,855
Hmm.

356
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:57,791
Where are they?

357
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,059
Not here.

358
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:00,628
But you want them,
you'll come with me...

359
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:01,929
nice and civil...

360
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,731
we'll get out of
your little bat-cave here,

361
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:05,366
and we'll discuss
a transaction.

362
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:09,637
Who says I want them?

363
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:12,706
What?

364
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:16,110
Who... says...
I want them?

365
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:20,080
You know...

366
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:20,981
folks.

367
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,888
See...

368
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,923
...War and Famine,

369
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:33,661
even if I <i>could</i> cram the rings
back on their bony fingers,

370
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:36,297
I doubt it would do much good.

371
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:39,433
They're withered husks right now...

372
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,068
fetal position on the floor...

373
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:42,936
all thanks to <i>you.</i>

374
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,741
So I <i>don't</i> want the rings.

375
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,145
What I want is retribution.

376
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:54,848
And I'm gonna rip it
right out of your ass!

377
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,192
This...

378
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,462
is <i>so</i> good.

379
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:10,864
Therapeutic, for sure.

380
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:14,168
You know, Dean,
I really owe you one, buddy.

381
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:15,803
'Cause I feel...

382
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,638
so...

383
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,573
much...

384
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:20,974
better!

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,050
Dean!

386
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:36,512
Dean, now where are
you going? Come on,

387
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,715
we're just getting started!

388
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:22,125
Good meeting, Dean.

389
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:23,493
You know, I'm excited.

390
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,730
Evening, uncle.

391
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:41,778
What the hell was that?

392
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:42,979
<i>That</i> was perfect.

393
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,047
Perfect?

394
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,416
He didn't want the rings.
He wanted <i>me.</i>

395
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:49,952
Imagine the surprise
on your face.

396
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,254
What?

397
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:52,889
Your ignorance
and misinformation...

398
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:54,791
I mean, it's completely authentic.

399
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,192
You can't fake that.

400
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,561
What?
I-it went like clockwork.

401
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:00,596
Not for <i>me,</i>
<i>you son of a bitch!</i>

402
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:04,600
That's what you get...
working with a demon.

403
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:15,945
Hey, hot stuff,
watch the upholstery!

404
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:17,013
Up yours, mate.

405
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:21,851
This bit of carving
will tie our friend here down.

406
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,853
No zapping off,
no smoking out...

407
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:25,154
locked in the meat suit.

408
00:21:25,222 --> 00:21:27,456
An important piece
of our bargaining strategy.

409
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:32,428
Now, up here,
we don't want I-50.

410
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,063
Take 93 north.

411
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:35,598
What are you talking about?

412
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,934
Look, we can't take this guy
back to your brother.

413
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:39,969
Why the hell not?

414
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:45,408
Crowley!

415
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:46,976
They got history, all right?

416
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:56,786
You want to go anywhere,
you start talking.

417
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:57,920
What history?

418
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:26,115
Where's Dean?

419
00:22:28,518 --> 00:22:30,086
Now...

420
00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:33,456
for the record,
I'm against this.

421
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:35,424
Negotiating a high-level defection...

422
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:37,126
it's very delicate business.

423
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:43,266
What are you talking about?

424
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,901
I begged Dean not to come back.

425
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:47,270
We should be miles away...
from <i>you.</i>

426
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:49,739
He replied with
a colorful rejoinder

427
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:51,274
about my "corn chute."

428
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:56,579
So, go ahead.

429
00:22:56,647 --> 00:22:59,815
Go... ruin our last best hope.

430
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:07,223
It's only the end of the world.

431
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:19,035
Sam.

432
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:20,403
What's going on, Dean?

433
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,906
I need you to
stay on mission, okay?

434
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:25,141
Focused.

435
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,243
I don't understand.
What's all this about?

436
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:28,377
I'm doing this
'cause I trust you.

437
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:31,213
Trust me to what?

438
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:32,214
Sam?

439
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,051
Sam, is that you?

440
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:45,594
Brady?

441
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:51,467
Brady hasn't been,
Brady in years.

442
00:23:51,535 --> 00:23:55,504
Not since, oh...
middle of our sophomore year?

443
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:57,573
- What?
- That's right.

444
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:03,012
You had a devil on your
shoulder even back then.

445
00:24:06,516 --> 00:24:09,051
All right, now,
let it all sink in.

446
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,653
You son of a bitch.

447
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:13,122
You son of a bitch!
You introduced me to Jess!

448
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,857
Ding, ding!
I think he's got it!

449
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:16,359
- Damn it, Sam!
- I'm gonna kill you!

450
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:25,559
Hey, that's enough!

451
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:28,938
- Get out of my way!
- No.

452
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:31,073
Get out of my way, Dean.

453
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,408
There is only one way to win,

454
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:34,109
and it ain't by killing
that thing in there.

455
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:36,545
Well...

456
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:38,781
sounds like you got
him nice and fluffed.

457
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:41,817
Thanks so much.

458
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:43,786
Listen to me.

459
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:45,621
We need Pestilence
to get at the devil,

460
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:47,523
and we need, <i>Brady</i>
<i>to get to Pestilence.</i>

461
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:50,526
Why, because Crowley said so?

462
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:52,194
Because we trust him now?

463
00:24:52,262 --> 00:24:53,462
Like I trusted Ruby?

464
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,631
Or like I trusted Brady
back at school?

465
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:08,110
Look... do the math yourself.

466
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:10,112
If Lucifer wins...

467
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,648
he'll turn this place
into his kingdom.

468
00:25:12,716 --> 00:25:15,284
When the morning-star cleans house,

469
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:16,786
we all get the mop.

470
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:21,057
He created us...

471
00:25:21,124 --> 00:25:23,059
why would he destroy us?

472
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:25,194
That makes no sense.

473
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:27,763
Look at who...

474
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:30,299
at <i>what</i> he is.

475
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,501
Then take a look
at what <i>we</i> are.

476
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,204
Maybe you should be
a little less worried

477
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:37,173
about <i>our</i> necks

478
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,209
and be a little more worried
about <i>yours.</i>

479
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:43,112
Has crossed my mind.
That's not really the point.

480
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,415
Actually, Crowley...
<i>that</i> is the point.

481
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:50,586
No one will know
greater torment than you.

482
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:54,457
Lucifer is never
gonna let you die.

483
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:58,894
As for me, I know the score.

484
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:02,798
I'm dead, whether
I tell you anything or not.

485
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:06,702
So I think I'll die
on the winning side, thanks.

486
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:11,173
Good talk.

487
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,742
Cheers.

488
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,428
Well, how'd it go?
He buy your girl scout cookies?

489
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:33,963
Not yet.

490
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:37,199
Where's your moose?

491
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:39,868
He's cooling off.

492
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:43,005
All right, then.

493
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:44,039
Get bent.

494
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:46,075
You going somewhere?

495
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:47,609
Well, he won't budge.

496
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:49,545
So now I go stick my neck out.

497
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:53,615
What are you gonna do?

498
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:55,584
Exactly the kind
of desperate swash-buckle

499
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:56,919
I've been trying to avoid.

500
00:26:56,986 --> 00:27:00,923
Now I go kick open
a hive of demons.

501
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,165
This whole bloody
ring business better work.

502
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,862
Sam!

503
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:42,497
Come on, Sam. Come on!

504
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:43,997
Hey!

505
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,197
Open the door!

506
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,197
Open the door!

507
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:58,514
Well, here we go.

508
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,018
We doing last words or no?

509
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:05,921
Sophomore year, huh?

510
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,293
Brady, here,
he was a good kid...

511
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:12,461
straight arrow.

512
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,596
I mean, your
best friend, really.

513
00:28:14,664 --> 00:28:16,865
Perfect point of access.

514
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,534
Thanks-giving.

515
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,035
Yes, sir.

516
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:23,071
Remember when I came back
from break all messed up...

517
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,040
dropped out of pre-med,
the drugs, the bitches?

518
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:29,444
That was the new Brady.
That was <i>me.</i>

519
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:33,248
Remember how much
time you spent

520
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:35,317
trying to get me
back on the right track?

521
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:38,821
You really were a good friend.

522
00:28:41,124 --> 00:28:43,792
But ol' yellow eyes didn't send
me back to be your friend.

523
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,195
No, we could tell
we were starting to lose you.

524
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,729
You were becoming
a mild-mannered,

525
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:49,965
worthless sack of piss.

526
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:52,835
Now, come on.
We couldn't have that.

527
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:54,503
You were our favorite.

528
00:28:57,807 --> 00:28:59,007
So I hooked you up

529
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:04,179
with a pure, sweet,
innocent piece of tail.

530
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:06,615
And then I toasted her
on the ceiling.

531
00:29:09,853 --> 00:29:13,055
That's right... Azazel might
have put the hit out on Jessica...

532
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:15,557
but, man, <i>I</i> got to have
all the fun!

533
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,663
You know, <i>she</i> thought
we were friends, too.

534
00:29:21,731 --> 00:29:23,131
Let me right in.

535
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:25,834
She was baking cookies.

536
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:32,074
She was so surprised...

537
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:35,944
so hurt when I started in on her.

538
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:37,312
Come on!

539
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,281
Do it if it'll
make you feel better!

540
00:29:40,683 --> 00:29:43,752
Do it, Sammy! Do it!
Come on!

541
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,054
Come on.

542
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:55,697
Ohh.

543
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,108
Come on.

544
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,144
Hey, hey, hey!
All right! Wait!

545
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,179
I'm gonna open it.

546
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:18,016
- What happened?
- Nothing.

547
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:20,152
- My ass.
- Dean, I'm fine.

548
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:22,054
Yeah, and what about Brady?

549
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:24,923
Like you said...

550
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:27,659
we need him.

551
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,228
God... the day I've had.

552
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,401
Good news.

553
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,604
You're going to live forever.

554
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,942
What did you do?

555
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,180
Went over to a demons' nest...
had a little massacre.

556
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,716
Must be losing my touch, though...

557
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:53,085
let one of the little toads live.

558
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:55,020
Oops.

559
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:57,889
Also might have given said toad
the impression

560
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,192
that you left your
post last night

561
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,394
because you and I are...

562
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:04,629
wait for it...

563
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,232
lovers in league against Satan.

564
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,041
Hello, darling.

565
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:20,178
So, now death is off the table.

566
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:23,248
Now you get to be on the boss's
eternal-torment list

567
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:24,549
with little old me.

568
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,485
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No.

569
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,353
Something else
we have in common...

570
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:30,522
apart from our torrid
passion, of course...

571
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,057
craven self-preservation.

572
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:37,629
So, now, why don't you tell me
where Pestilence is at?

573
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,108
Oh, God, Crowley.

574
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,977
Was that a hell-hound?

575
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:54,613
I'd say yeah.

576
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,814
<i>Why</i> was that a hell-hound?

577
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:58,850
What's that?

578
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,986
Remember I was telling you about
my crafty little tracking device?

579
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,287
Yeah.

580
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,722
Demons planted one on <i>me.</i>

581
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,725
You're saying a hell-hound
followed you here?

582
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,260
Well, technically,
he followed <i>this.</i>

583
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,529
Get me out of here.
I'll tell you anything you want.

584
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,130
- Shut up.
- Okay, well, then we should go.

585
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:14,800
Sorry, boys. No one knows more
about the hounds than I.

586
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:16,802
You're long past
the point of "go."

587
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:23,341
- Damn it.
- I told you!

588
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,277
Oh, well, good for you.

589
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,112
Luckily, we have salt
in the kitchen.

590
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,548
I'll watch Brady.

591
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,950
Watch me?

592
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,953
Get me the hell out of here!

593
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,219
Sammy!

594
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:13,692
Salt?

595
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,262
Damn it,
get me out of here!

596
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,363
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

597
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,098
Great. Just great.

598
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,202
Hey!

599
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:27,172
You're back?

600
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,874
I'm invested...

601
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:29,941
currently.

602
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,343
Stay!

603
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,813
You can control them?

604
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:35,947
Not <i>that</i> one.

605
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:40,886
I brought my own.

606
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:43,522
Mine's bigger.

607
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,623
Sic him, boy!

608
00:33:57,589 --> 00:33:59,623
Go, go, go, go!

609
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,247
Go, go.

610
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:15,186
I'll wager you a 
$1,000, my pup wins.

611
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:33,972
Yeah. I'm sure
Pestilence will be there.

612
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,574
Thanks.

613
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,879
What do you think?

614
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:41,980
It's good.

615
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:46,618
You got no reason
to lie, have you?

616
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:50,155
Like I said before,
you're in <i>my</i> boat now.

617
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,958
You've screwed me... for eternity.

618
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,793
Nah.

619
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,561
Won't last that long.

620
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:58,196
Trust me.

621
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:01,399
Where are you going?

622
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,135
I'm <i>going</i>
<i>to do you a favor.</i>

623
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,441
I expect we'll be in touch.

624
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:34,432
What is this?

625
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,168
All those angels,
all those demons,

626
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,937
all those
sons of bitches...

627
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:40,572
they just don't get it,
do they, Sammy?

628
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,708
No. They don't, Dean.

629
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:45,844
You see, Brady...

630
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,379
<i>we're</i> the ones
you should be afraid of.

631
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,354
I bet this is a real moment
for you, big boy.

632
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:59,557
Gonna make you feel all better?

633
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,260
It's a start.

634
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:05,063
Gonna make up for all the times

635
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:07,198
that we yanked your chain...

636
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,501
Yellow eyes, Ruby, me?

637
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:12,804
But it wasn't <i>all</i> our fault,
was it? No, no, no, no.

638
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:14,439
<i>You're</i> the one
who trusted us.

639
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,441
You're the one
who let us into your life.

640
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:20,645
Let us whisper in your ear
over and over and over again.

641
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:22,914
Ever wonder why that is, Sammy?

642
00:36:22,982 --> 00:36:26,017
Ever wonder why we were
so in your blind spot?

643
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:31,322
Maybe it's because we got
the same stuff in our veins

644
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,694
And, deep down,
you know you're just like us.

645
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:39,798
Aaah!

646
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,274
Maybe you hate us so much,

647
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,775
because you hate what you see

648
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:52,310
every time you
look in the mirror.

649
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,713
You ever think of that?!

650
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,981
Maybe the only difference

651
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,085
between you and a demon...

652
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:02,554
is your hell is right here.

653
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:20,605
Interesting theory.

654
00:37:38,438 --> 00:37:40,005
Yeah, I followed up.

655
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:42,074
Nasty omens,

656
00:37:42,142 --> 00:37:44,910
but none of it's death
with a capital "D."

657
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:50,182
Well, just give me a ring
if it turns into anything.

658
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,017
And, Rufus...

659
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:54,820
you watch your ass out there.

660
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:58,724
Chin up.
Cavalry's arrived.

661
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:02,261
Charming.

662
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:04,096
That won't work on me.

663
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:05,431
Name's Crowley.

664
00:38:05,498 --> 00:38:07,700
Maybe you've...

665
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:09,168
<i>You're</i> Crowley?

666
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:11,737
In the flesh...
of a moderately successful

667
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:14,572
literary Agent out of New York.

668
00:38:15,108 --> 00:38:16,642
Aah!

669
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:22,314
I see you <i>have</i> heard of me.

670
00:38:23,683 --> 00:38:25,084
I liked this suit.

671
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:26,151
What are you doing here?

672
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:27,553
Looking out for Crowley.

673
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:28,287
Meaning...?

674
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:33,692
The boys are on
to ring number 3,

675
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,762
but we still need number 4.

676
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,564
I'm here to help.

677
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:43,769
You know where death is?

678
00:38:47,974 --> 00:38:49,475
No.
Haven't the foggiest.

679
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:54,880
Well, then get the hell
off my property

680
00:38:54,948 --> 00:38:57,216
before I blast you
so full of rock salt...

681
00:38:57,283 --> 00:38:58,751
you crap margaritas.

682
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:00,352
That's a mite unfriendly,

683
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,688
seeing as I could be
getting you death's location

684
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,757
in about the time
it'd take you to reload.

685
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:06,825
You're just gonna
chat some demons up

686
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:08,794
and hope they
don't recognize you?

687
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:10,729
God, no.
That could get me killed.

688
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:15,000
But there <i>is</i>
this little spell that I know.

689
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:16,468
That so?

690
00:39:16,536 --> 00:39:18,570
Results are 100% guaranteed.

691
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:21,073
Okay. Then why are you
snake-oiling me?

692
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:23,876
Well, it's a little bit...

693
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,380
embarrassing.

694
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:30,683
There's this... technicality.

695
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,384
Uh-huh.

696
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:35,320
I need a little something
to get the magic going.

697
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:36,989
And what's that?

698
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:39,191
You make a wish.

699
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:41,260
I can give you
anything you want, mate...

700
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:44,063
up to and including
death's coordinates.

701
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,297
All I need is...

702
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:47,166
My soul.

703
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:48,834
I've done more with less.

704
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:50,969
Let's just say when they're
getting their grammys,

705
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:53,404
They shouldn't all be
thanking God.

706
00:39:54,374 --> 00:39:57,242
It's worth it, Bobby.

707
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,243
Think.

708
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:04,149
Okay.

709
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,351
Here's my counter.

710
00:40:08,888 --> 00:40:09,655
Ow!

711
00:40:09,723 --> 00:40:11,924
Bloody hell!

712
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:13,092
Feisty.

713
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,227
Get out.

714
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:17,362
I'll give it right back.

715
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,665
You think I'm a natural-born idjit?

716
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,100
Quite the contrary.

717
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,869
Look, you're right
to be suspicious.

00:40:23,937 --> 00:40:25,270
But I'm your ally.

719
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:28,607
Enemy of my enemy and all that.

720
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:30,909
I need the devil
back in his stock.

721
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:34,713
In fact, my delicate ass
<i>depends</i> on it.

722
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:42,087
I promise you... temporary loan.

723
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:45,090
I'll give it... right... back.
