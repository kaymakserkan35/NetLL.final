1
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,580
Who are you?
Castiel.

2
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,580
<i>I mean what are you?
I'm an angel of the lord.</i>

3
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,710
Castiel:
the rising of the witnesses
is one of the 66 seals.

4
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,150
Those seals are being broken
by lilith.

5
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,150
Last one opens and...

6
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,080
Lucifer walks free.

7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,810
So,you been using
your,uh,freaky e.S.P. Stuff?
No.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,980
Yeah,well,let's keep it
that way.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,180
Sam: I'm just
exorcising demons.

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,310
Dean:
with your mind!

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,880
I can send them back
to hell.

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,210
But try to see
the other side here.
The other side?!

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,210
I'm pulling demons
out of innocent people.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,180
Use the knife!
The knife kills
the victim.

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,280
What I do,
most of them survive!

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,780
You should show me
some respect.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,650
I dragged you
out of hell.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,410
I can throw you back in.

19
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,950
Whew.

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,980
How was the store?

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,410
Oh,madness.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,550
Yeah?

23
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,880
Everyone in town
was stocking up.

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,580
Did,uh,you get enough?

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,750
I had to arm-Wrestle
norma bleaker for these.

26
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,080
Honey,she's 74.

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,750
And a lot stronger
than she looks.

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,080
Unh-Unh-Unh.

29
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,410
Remember last year?
We ran out at 6:30.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,850
It's just one piece.
Unh-Unh-Unh-Unh.

31
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,450
You can have as much
as you want...

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,780
After halloween.

33
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,610
No.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,980
Oh,who needs a bath?

35
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,780
Huh?

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,050
Huh?

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,310
Oh,there we go!

38
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,750
You coming?

39
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,110
I'll,uh,
I'll be up in a minute.

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,350
Okay.

41
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,650
Luke,what's taking you
so long?

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,280
Oh,my god.

43
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,050
Oh,my god!

44
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,280
Now,how many razor blades
did they find?

45
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,050
Two on the floor,
one in his stomach,

46
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,650
And one was stuck
in his throat.

47
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,080
He swallowed
four of them.

48
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,850
How is that even possible?

49
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,780
The candy was
never in the oven.

50
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,850
We just have to be thorough,
mrs. Wallace.

51
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,880
Did the police find any razors
in the rest of the candy?

52
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,680
No.

53
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,250
I mean,I don't know.
I don't think so.

54
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,950
I just...

55
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,980
I can't believe it.

56
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,350
You hear urban legends
about this stuff,

57
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,380
But it actually happens?

58
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,750
[ Sighs ]
more than you might imagine.

59
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,180
Mrs. Wallace,
did luke have any enemies?

60
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,680
Enemies?

61
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,810
Anyone who might have held
a grudge against him?

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,050
What do you mean?

63
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,950
Co-Workers.

64
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,180
Neighbors.

65
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,710
Maybe a woman.

66
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,450
Are you suggesting
an affair?

67
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,310
Is it possible?

68
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,650
No!

69
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,450
No,luke would nev--

70
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm very sorry.

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,210
We just have to consider
all possibilities.

72
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
If someone wanted to kill
my husband,

73
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,780
Don't you think
they'd find a better way

74
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,780
<i>Than a razor in a piece of candy
he might eat?</i>

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,080
[ Chuckles ]
really?

76
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,480
After that guy choked down
all those razor blades?

77
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,610
It's halloween,man.

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,210
Yeah.

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,610
For us,
every day is halloween.

80
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,010
Don't be a downer.

81
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,380
Anything interesting?

82
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,110
Well,we're on a witch-Hunt,
that's for sure.

83
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,010
But this isn't your typical
hex bag.

84
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,050
Hmm. No?

85
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,550
Goldthread -- An herb that's
been extinct for 200 years.

86
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,780
And this is celtic,

87
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,280
And I don't mean
some new age knock-Off.

88
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,250
Looks like the real deal --
Like 600-Years-Old real.

89
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,780
And,uh...

90
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,380
That is the charred metacarpal
bone of a newborn baby.

91
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,110
Oh,gross.

92
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,350
Relax,man.

93
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,750
It's,like,
at least 100 years old.

94
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,780
Oh,right,
like that makes it better?

95
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,380
Witches,man.
They're so freaking skeevy.

96
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,510
Yeah.

97
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,750
Well,it takes
a pretty powerful one

98
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,250
To put a bag like this
together.

99
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,110
More juice than we've ever dealt
with before,that's for sure.

100
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,180
What about you --
Find anything on the victim?

101
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,180
This luke wallace --
He was so vanilla

102
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,910
That he made vanilla
seem spicy.

103
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,850
I can't find any reason

104
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,680
Why somebody
would want this guy dead.

105
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,110
This party blows.

106
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,810
We should just go
t.P. Somebody.

Uh,hey,justin.

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,710
Yo.

into the booze yet?

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,080
Uh,it's triple-Locked.

111
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,310
So,you guys going to the
mausoleum party tomorrow night?

112
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,910
Are you gonna be there?

113
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,210
It's gonna be rad.

Well,it's got to be better
than this g-Rated assfest.

Oh,come on,

Oh,check it out.

Okay,bobbing for apples
is lame.

Oh,come on,

Uh...lame.

I would never.

You know,
it's just so weird.

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,580
I mean,the water in the tub --
It wasn't hot.

I don't know who that is.

147
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,280
I'm telling you,

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,110
Both of these vics
are squeaky-Clean.

149
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,550
There was no reason
for wicked-Bitch payback.

150
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,710
Maybe 'cause it's
not about that.

151
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,910
Wow. Insightful.

152
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,150
Maybe this witch
isn't working a grudge.

153
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,550
Maybe they're working
a spell.

154
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,780

"Three blood sacrifices
over three days --

157
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,950
Celtic calendar -- The final day
of the final harvest

158
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,480
Is october 31st.

159
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,680
Halloween?
Exactly.

160
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,650
What exactly are
the,uh,blood sacrifices for?

161
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,050
Uh,if I'm right,
this witch is summoning a demon.

162
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,080
And not just any demon --

163
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,750
Samhain.

164
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,680
Am I supposed to be
impressed?

165
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,210
Dean,samhain is the damn origin
of halloween.

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,580
The celts believed
that october 31st

167
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,010
Was the one night of the year

168
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,580
When the veil was thinnest
between the living and the dead.

169
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,850
And it was samhain's night.

170
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,680
I mean,masks were put on
to hide from him,

171
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,810
Sweets left on doorsteps
to appease him,

172
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,050
Faces carved into pumpkins
to worship him.

173
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,550
He was exorcised
centuries ago.

174
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,710
So even though samhain
took a trip downstairs,

175
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,810
The tradition stuck.

176
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,350
Exactly.

177
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,480
Only now,instead of demons
and blood orgies,

178
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,950
Halloween is all about kids,
candy,and costumes.

179
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,080
Okay,so some witch
wants to raise samhain

180
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,450
And take back the night?

181
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,380
Dean,this is serious.
I am serious.

182
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,350
We're talking
heavyweight witchcraft.

183
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,910
This ritual can only be
performed every 600 years.

184
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,910
And the 600-Year marker
rolls around...

185
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,910
Tomorrow night.
Naturally.

186
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,910
Well,it sure is
a lot of death and
destruction for one demon.

187
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,380
That's 'cause he likes
company.

188
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,910
Once he's raised,samhain can do
some raising of his own.

189
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,410
Raising what,exactly?

190
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,410
Dark,evil crap
and lots of it.

191
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,710
They follow him around like
the friggin' pied piper.

192
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,350
So we're talking ghosts.
Yeah.

193
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,450
Zombies?
Mm-Hmm.

194
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,850
Leprechauns?
Dean.

195
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,980
Those little dudes are scary.
Small hands.

196
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,310
Look,it just starts
with ghosts and ghouls.

197
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,650
This sucker keeps on going,

198
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,680
By night's end,we are talking
every awful thing

199
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,150
We've ever seen,

200
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,950
Everything we fight
all in one place.

201
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,080
It's gonna be
a slaughterhouse.

202
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,680
Hey.

203
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,680
How's it going?

204
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,950
Awesome.

205
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,880
Yeah,I talked with
mrs. Razor blade again.

206
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,850
I've been sitting out in front
of her house for hours,

207
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,180
And I've got a big,steamy
pile of nothing.

208
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,910
Look,Dean,someone planted
those hex bags,

209
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,350
Someone with access
to both houses.

210
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,750
There's got to be
some connection.

211
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,180
Yeah,well,
I hope we find him soon

212
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,650
'Cause I'm starting to cramp
like a -- Son of a bitch.

213
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,910
Quit whining.

214
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,080
No,Sam,
I mean "son of a bitch."

215
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,650
So?

216
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,080
Our apple-Bobbing
cheerleader?

217
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,650
Tracy?
Mm-Hmm.

218
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,050
The wallaces' babysitter.

219
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,350
She told me she'd never even
heard of luke wallace.

220
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,750
Huh.

221
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,850
Interesting look
for a centuries-Old witch.

222
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,880
Yeah,well,if you were
a 600-Year-Old hag

223
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,180
And you could pick
any costume to come back in,

224
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,850
Wouldn't you go
for a hot cheerleader?

225
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,280
I would.

226
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,510
Mmm.

227
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,210
Well,tracy's not as wholesome
as she looks.

228
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,680
Did some digging.

229
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,080
Apparently,she got into
a violent altercation

230
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,410
With one of her teachers.

231
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,850
Got suspended from school.

232
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,450
Bring back memories?

233
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,210
What do you mean?

234
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,110
Being a teenager,
all that angst.

235
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,410
Oh.

236
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,650
What'd you think I meant?

237
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,080
Nothing.
[ Chuckles ]

238
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,680
<i>Now,that
brings back memories.</i>

239
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,750
Dude,I need
a bigger kiln.

240
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,380
You gentlemen
wanted to talk to me?

241
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,710
Ah,mr. Harding.

242
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,110
Oh,please. Don.

243
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,280
Okay,don.

244
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,310
Even my students
call me don.

245
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,810
Yeah,we get it,don.

246
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,250
Uh,I'm agent geddy.
This is agent lee.

247
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,450
We just had a few questions
about,uh,tracy davis.

248
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,180
Uh,yeah,tracy.

249
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,180
Uh,bright kid,
loads of talent.

250
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,580
It's a shame
she got suspended.

251
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,650
You two had a,uh,
violent altercation.

252
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,010
Yeah,she exploded.

253
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,910
Uh,if principal murrow
hadn't walked by when he did,

254
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,450
Tracy would have
clawed my eyes out.

255
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,880
Why?

256
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,650
You know,I was only trying to
rap with her about her work.

257
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,480
It had gotten inappropriate
and disturbing.

258
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,480
More disturbing than --

259
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,280
Than,uh,those guys?

260
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,850
She would cover
page after page

261
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,110
With these bizarre
cryptic symbols.

262
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,510
And then there were
the drawings --

263
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,510
Detailed images of killings,
gory,primitive.

264
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,810
She would depict herself
in the middle of them,

265
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Participating.

266
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,450
Symbols?
What kind of symbols?

267
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,050
Uh,anything like this?

268
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,450
Yeah. Yeah,I think that
might have been one of them.

269
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,180
You know where
tracy is now?

270
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,510
I would imagine
her apartment.

271
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,050
<i>Her apartment?
Yeah.</i>

272
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,250
She got here
about a year ago alone,

273
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,910
As I understood it,
as an emancipated teen.

274
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,110
God only knows
what her parents were like.

275
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,010
So?

276
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,710
Tracy was nowhere
I could find.

277
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,650
Any luck with her friends?

278
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,880
Luck is not our style.

279
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,210
Friends don't know
where she is.

280
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,580
It's like the bitch
hopped a broom.

281
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,350
She could be making
the third sacrifice any time.

282
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,950
Yes,thank you,Sam.

283
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,050
Trick or treat.

284
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,450
This is a motel.

285
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,610
So?

286
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,750
So we don't have
any candy.

287
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,650
No,we have a ton
in the,uh --

288
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,610
We did,but it's gone.

289
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,350
Sorry,kid,
we can't help you.

290
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,050
I want candy.

291
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,650
Well,I think
you've had enough.

292
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,650
Who are you?!

293
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,510
Sam,Sam,wait!

294
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,410
It's castiel...

295
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,750
The angel.

296
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,480
Him,I don't know.

297
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,480
Hello,Sam.

298
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,010
Oh,my god.

299
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,650
Er,uh,I didn't mean to --
Sorry.

300
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,780
It's an honor.

301
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,050
Really,I-I've heard
a lot about you.

302
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,080
And I,you.

303
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,710
Sam Winchester --
The boy with the demon blood.

304
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,880
Glad to hear you've ceased
your extracurricular activities.

305
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,750
Let's keep it that way.

306
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,550
Yeah,okay,chuckles.

307
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,910
Who's your friend?

308
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,850
This raising of samhain --
Have you stopped it?

309
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,110
Why?
Dean,have you
located the witch?

310
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,910
Yes,we've located
the witch.

311
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,350
And is the witch dead?

312
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,180
No,but --
We know who it is.

313
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,910
Apparently,the witch
knows who you are,too.

314
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,050
This was inside
the wall of your room.

315
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,610
If we hadn't found it,

316
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,350
Surely one or both of you
would be dead.

317
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,850
Do you know
where the witch is now?

318
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,880
We're working on it.

319
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,980
That's unfortunate.

320
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,650
What do you care?

321
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,950
The raising of samhain
is one of the 66 seals.

322
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,110
So this is about
your buddy lucifer.

323
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,080
Lucifer is no friend
of ours.

324
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,350
It's just
an expression.

325
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,750
Lucifer cannot rise.

326
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,510
The breaking of the seal
must be prevented at all costs.

327
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,210
Okay. Great.

328
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,510
Well,now that you're
here,why don't you tell
us where the witch is?

329
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,180
We'll gank her,
and everybody goes home.

330
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,750
We are not omniscient.
This witch is very powerful.

331
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,710
She's cloaked,
even to our methods.

332
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,910
Okay,well,
we already know who she is.

333
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,880
So,if we work together --
Enough of this.

334
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,280
Who are you,
and why should I care?

335
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,250
This is uriel.

336
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,880
He's what you might call...

337
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,250
A specialist.

338
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,110
What kind of
a specialist?

339
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,410
What are you gonna do?

340
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,050
You -- Both of you,you need to
leave this town immediately.

341
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,510
Why?

342
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,210
Because we're about
to destroy it.

343
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,280
We're out of time.

344
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,610
This witch has to die.
The seal must be saved.

345
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,110
There are
a thousand people here.

346
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,080
1,214.

347
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,580
And you're willing
to kill them all?

348
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,610
This isn't
the first time I've...

349
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,280
Purified a city.

350
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,880
Look,I understand
this is regrettable.

351
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,280
Regrettable?

352
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,610
We have to hold the line.

353
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,950
Too many seals
have broken already.

354
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,650
So you screwed the pooch
on some seals,

355
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,310
And now this town
has to pay the price?

356
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,580
It's the lives of 1,000
against the lives of 6 billion.

357
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,110
There's a bigger picture here.

358
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,410
Right...

359
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,010
'Cause,uh,you're
bigger-Picture kind of guys.

360
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,550
Lucifer cannot rise.

361
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,510
He does,
and hell rises with him.

362
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,380
Is that something
that you're willing to risk?

363
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,080
We'll stop this witch
before she summons anyone.

364
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,950
Your seal won't be broken,
and no one has to die.

365
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,610
We're wasting time
with these mud monkeys.

366
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,880
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,350
But we have our orders.

368
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,350
No,you can't do this.
You -- You're angels.

369
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,780
I mean,
aren't you supposed to --

370
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,610
You're supposed to show mercy.

371
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,850
Says who?

372
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,610
We have no choice.

373
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,150
Of course
you have a choice.

374
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,610
I mean,come on,what,
you've never --

375
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,980
Never questioned
a crap order,huh?

376
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,680
What are you both,
just a couple of hammers?

377
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,950
Look,even if you can't
understand it,

378
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,380
Have faith
the plan is just.

379
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,750
How can you even
say that?

380
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,880
Because it comes from heaven.
That makes it just.

381
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,010
It must be nice
to be so sure of yourselves.

382
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,110
Tell me something,Dean.

383
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,780
When your father
gave you an order,

384
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,950
Didn't you obey?

385
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,750
Sorry,boys,it looks like
the plans have changed.

386
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,350
You think you can stop us?

387
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,780
No.

388
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,880
But if you're gonna smite
this whole town...

389
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,280
Then you're gonna have to
smite us with it

390
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,910
Because we are not leaving.

391
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,910
You went to the trouble
of busting me out of hell.

392
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,410
I figure I'm worth something
to the man upstairs.

393
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,450
You want to waste me?

394
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,710
Go ahead.

395
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,280
See how he digs that.

396
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,780
I will drag you out of here
myself.

397
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,210
Yeah,but you'll have
to kill me.

398
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,080
Then we're back
to the same problem.

399
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,450
I mean,come on.

400
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,650
You're gonna wipe out a whole
town for one little witch?

401
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,480
Sounds to me like you're
compensating for something.

402
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,110
We can do this.

403
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,980
We will find that witch.

404
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,650
We will stop the summoning.

405
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,050
Castiel,
I will not let these --

406
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,150
Enough.

407
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,150
I suggest
you move quickly.

408
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,550
Astronaut!

409
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,280
What?

410
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,350
Nothing.

411
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,110
I thought
they'd be different.

412
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,950
Who,the angels?

413
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,980
Yeah.

414
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,910
Well,I tried to tell you.

415
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,710
I just --

416
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,850
I mean,I thought
they'd be righteous.

417
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,680
<i>Well,
they are righteous.</i>

418
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,850
I mean,
that's kind of the problem.

419
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,410
Of course,there's nothing
more dangerous than some a-Hole

420
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,910
Who thinks he's on
a holy mission.

421
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,850
But,I mean,
this is god and heaven?

422
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,980
This is what
I've been praying to?

423
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,680
Look,man,I know you're into
the whole god thing

424
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,110
And jesus on a tortilla
and stuff like that.

425
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,350
But just because
there's a couple of bad apples

426
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,180
Doesn't mean the whole barrel
is rotten.

427
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,310
I mean,
for all we know,

428
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,610
God hates these jerks.

429
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,980
Don't give up on the stuff
is all I'm saying.

430
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,380
Babe ruth was a dick,

431
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,550
But baseball's
still a beautiful game.

432
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,080
Well,are you gonna figure out
a way to find this witch,

433
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,780
Or are you just gonna sit there
fingering your bone?

434
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,410
You know how much heat
it would take

435
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,610
To char
a bone like this,Dean?

436
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,610
No.

437
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,850
A lot.

438
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,250
I mean,more than a fire
or some kitchen oven.

439
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,380
Okay,betty crocker,
what does that mean?

440
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,380
It means we make a stop.

441
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,780
So,tracy used a kiln
to char the bone?

442
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,450
What's the big deal?

443
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,510
Dean,that hex bag
turned up in our room

444
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,080
Not after we talked
to tracy...

445
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,510
After we talked
to the teacher.

446
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,310
Hey.

447
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,480
Oh,my god.

448
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,080
Those are all
from children.

449
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,780
I'm guessing he's not
saving them for the dog.

450
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,110
The decision's
been made.

451
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,380
By a mud monkey.

452
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,510
You shouldn't
call them that.

453
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,410
Oh,
that's what they are --

454
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,910
Savages,
just plumbing on two legs.

455
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,350
You're close to blasphemy.

456
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,810
There's a reason
we were sent to save him.

457
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,210
He has potential.
He may succeed here.

458
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,450
At any rate...

459
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,710
It's out of our hands.

460
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,480
It doesn't have to be.

461
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,910
And what would you suggest?

462
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,350
That we drag Dean Winchester
out of here,

463
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,650
Then we blow this insignificant
pinprick off the map.

464
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,280
You know our true orders.

465
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,510
Are you prepared to disobey?

466
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,250
Thank you.
He was gonna kill me.

467
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,450
Ugh,that sick
son of a bitch.

468
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,750
I mean,
did you see what he was doing?

469
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,610
Did you hear him...

470
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,710
How sloppy
his incantation was?

471
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,210
My brother
always was a little dim.

472
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,980
He was gonna make me
the final sacrifice.

473
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,450
His idea.

474
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,650
But now,
that honor goes to him.

475
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,310
Our master has returned.

476
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,650
This spellwork's
a two-Man job,you understand?

477
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,580
So for 600 years,

478
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,480
I had to deal with that pompous
son of a bitch.

479
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,650
Planning,preparing --
Unbearable.

480
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,880
The whole time,
I wanted to rip his face off.

481
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,750
And...

482
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,810
...you get him with a gun.

483
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,810
Oh,I love that.

484
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,910
You know,back in the day,

485
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,950
This was the one night
you kept your children inside.

486
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,350
Well,tonight,you'll all see
what halloween really is.

487
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,650
What -- What are you doing?

488
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,210
Just follow my lead.

489
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,950
My love.

490
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,910
You've aged.

491
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,610
This face...

492
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,510
I can't fool you.

493
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,610
Your beauty is beyond time.

494
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,910
Whore.

495
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,780
What the hell was that?

496
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,250
Halloween lore.

497
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,710
People used to wear masks
to hide from him,

498
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,910
So I gave it a shot.

499
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,110
You gave it a shot?

500
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,160
How are we gonna find
this mook?

501
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,400
Where would you go
to raise all the dark
forces of the night?

502
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,530
A cemetery.

503
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,460
Yeah.

504
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,700
So,this demon's
pretty powerful.

505
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
Yeah.

506
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,700
It might take more
than the usual weapons.

507
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,600
Sam,no.

508
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,330
You're not using
your psychic whatever.

509
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,700
But --
Don't even think about it.

510
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,360
Ruby's knife is enough.
Why?

511
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,860
Because the angel said so,
for one.

512
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,660
I thought you said they were
a bunch of fanatics.

513
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,660
Well,they happen to be right
about this.
I don't know,Dean.

514
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,130
It doesn't seem like
they're right about much.

515
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,330
Look,
forget the angels,okay?

516
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,660
You said yourself,
these powers --

517
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,330
It's like playing with fire.

518
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,660
Please.

519
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,030
Dude,
I'm tripping balls.

520
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Yo,shh.
Be quiet. It's the cops.

521
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,100
Mr. Harding?

522
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,260
I mean...don?

523
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,160
Uh,don,you,uh --
You locked us in.

524
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,800
Help them.
Dude,you're not
going off alone.

525
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,060
Do it.

526
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,560
Stand back!
Stand back!

527
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,600
Come on,come on,come on!

528
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,560
Move!

529
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,760
Bring it on,stinky.

530
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,500
Yeah.

531
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,800
That demon-ray-gun stuff...

532
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,000
Doesn't work on me.

533
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,000
Zombie-ghost orgy,huh?

534
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,730
Well,that's it.

535
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,560
I'm torching everybody.

536
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,000
Tomorrow is november 2nd.

537
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,930
That's an anniversary
for you,right?

538
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,730
What are you doing here?

539
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,200
It's the day azazel
killed your mother

540
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,000
And,22 years later,
your girlfriend,too.

541
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,530
It must be difficult
to bear,

542
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,300
Yet you brazenly
use the power he gave you,

543
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,830
His profane blood
pumping through your veins.

544
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,130
Excuse me?

545
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,130
You were told
not to use your abilities.

546
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,860
What was I supposed to do?

547
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,460
That demon
would have killed me

548
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,630
And my brother
and everyone.

549
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,230
You were told not to.

550
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,560
If samhain had gotten loose
in this town --

551
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,330
Been warned twice now.

552
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,330
You know,my brother
was right about you.

553
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,300
<i>You are dicks.</i>

554
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,460
The only reason you're
still alive,Sam Winchester,

555
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,330
Is because
you've been useful.

556
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,360
The moment
that ceases to be true,

557
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,730
The second you become
more trouble then you're worth,

558
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,300
One word -- One --

559
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,500
And I will turn you
to dust.

560
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,930
As for your brother,

561
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,730
Tell him that maybe
he should climb off

562
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
That high horse of his.

563
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,100
Ask Dean...

564
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,100
What he remembers from hell.

565
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,300
Let me guess.

566
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,560
You're here
for the "I told you so."

567
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,300
No.

568
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,760
Well,good,'cause I'm really
not that interested.

569
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,260
I am not here
to judge you,Dean.

570
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,760
Then why are you here?

571
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,630
Our orders --

572
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,730
Yeah,you know,I've
had about enough of
these orders of yours.

573
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,630
Our orders...

574
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,760
Were not to stop
the summoning of samhain.

575
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,700
They were to do whatever
you told us to do.

576
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,430
Your orders
were to follow my orders?

577
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,630
It was a test...

578
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,000
To see how you would
perform under...

579
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,660
Battlefield conditions,
you might say.

580
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,760
It was a witch...

581
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,360
Not the tet offensive.

582
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,230
So,I,uh,
failed your test,huh?

583
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,460
I get it.

584
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,100
But you know what?

585
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,200
If you were to waive that --

586
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,660
That magic time-Traveling wand
of yours

587
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,460
And we had to do it
all over again,

588
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,560
I'd make the same call...

589
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,400
...'cause,see,
I don't know what's gonna happen

590
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,800
When these seals are broken.

591
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,760
Hell,I don't know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

592
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,630
But what I do know is
is that this here --

593
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,200
These kids,the swings,
the trees,all of it --

594
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,260
Is still here
because of my brother and me.

595
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,430
You misunderstand me,Dean.

596
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,200
I'm not like you think.

597
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,460
I was praying that you would
choose to save the town.

598
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,000
You were?

599
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,130
These people --

600
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,000
They're all
my father's creations.

601
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,330
They're works of art.

602
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,230
And yet...

603
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,730
Even though
you stopped samhain,

604
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,730
The seal was broken,

605
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,100
And we are one step closer to
hell on earth for all creation.

606
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,900
And that's
not an expression,Dean.

607
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,160
It's literal.

608
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,760
You of all people should...

609
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,630
Appreciate what that means.

610
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,860
I'll tell you something

611
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,960
If you promise
not to tell another soul.

612
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,900
Okay.

613
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm not,uh...

614
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,600
A hammer,as you say.

615
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,430
I have questions.

616
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,330
I...

617
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,360
I have doubts.

618
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:09,900
I don't know what is right
and what is wrong anymore...

619
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,700
And whether you passed
or failed here.

620
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,860
But in the coming months,

621
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,730
You will he more decisions
to make.

622
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,130
I don't envy the weight
that's on your shoulders,Dean.

623
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,660
I truly don't.
