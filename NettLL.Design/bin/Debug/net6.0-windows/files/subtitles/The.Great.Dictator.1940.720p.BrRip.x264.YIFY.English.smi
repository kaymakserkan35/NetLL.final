- This belt is too tight.
- Well, loosen it.

157
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:46,795
I'm trying to.

158
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,423
- [Engine Sputtering]
- We're upside down.

159
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,425

Oh. There it goes.

162
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:57,514
We're out of gas.

163
00:12:57,598 --> 00:13:00,600
Well, I suppose this is the end.

- Not now.

165
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:04,604
Then I shan't need this anymore.

What month is it?

167
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:07,690
April.

00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:10,026
Spring in Tomainia.

169
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:13,613
Hilda will be in the garden now
tending the daffodils.

170
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:16,282
How she loves daffodils.

171
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:19,494
She would never cut them
for fear of hurting them.

172
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:23,206
It was like taking a life
to cut a daffodil.

173
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,251
Sweet, gentle Hilda.

174
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,008
A beautiful soul.

175
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:36,177
And she loved animals.

- What do you say we take a shave together?
- I should be delighted.

- Makes a good a-barbershop.

You see, when I get shaved, I'm very nervous.
I like something to look at.

1398
01:38:35,898 --> 01:38:37,899
So I'm putting in glass walls and ceiling...

1399
01:38:37,983 --> 01:38:40,818
so that when my head is turned this way,
I shall have a view of the mountains.

I shall have a view through the glass ceiling.

- The ballroom.

You can't. They're all dead.

I have been in continued communication

"Victory shall come to the worthy."

1706
01:57:22,190 --> 01:57:27,402
Today, democracy, liberty and equality
are words to fool the people.

1707
01:57:27,487 --> 01:57:30,197
No nation can progress
with such ideas.

1708
01:57:30,281 --> 01:57:31,865
They stand in the way of action.

1709
01:57:31,949 --> 01:57:33,867
Therefore, we frankly abolish them.

1710
01:57:34,869 --> 01:57:39,539
In the future, each man will serve the interest
of the state with absolute obedience.

1711
01:57:39,624 --> 01:57:41,666
Let him who refuses beware.

1712
01:57:41,751 --> 01:57:46,129
The rights of citizenship will be taken away
from all Jews and other non-Aryans.

1713
01:57:46,214 --> 01:57:49,549
They are inferior,
and therefore enemies of the state.

1714
01:57:49,634 --> 01:57:53,053
It is the duty of all true Aryans
to hate and despise them.

1715
01:57:54,263 --> 01:57:57,307
Henceforth, this nation is annexed
to the Tomainian Empire...

1716
01:57:57,392 --> 01:58:01,186
and the people of this nation will obey
the laws bestowed upon us by our great leader...

the future emperor of the world.

1719
01:58:11,739 --> 01:58:13,448
You must speak.

1720
01:58:14,450 --> 01:58:15,909
I can't.

1721
01:58:15,993 --> 01:58:18,578
You must. It's our only hope.

1722
01:58:21,374 --> 01:58:22,707
Hope.

1723
01:59:10,548 --> 01:59:12,132
I'm sorry...

1724
01:59:12,216 --> 01:59:14,134
but I don't want to be an emperor.

1725
01:59:14,218 --> 01:59:16,303
That's not my business.

1726
01:59:16,387 --> 01:59:18,889
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

1727
01:59:18,973 --> 01:59:20,891
I should like to help everyone,
if possible -

1728
01:59:20,975 --> 01:59:24,227
Jew, gentile, black man, white.

1729
01:59:24,312 --> 01:59:27,898
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

1730
01:59:27,982 --> 01:59:31,234
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

1731
01:59:31,319 --> 01:59:33,737
We don't want to hate and despise
one another.

In this world, there's room for everyone,
and the good earth is rich...

01:59:37,074 --> 01:59:38,992
and can provide for everyone.

1734
01:59:39,076 --> 01:59:42,120
The way of life can be free and beautiful.

1735
01:59:42,205 --> 01:59:44,247
But we have lost the way.

1736
01:59:44,332 --> 01:59:46,875
Greed has poisoned men's souls...

1737
01:59:46,959 --> 01:59:49,252
has barricaded the world with hate...

1738
01:59:49,337 --> 01:59:52,255
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

1739
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:55,717
We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in.

1740
01:59:55,801 --> 01:59:58,845
Machinery that gives abundance
has left us in want.

1741
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:02,849
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.

1742
02:00:02,934 --> 02:00:05,769
We think too much and feel too little.

1743
02:00:05,853 --> 02:00:08,438
More than machinery,
we need humanity.

1744
02:00:08,523 --> 02:00:12,108
More than cleverness,
we need kindness and gentleness.

1745
02:00:12,193 --> 02:00:16,446
Without these qualities, life will be violent,
and all will be lost.

1746
02:00:16,531 --> 02:00:19,241
The aeroplane and the radio
have brought us closer together.

1747
02:00:19,325 --> 02:00:22,536
These very nature of these inventions
cries out for the goodness in men...

1748
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:26,039
cries out for universal brotherhood,
for the unity of us all.

1749
02:00:26,123 --> 02:00:29,125
Even now, my voice is reaching
millions throughout the world...

1750
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:32,420
millions of despairing men,
women and little children...

1751
02:00:32,505 --> 02:00:37,509
victims of a system that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people.

1752
02:00:37,593 --> 02:00:40,971
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.

1753
02:00:41,055 --> 02:00:44,224
The misery that is now upon us
is but the passing of greed...

1754
02:00:44,308 --> 02:00:48,061
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.

1755
02:00:48,145 --> 02:00:51,439
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die...

1756
02:00:51,524 --> 02:00:55,068
and the power they took from the people
will return to the people.

1757
02:00:55,152 --> 02:00:58,947
And so long as men die,
liberty will never perish.

1758

don't give yourselves to brutes...

who regiment your lives...

what to think and what to feel...

use you as cannon fodder!

to these unnatural men -

and machine hearts!

You are not machines!
You are not cattle! You are men!

fight for liberty!

02:01:34,108 --> 02:01:36,151
In the 17th chapter of Saint Luke
it is written...

1770
02:01:36,235 --> 02:01:37,861
"The kingdom of God is within man."

1771
02:01:37,945 --> 02:01:41,531
Not one man nor a group of men,
but in all men - in you!

1772

the power to create machines,
the power to create happiness!

to make this life free and beautiful...

that will give youth a future
and old age a security.

1781
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:09,100
By the promise of these things,
brutes have risen to power.

1782
02:02:09,185 --> 02:02:13,063
But they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.
They never will!

but they enslave the people.
