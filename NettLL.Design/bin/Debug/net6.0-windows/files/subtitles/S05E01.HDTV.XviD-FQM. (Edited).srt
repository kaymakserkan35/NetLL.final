1
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:13,263
No, No, No, No.

2
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:15,832
Lilith is trying
to break the 66 seals

3
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:17,067
To free, Lucifer from hell.

4
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:19,302
Lucifer will bring
the apocalypse.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,974
#I was caught in the middle
of a railroad track#

6
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:26,642
#Thunder#

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,015
#I looked 'round, and I knew
there was no turnin' back#

8
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,616
#Thunder#

9
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:40,123
#My mind raced, and I thought,
"what could I do?"#

10
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:41,724
You're possessing
some poor bastard?

11
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,461
This is... a vessel.

12
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:46,929
I had to give my consent
to invite him in.

13
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:49,932
#You've been thunderstruck#

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,738
#I was shakin' at the knees#

15
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,874
Chuck Shurley?

16
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:00,276
We have a life. You've been
using it to write your books.

17
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:02,612
Dean, let him go.
This man is to be protected.

18
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,547
- Why?
- He's a prophet of the lord.

19
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:07,217
- Who are you?
- I'm Zachariah. I'm, Castiel's superior.

20
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:08,885
- And how am I gonna ice Lilith?
- You're not.

21
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:10,286
Lilith's going to break
the final seal.

22
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:11,587
You don't want to stop it,
do you?

23
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,990
You are chosen.
You will stop it.

24
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,926
Just... not Lilith
or the apocalypse, that's all.

25
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,498
#Thunderstruck#

26
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,199
#Ah ah ah ah ah#

27
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,668
#Thunderstruck#

28
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,937
#You've been thunderstruck#

29
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:28,938
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,081
- Sammy, let's go.
- Dean...

31
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:42,519
He's coming.

32
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:46,289
Come on.

33
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:47,457
Dean!

34
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,727
What the devil
is your name?

35
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,796
Sa... s-s...
Uh... s... s...

36
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:29,432
yo-Sam-ity, Sam!

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
Yo-Sam-ity, Sam?

38
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,868
Hmm, let's see.

39
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:33,869
Sam...

40
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,306
Ah, here it is.

41
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,110
What the hell?

42
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:42,044
I don't know.

43
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:45,881
Folks, quick word
from the flight deck.

44
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,818
We're just passing over
Ilchester, then Ellicott city,

45
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,820
on our initial descent
into Baltimore...

46
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,755
Ilchester? Weren't we just there?

47
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,424
So if you'd like
to stretch your legs...

48
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:55,725
now would be a good time to.

49
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,127
Holy crap!

50
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,130
Aaaah!

51
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,625
And governor, O'malley urged calm,

52
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:31,493
saying it's very unlikely
an abandoned convent

53
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,495
would be a target
for terrorists,

54
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:35,698
- either foreign or homegrown.
- Change the station.

55
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,166
Hurricane Kinley,

56
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,101
unexpectedly slamming into
the Galveston area...

57
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,269
...announced a successful test

58
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:42,371
of the, North Korean nuclear...

59
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:43,973
- ...baffled...
- ...swine flu...

60
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:52,982
Dean look...

61
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,250
Don't. Don't say anything.

62
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:58,120
It's okay.

63
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,390
We just got to
keep our heads down

64
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:02,892
And hash this out. All right?

65
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,697
Yeah, okay.

66
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:09,031
All right, well, first things first.

67
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,933
How did we end up
on "soul plane"?

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,935
Angels, maybe?

69
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,504
I mean, you know,
beaming us out of harm's way?

70
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:18,340
Well, whatever.
It's the least of our worries.

71
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:19,641
We need to find, Cass.

72
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,719
Oh!

73
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:05,154
Geez! Ow!

74
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,622
Sam.

75
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,457
- Yeah!
- Hey, Chuck.

76
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,292
So... you're okay?

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,461
Well, my head hurts.

78
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,797
No, I mean... I mean,
my... My last vision.

79
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,766
You went, like,
full-On, Vader.

80
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,401
Your body temperature was 150.
Your heart rate was 200.

81
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:20,770
Your eyes were black.

82
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,037
Your eyes went black?

83
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,340
I didn't know.

84
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:29,044
Where's, Cass?

85
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,647
He's dead.

86
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,548
Or gone.

87
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:36,418
The, archangel smote the crap out of him.

88
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,853
- I'm sorry.
- You're sure?

89
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,989
I mean, maybe he just vanished
into the light or something.

90
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:42,724
Oh, no. He, like, exploded.

91
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:45,194
Like a water balloon
of, chunky soup.

92
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,532
You got a...

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,835
Uh... right here?

94
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:53,869
Uh, the...

95
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,504
Oh.

96
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:57,940
Oh, god.

97
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:02,878
Is that a molar?

98
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,682
Do I have a molar in my hair?

99
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,853
This has been
a really stressful day.

100
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:13,255
Cass, you stupid bastard.

101
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,124
Stupid? He was trying to help us.

102
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:16,692
Yeah, exactly.

103
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,027
- So, what now?
- I don't know.

104
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,630
Oh, crap.

105
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,799
What?

106
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,367
I can feel them.

107
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:27,569
Thought we'd find you here.

108
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,807
Playtime's over, Dean.

109
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:34,676
Time to come with us.

110
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:35,911
You just keep
your distance, ass-hat.

111
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,714
You're upset.

112
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,883
Yeah. A little.

113
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:43,152
You sons of bitches
jump-started judgment day!

114
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,821
Maybe we let it happen.
We didn't start anything.

115
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,223
Right, Sammy?

116
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,459
You had a chance to stop
your brother, and you couldn't.

117
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:52,862
So let's not quibble
over who started what.

118
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:56,531
Let's just say it was
all our faults and move on.

119
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,300
'Cause like it or not...

120
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:02,471
...it's apocalypse now.

121
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:04,473
And we're back
on the same team again.

122
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,008
Is that so?

123
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:07,877
You want to kill the devil.
We want you to kill the devil.

124
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,511
It's... Synergy.

125
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,348
And I'm just
supposed to trust you?

126
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,216
Cram it with walnuts, ugly.

127
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,418
This isn't a game, son.

128
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:19,889
Lucifer is powerful
in ways that defy description.

129
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:23,192
We need to strike now,
hard and fast.

130
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,860
Before he finds his vessel.

131
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:26,095
His vessel?

132
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,998
Lucifer needs a meat suit?

133
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,665
He is an angel.

134
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:34,236
Them's the rules.

135
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:35,604
And when he touches down,

136
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:38,874
We're talking four horsemen,
red oceans, fiery skies...

137
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,642
The greatest hits.

138
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,644
You can stop him, Dean.

139
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,047
But you need our help.

140
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:48,951
You listen to me,
you two-faced douche...

141
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,621
After what you did, I don't want
jack squat from you!

142
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,456
You listen to me, boy!

143
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,526
You think you can rebel against us?

144
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,295
As, Lucifer did?

145
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,897
You're bleeding.

146
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,599
Oh, yeah.

147
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,303
A little insurance policy
in case you dicks showed up.

148
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:11,640
No!

149
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,851
Learned that from my friend
Cass, you son of a bitch.

150
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,222
This sucks ass.

151
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:54,883
- Hey.
- Hey.

152
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,386
Uh... Here.

153
00:08:58,355 --> 00:09:01,823
Hex bags. No way the angels
will find us with those.

154
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,158
Demons, either, for that matter.

155
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,593
- Where'd you get it?
- I made it.

156
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,427
How?

157
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:11,766
I... I learned it from, Ruby.

158
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,272
Speaking of...

159
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,074
How you doing?

160
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,676
Are you jonesing for another hit
of, bitch blood or what?

161
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,812
I... It's weird.

162
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,048
Uh, tell you the truth, I'm fine.

163
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:27,649
No shakes, no fever.

164
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,886
It's like whoever... put me on that plane
cleaned me right up.

165
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:33,688
Supernatural methadone.

166
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:34,923
Yeah, I guess.

167
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:39,294
- Dean...
- Sam.

168
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,931
It's okay. You don't
have to say anything.

169
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,136
Well, that's good.

170
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:49,704
Because, what can I even say?

171
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:52,274
"I'm sorry"?
"I screwed up"?

172
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:56,178
Doesn't really do it justice, you know?

173
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:59,248
Look, there's nothing
I can do or say,

174
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:00,882
that will ever make this right...

175
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,285
So why do you keep
bringing it up?!

176
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,658
Look, all I'm saying is,

177
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,726
Why do we have to put this
under a microscope?

178
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:15,397
We made a mess.
We clean it up. That's it.

179
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:19,368
All right, so,
say this is just any other hunt.

180
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:21,036
You know, what do we do first?

181
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:24,973
We'd, uh, figure out
where the thing is.

182
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,208
All right.

183
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:28,444
So we just got to find...

184
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:29,678
The devil.

185
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,631
All right, keep it together.

186
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,800
Keep it together, man.

187
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,117
Aaah!

188
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:18,053
It's you, Nick.

189
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,422
You're special.

190
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,324
You're chosen.

191
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:47,926
"And then, Sam touched".

192
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,161
No.

193
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,530
"...Caressed, Dean's clavicle.

194
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:54,900
"'This is wrong'. Said, Dean.

195
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:58,304
"'then I don't want to be right,'

196
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:01,507
replied, Sam. In a husky voice."

197
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:12,351
Oh... My god.

198
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:14,820
You.

199
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:16,622
- You're...
- Carver Edlund, yeah. Hi, Becky.

200
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,790
You got my letters.

201
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,358
And my marzipan.

202
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:21,660
Yeah, yeah.
Um... yummy.

203
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:22,695
But, uh...

204
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:25,464
I am your number-one fan.

205
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:28,900
You know, I'm samlicker81.

206
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,469
I'm sorry. You're... You're what?

207
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:32,170
Web-mistress, at more than brothers. Net?

208
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:35,106
Oh, yeah. No, yeah.
You're my... number one fan.

209
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:37,676
That's why I contacted you.

210
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,311
You're the only one
who will believe me.

211
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:42,080
Are you all right?

212
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:43,081
No.

213
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:44,950
I'm being watched.

214
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:48,086
Okay, not now. At least, I don't think so.

215
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,055
But I don't have much time.

216
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,457
I need your help.

217
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:54,192
You need my help?

218
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,694
That's right.

219
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:59,431
I need you to get a message,
to, Sam and Dean.

220
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,734
Okay.

221
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,372
Look, Mr. Edlund...

222
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:09,575
Yes, I'm a fan, but I really
don't appreciate being mocked.

223
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:12,244
I know that "Supernaturals"
just a book, okay?

224
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,212
I know the difference
between fantasy and reality.

225
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,347
Becky, it's all real.

226
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,783
I knew it!

227
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,985
But then how would
you explain an earthquake,

228
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,653
A hurricane, and multiple tornadoes.

229
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,655
All at the same time,
all around the globe?

230
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:25,557
Two words. Carbon emissions.

231
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,325
Yeah, right, wavy gravy.

232
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:43,942
You okay, lady?

233
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,012
Sam... is it really you?

234
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,181
And you're so firm.

235
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,452
Do I know you?

236
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,954
No. But I know you.

237
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:57,556
You're, Sam Winchester.

238
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:58,557
And you're...

239
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,027
...not what I pictured.

240
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:05,464
I'm, Becky.

241
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:07,733
I read all about you guys.

242
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,067
And I've even written a few...

243
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,638
Anyway...

244
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,339
Mr. Edlund told me where you were.

245
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,774
Chuck?

246
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,378
He's got a message,
but he's being watched.

247
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:21,647
Angels.

248
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,749
Nice change-up to the mythology,
by the way.

249
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:25,250
The demon stuff
was getting kind of old.

250
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:27,619
Right. Just, um...
what's the message?

251
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,187
He had a vision.

252
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:32,290
"The, Michael sword is on earth.
The angels lost it."

253
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:33,358
The, Michael sword?

254
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:34,693
Becky, does he know where it is?

255
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,863
In a castle, on a hill made of 42 dogs.

256
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,998
42 dogs?

257
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,700
Are... you sure
you got that right?

258
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:45,170
It doesn't make sense,
but that's what he said.

259
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,906
I memorized every word...

260
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:50,642
For you.

261
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,579
Um...

262
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:55,981
Becky, uh, can you...
quit touching me?

263
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,783
No.

264
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,042
Hey, Bobby.

265
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,847
Good to see you boys
all in one piece.

266
00:16:30,683 --> 00:16:31,917
You weren't followed, were you?

267
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:33,218
You mean by angels,

268
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,754
demons, or Sam's new super-fan?

269
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:37,022
You heard.

270
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,457
I heard, romeo.

271
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:42,494
So... sword of, Michael, huh?

272
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:44,295
You think we're talking
about the actual sword

273
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:45,831
From the actual, archangel?

274
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,465
You better friggin' hope so.

275
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,971
That's, Michael.
Toughest sum-bitch they got.

276
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:57,275
You kidding me? Tough?

277
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,077
That guy looks like, Cate Blanchett.

278
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:01,847
Well, I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark
alley, believe me.

279
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:04,082
He commands the heavenly host.

280
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,251
During the last
big dust-up upstairs,

281
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,187
He's the one who booted,
Lucifer's ass to the basement.

282
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:10,656
Did it with that sword.

283
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:11,990
So if we can find it...

284
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:13,458
We can kick the devil's ass
all over again.

285
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:16,828
All right. So, where do we start?

286
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,564
Divvy up, and start reading...

287
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:21,667
Try and make sense
of, Chuck's nonsense.

288
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:35,413
Kid?

289
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:36,615
You all right?

290
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:40,852
No, actually.

291
00:17:42,822 --> 00:17:44,489
Bobby, this is all my fault.
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:45,624
Sam...

293
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,292
Lilith did not break
the final seal.

294
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:50,762
Lilith was the final seal.

295
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,964
Sam, stop it.

296
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:55,166
I killed her,
and I set, Lucifer free.

297
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,334
You what?!

298
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:59,004
You guys warned me
about, Ruby.

299
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:01,974
The demon blood,
but I didn't listen.

300
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,408
I brought this on.

301
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:17,422
You're damn right
you didn't listen.

302
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,626
You were reckless and selfish
and arrogant.

303
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:21,893
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:23,095
Oh, yeah?

305
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:27,833
You're sorry you started, Armageddon?

306
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:31,937
This kind of thing
don't get forgiven, boy.

307
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,944
If, by some miracle,
we pull this off...

308
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:42,714
I want you to lose my number.

309
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:44,182
You understand me?

310
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,327
There's an old church nearby.

311
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:00,465
Maybe I'll go read
some of the lore books there.

312
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:01,933
Yeah.

313
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,001
You do that.

314
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:33,298
I never would have guessed
that your daddy was right.

315
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:34,632
About what?

316
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:37,069
About your brother.

317
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:39,004
What, John said...

318
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:40,872
You save, Sam or kill him.

319
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:44,609
Maybe...

320
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,044
Maybe what?

321
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:48,714
Maybe we shouldn't have tried
so hard to save him.

322
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:49,948
Bobby.

323
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:52,150
He ended the world, Dean.

324
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:54,953
And you and I weren't strong
enough to stop him proper.

325
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,921
That's on us. I'm just saying.

326
00:19:57,857 --> 00:19:59,324
Your dad was right.

327
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:03,061
Dad.

328
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:08,366
It's got to be in here somewhere.

329
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:09,701
What the hell
are you talking about?

330
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,670
Here.

331
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:14,405
I don't believe it.

332
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:15,741
I don't believe it.

333
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,075
What the hell is it?

334
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:19,845
It's a card for my dad's lockup
in upstate New York.

335
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:21,046
Read it.

336
00:20:21,114 --> 00:20:24,149
"Castle storage, 42 rover hill."

337
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,451
Castle on a hill of 42 dogs.

338
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,956
So you think your dad had the,
Michael sword all this time?

339
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,791
I don't know. I'm not sure what else,
Chuck could have meant.

340
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,360
Yeah.

341
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:36,628
Okay.

342
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,096
It's good enough for me.

343
00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:12,225
I always knew you were
a big, dumb, slow,

344
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:13,560
dim pain in the ass, Dean.

345
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,199
But I never dreamt
you were so V.I.P.

346
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,470
I mean, you're gonna ice the devil?

347
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:24,504
You?

348
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:27,073
If I'd have known that,

349
00:21:27,141 --> 00:21:30,577
I'd have ripped your pretty,
pretty face off ages ago.

350
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:31,777
Ruby.

351
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:34,347
Try again. Go back further.

352
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:36,749
Meg?

353
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,684
Hi.

354
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:43,756
These are the days
of miracle and wonder, Dean.

355
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,358
Our father's among us.

356
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:47,660
You know, we're all dreaming again

357
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:50,296
For the first time
since we were human?

358
00:21:50,364 --> 00:21:52,098
It's heaven on earth.

359
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,199
Or hell.

360
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:57,270
We really owe your brother
a fruit basket.

361
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:59,439
My god, you like the sound
of your own voice.

362
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:00,673
But you, on the other hand,

363
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,975
You're the only bump in the road.

364
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:05,378
So every demon...
Every single one...

365
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,580
Is just dying for a piece of you.

366
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:09,682
Get in line.

367
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,984
Oh, I'm in the front
of the line, baby.

368
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:12,885
Let's ride.

369
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:22,595
What is that? Peanut butter?

370
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:25,097
You know, your surrogate
daddy's still awake.

371
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,999
Screaming in there.

372
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:29,068
And I want him to know how it feels

373
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:30,503
Slicing the life out of you.

374
00:22:33,174 --> 00:22:34,073
Bobby...

375
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:37,644
Bobby!

376
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,112
No!

377
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:41,514
Now!

378
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:50,356
Aaaah!

379
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:02,602
No!

380
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:06,339
Heya, Sammy.

381
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:08,308
You miss me? 'Cause I sure missed you.

382
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,775
Meg?

383
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:23,289
It's not so easy without those
super-special demon powers,

384
00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:25,325
Huh, Sammy?

385
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:41,974
Aaaaaaaaaah!

386
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:37,423
No!

387
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:38,991
N-No!

388
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,628
No!

389
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:44,364
No!

390
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:46,065
No!

391
00:25:46,132 --> 00:25:49,502
No, god, no!

392
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:52,104
Need some help here!

393
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:53,939
What happened?
He was stabbed.

394
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:55,641
Can we get a gurney?

395
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:02,047
Just wait here.

396
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:03,916
No, no, we... We can't
just leave him!

397
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:05,385
Just don't move.
I've got questions.

398
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:09,555
- Sammy, we got to go.
- No. no way, Dean.

399
00:26:09,623 --> 00:26:10,990
The demons heard
where the sword is.

400
00:26:11,057 --> 00:26:12,258
We got to get to it
before they do,

401
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:13,893
If we're not too late already.

402
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,794
Come on!

403
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:04,777
I see you told the demons
where the sword is.

404
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:06,612
Oh, thank god.
The angels are here.

405
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,047
And to think...

406
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:10,249
They could have grabbed it
any time they wanted.

407
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,121
It was right in front of them.

408
00:27:16,189 --> 00:27:18,157
What do you mean?

409
00:27:18,224 --> 00:27:20,493
We may have planted that
particular piece of prophecy

410
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:23,930
Inside, Chuck's skull,
but it happened to be true.

411
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:25,498
We did lose the, Michael sword.

412
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,934
We truly couldn't find it.

413
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:30,135
Until now. You've just
hand-delivered it to us.

414
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:31,971
We don't have anything.

415
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:37,409
It's you, chuckle-head.

416
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:43,182
You're the, Michael sword.

417
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:55,183
What, you thought you
could actually, kill, Lucifer?

418
00:27:56,182 --> 00:28:01,119
You simpering wad of insecurity
and self-loathing?

419
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:02,987
No.

420
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,722
You're just a human, Dean.

421
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,625
And not much of one.

422
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:09,394
What do you mean,
I'm the sword?

423
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:10,695
You're, Michael's weapon.

424
00:28:10,763 --> 00:28:13,498
Or, rather, his... receptacle.

425
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:16,734
I'm a vessel?

426
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:17,635
You're the vessel.

427
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:20,705
Michael's vessel.

428
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:22,807
How? Why... Why me?

429
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,343
Because you're chosen!

430
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,678
It's a great honor, Dean.

431
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:27,812
Oh, yeah.

432
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,348
Yeah, life as an angel condom.

433
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,717
That's real fun.

434
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:34,519
I think I'll pass, thanks.

435
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:38,557
Joking. Always joking.

436
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:41,359
Well... no more jokes.

437
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:45,063
Bang.

438
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:46,198
God!

439
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:47,599
You son of a bitch!

440
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,168
Keep mouthing off, I'll
break more than his legs.

441
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,908
I am completely and utterly
through, screwing around.

442
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:59,444
The war has begun.
We don't have our general.

443
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:00,745
That's bad.

444
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:03,248
Now, Michael is going
to take his vessel,

445
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:06,184
and lead the final charge
against the adversary.

446
00:29:06,252 --> 00:29:07,586
You understand me?

447
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:10,188
How many humans die
in the crossfire, huh?

448
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,023
A million? 5, 10?

449
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:13,458
Probably more.

450
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:15,494
If, Lucifer goes unchecked,
you know how many die?

451
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:17,395
All of them. He'll roast the planet alive.

452
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:22,534
There's a reason
you're telling me this.

453
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:25,103
Instead of just nabbing me.

454
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,605
You need my consent.

455
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:30,041
Michael needs my say-so
to ride around in my skin.

456
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,278
Unfortunately, yes.

457
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:35,547
Well, there's got to be another way.

458
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:37,315
There is no other way.

459
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:39,184
There must be a battle.

460
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:40,952
Michael must defeat the serpent.

461
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,086
It is written.

462
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,022
Yeah, maybe.

463
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:46,158
But, on the other hand...

464
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:47,058
Eat me.

465
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:49,761
The answer's, no.

466
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:50,862
Okay.

467
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:52,397
How about this?

468
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:54,499
Your friend Bobby...
We know he's gravely injured.

469
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,568
Uh, say yes, and we'll heal him.

470
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:58,102
Say no, he'll never walk again.

471
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,042
No.

472
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:06,611
Then how about
we heal you from...

473
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,214
Stage-4 stomach cancer?

474
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:20,925
No.

475
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:22,561
Then let's get really creative.

476
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:25,897
Uh, let's see how...
Sam does without his lungs.

477
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:32,770
Are we having fun yet?

478
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:38,410
You're going to say yes, Dean.

479
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:40,445
Just kill us.

480
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:42,080
Kill you?

481
00:30:43,148 --> 00:30:45,217
Oh, no.

482
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:47,018
I'm just getting started.

483
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:27,359
How are you...

484
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:28,360
Alive?

485
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:30,862
That's a good question.

486
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:33,365
How did these two
end up on that airplane?

487
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:35,199
Another good question.

488
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,835
'Cause the, angels didn't do it.

489
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:39,871
I think we both know
the answer, don't we?

490
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:41,973
No.

491
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,708
That's not possible.

492
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,976
It scares you.

493
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:47,479
Well, it should.

494
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:50,582
Now, put these boys
back together and go.

495
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,684
I won't ask twice.

496
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,231
You two need to be more careful.

497
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,900
Yeah, I'm starting to get that.

498
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,369
Your frat brothers are
bigger dicks than I thought.

499
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:13,438
I don't mean the, angels.

500
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:16,174
Lucifer is circling his vessel.

501
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,542
And once he takes it,

502
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,811
Those hex bags won't be
enough to protect you.

503
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:25,617
What the hell was that?

504
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:28,052
An, enochian sigil.

505
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,955
It'll hide you from every angel in creation,

506
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:32,357
Including, Lucifer.

507
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:33,858
What, you just brand us with it?

508
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:35,126
No. I carved it, into your ribs.

509
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:41,065
Hey, Cass. Were you really dead?

510
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,133
Yes.

511
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:46,904
Then how are you back?

512
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:06,891
Nick.

513
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:09,994
Nick.

514
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:14,999
You're dreaming, Nick.

515
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:19,537
But it doesn't mean this isn't real.

516
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:20,438
Sarah?

517
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:28,380
I'm not your wife, Nick.

518
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:30,482
I'm an, angel.

519
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:34,085
An, angel?

520
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:36,921
My name is, Lucifer.

521
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:42,226
Sure.

522
00:33:42,294 --> 00:33:43,428
Naturally.

523
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:45,630
Um...

524
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:47,899
Could you do me
a favor there, Satan,

525
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:50,835
And remind me to quit drinking
before I go to bed?

526
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,438
I'm here because you're special, Nick.

527
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:58,510
There's very, very few people like you.

528
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:00,278
Is that so?

529
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:03,481
You're a vessel. A very powerful vessel.

530
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:07,251
Meaning what, exactly?

531
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:12,023
I need to take control
of your mind and your body.

532
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:17,028
To be honest...

533
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,196
It'll probably be unpleasant for you.

534
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,965
But it is necessary.

535
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,067
Okay, look...

536
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:25,870
If it's just the same to you,
I think I'd like to wake up now.

537
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,339
I told you. This is real.

538
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,076
Don't be afraid.

539
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:33,912
This is your choice.

540
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:37,582
You need to invite me in.

541
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,584
Even if this is real.

542
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:43,120
Which it's not,
but assuming it was...

543
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:45,723
Why the hell would I do
something like that?

544
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:50,562
You people misunderstand me.

545
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,866
You call me "Satan"
and "devil," but...

546
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:56,167
Do you know my crime?

547
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:01,506
I loved, god too much.

548
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:03,675
And for that, he betrayed me.

549
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:06,845
Punished me.

550
00:35:06,912 --> 00:35:09,814
Just as he's punished you.

551
00:35:09,882 --> 00:35:13,818
After all, how could, god stand idly by.

552
00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:16,120
While that man, broke into your home,

553
00:35:16,188 --> 00:35:18,823
and butchered your family in their beds?

554
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:21,960
There are only two rational answers, Nick.

555
00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:25,697
Either he's sadistic...

556
00:35:25,764 --> 00:35:28,700
Or he simply doesn't care.

557
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:33,137
You're angry.

558
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:36,073
You have every right to be angry.

559
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:38,075
I am angry, too.

560
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:40,277
That's why I want to find him...

561
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:42,780
Hold him accountable for his actions.

562
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,382
Just because he created us,

563
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:47,284
doesn't mean he can toy
with us, like play-things.

564
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:50,889
If I help you...

565
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:53,958
Can you bring back my family?

566
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,394
I'm sorry.

567
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:58,062
I can't.

568
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,035
But I can give you
the next best thing.

569
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:10,141
God did this to you, Nick.

570
00:36:11,977 --> 00:36:15,279
And I can give you justice.

571
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:16,681
Peace.

572
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:21,619
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

573
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,621
Because, contrary to popular belief,

574
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:26,223
I don't lie.

575
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:29,594
I don't need to.

576
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:34,365
What I need...

577
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:35,667
Is you.

578
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,873
Nick, I need you, to say yes.

579
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,354
Then yes.

580
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:17,047
"unlikely to walk again"?!

581
00:37:17,114 --> 00:37:19,515
Why, you snot-nosed
son of a bitch!

582
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:22,052
Wait till I get out of this bed!

583
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,555
I'll use my game leg
and kick your friggin' ass!

584
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:27,090
Yeah, you better run!

585
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:29,425
You believe that yahoo?

586
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:31,360
Screw him. You'll be fine.

587
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:35,498
So, let me ask the million-dollar question.

588
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:37,967
What do we do now?

589
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,771
Well...

590
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,674
We save as many as we can
for as long as we can, I guess.

591
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:46,876
It's bad.

592
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:48,878
Whoever wins, heaven
or hell, we're boned.

593
00:37:48,946 --> 00:37:50,513
What if we win?

594
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:52,048
I'm serious.

595
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:54,350
I mean, screw the angels
and the demons,

596
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:56,052
and their crap apocalypse.

597
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,655
They want to fight a war,
they can find their own planet.

598
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:03,059
This one's ours, and I say
they get the hell off it.

599
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:04,694
We take 'em all on.
We kill the devil.

600
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,395
Hell, we even kill, Michael
if we have to.

601
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:09,099
But we do it our own damn selves.

602
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,634
And how are we supposed to
do all this, genius?

603
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:13,203
I got no idea.

604
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:16,973
But what I do have
is a G.E.D.

605
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,375
And a "give 'em hell" attitude,
and I'll figure it out.

606
00:38:22,012 --> 00:38:24,680
You are nine kinds of crazy, boy.

607
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,785
It's been said.

608
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:31,520
Listen, you stay on the mend.

609
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:33,123
We'll see you in a bit.

610
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:36,659
Sam?

611
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:40,696
I was awake.

612
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,700
I know what I said back there.

613
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:49,305
I just want you
to know that...

614
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:51,007
That was the, demon talking.

615
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,480
I ain't cutting you out, boy.

616
00:38:57,547 --> 00:38:58,447
Not ever.

617
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:05,955
Thanks, Bobby.

618
00:39:06,023 --> 00:39:08,191
You're welcome.

619
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:10,593
I deserve a damn medal for this,

620
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:13,129
But... you're welcome.

621
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:25,141
You know, I was thinking, Dean...

622
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:26,810
Maybe we could
go after the colt.

623
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:28,511
Why? What difference
would that make?

624
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:29,879
Well, we could use it on, Lucifer.

625
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:31,447
I mean, you just said back there...

626
00:39:31,515 --> 00:39:33,416
I just said a bunch of crap
for, Bobby's benefit.

627
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,987
I mean... I'll fight.

628
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:40,656
I'll fight till the last man,
but let's at least be honest.

629
00:39:40,724 --> 00:39:42,658
I mean, we don't stand
a snowball's chance,

630
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,794
And you know that.

631
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:47,430
I mean, hell, you of
all people know that.

632
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:48,664
Dean...

633
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,538
Is there something
you want to say to me?

634
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:05,849
I tried, Sammy.

635
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:08,151
I mean, I really tried.

636
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:12,488
But I just can't keep pretending
that everything's all right.

637
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:16,726
Because it's not.

638
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:18,394
And it's never going to be.

639
00:40:18,462 --> 00:40:21,564
You chose a demon
over your own brother,

640
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:23,032
And look what happened.

641
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,069
I would give anything... Anything

642
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:27,436
To take it all back.

643
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:28,704
I know you would.

644
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:33,476
And I know
how sorry you are. I do.

645
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:34,944
But, man...

646
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:39,648
You were the one
that I depended on the most.

647
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,819
And you let me down
in ways that I can't even...

648
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:49,993
I'm just...

649
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,862
I'm having a hard time
forgiving and forgetting here.

650
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,730
You know?

651
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,634
What can I do?

652
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:02,538
Honestly?

653
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,108
Nothing.

654
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:11,047
I just don't...

655
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:14,017
I don't think that we can
ever be what we were.

656
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:15,285
You know?

657
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:20,223
I just don't think that, I can trust you.
