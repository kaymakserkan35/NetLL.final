1
00:00:00,874 --> 00:00:02,309
I just don't think
I can trust you.

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,778
You think I'll take one
look at a demon

3
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:07,280
And suddenly
fall off the wagon,

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,050
As if, after everything,
I haven't learned my lesson.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,217
Well, have you?

6
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,823
- I know you don't trust me.
- So, what are you saying?

7
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:19,292
It's best we just
go our separate ways.

8
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:20,660
Well, I think you're right.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,662
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

10
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:24,797
You're the one, Sam.
you're my vessel.

11
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:26,899
That'll never happen.

12
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,835
You're the, Michael sword.

13
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:30,370
- What do you mean, I'm the sword?
- You're, Michael's weapon.

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,205
I'm a vessel?
you're the vessel.

15
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:34,774
If you want back in...

16
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:36,509
- I won't let you down.
- Oh, I know it.

17
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:45,352
All right, buddy,
what's so important

18
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:46,853
You couldn't tell me
over the phone?

19
00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:48,654
Trust me, Jim.

20
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:51,091
It's important.

21
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:54,527
Wait a minute. You're not...

22
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,529
You're not telling
me that this is...

23
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,431
- Yep.
- You've found it?!

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,705
You've found it

25
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:11,905


26
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:15,048
Oh... my... god.

27
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:17,850
Are you sure?

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,152
Vin number's a match.

29
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:22,088
Ohh...

30
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:23,390
How much you pay?

31
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,524
A lot.

32
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:25,825
Come on. how much?

33
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:26,545
A lot.

34
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:29,229
I'll bet.

35
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,333
Phew!

36
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,536
Wow.

37
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:39,805
You start her up yet?

38
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:41,074
Been waiting for you.

39
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:42,742
Yeah, waiting to rub
my nose in it, right?

40
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:44,277
Exactly.

41
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:46,146
Whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

42
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,348
We need to record this
for posterity's sake.

43
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:49,516
Great idea.

44
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:51,051
Yeah. great idea

45
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:51,891
Ohh that...

46
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:00,393


47
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:12,355
Cal?!

48
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:17,877
Hey, you all right, man?

49
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:20,780
I thought I heard something.

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,849
Cal?

51
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,052
Something wrong.

52
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:34,760
Oh, my god.

53
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:38,645
Cal!

54
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,655
So, what's with this job?

55
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:05,091
Dude suffers a head-on
collision in a parked car?

56
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:06,792
I'd say that's
worth checking out.

57
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,595
Yeah, definitely.

58
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,631
Uh, but we got bigger
problems, don't you think?

59
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:14,134
I'm sure the apocalypse will
still be there when we get back.

60
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:18,671
Right, yeah, but, I mean,

61
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,540
If the colt is really
out there somewhere...

62
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,610
Yeah, we've been looking for
three weeks. We got bupkisss.

63
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,678
Okay.

64
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:27,347
But, Dean...

65
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:30,550
I mean, if we're gonna
ice the devil...

66
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,818
This is what we're doing, okay?

67
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:34,287
end of discussion.

68
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:43,129
It's just that this
is our first real case

69
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,964
back at it together.

70
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:47,066
You know, I think
we ought to ease into it,

71
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,501
Put the training
wheels back on.

72
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:51,771
So you think I
need training wheels?

73
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:53,773
No. "we." We need training wheels.

74
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:56,075
You and me, as a team.

75
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:57,210
Okay?

76
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,814
Okay.

77
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:07,187
I mean, I really want this
to be a fresh start, you know?

78
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:08,655
for the both of us.

79
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:16,979
Okay.

80
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:32,245
Agents, Bonham and Copeland.

81
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:34,414
Rick Carnegie.
good to know you.

82
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:36,816
- So you're here on account of, Cal Hopkins' death?
- That's right.

83
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,718
Well, afraid you came
a long way for nothing.

84
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:40,253
We already booked
the guy that did it.

85
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:44,324
I'm sorry. Who do
you think did it?

86
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,892
Cal? something wrong.

87
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:58,204
Sicko taped
his own handiwork.

88
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,507
I don't follow.

89
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,276
It was, Jim Grossman
that killed, Cal.

90
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:04,810
Wait. what?

91
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,647
Well, he was the only one
on the scene for miles.

92
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:08,748
They were best friends.

93
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:10,216
Most violent crimes
are committed

94
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:11,718
by someone
close to the victim.

95
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:14,687
And how exactly did, Jim
slam, Cal into a windshield

96
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,822
With all the force of an
80-mile-per-hour crash?

97
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,759
Drugs, maybe?

98
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,930
Look, you know
this ain't brain surgery, boys.

99
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,267
Whatever it looks like,
that's what it usually is.

100
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,434
It's simple.

101
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,936
"Simple." right.

102
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:32,004
Right.

103
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,306
Um, if you don't mind,

104
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:35,508
We'd like to speak
to, Jim Grossman anyway.

105
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,143
I was in the house
when it happened.

106
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:38,411
I didn't even see it.

107
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,613
And for argument's sake,
say we believe you.

108
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:41,981
Why would you? the cops didn't.

109
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,349
We're not your typical cops.

110
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,017
Please, just tell us
what you saw.

111
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:46,653
It's not what I saw.
it's what I heard.

112
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:51,557
Tires squealing,
glass breaking.

113
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,694
It was the car that did it.

114
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,164
The car?

115
00:05:58,164 --> 00:05:59,565
I mean, I heard about the curse,

116
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:01,167
But I just thought
it was a load of crap.

117
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,935
Curse? what do you mean, curse?

118
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:05,004
The car, little bastard.

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,808
Lit... little bastard?

120
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:10,042
As in the, little bastard?

121
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,411
Wait, wait. what's little bastard?

122
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,646
It's, James Dean's car.
it's the one he was killed in.

123
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:15,080
Yeah, that's the one.

124
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,417
Cal had been looking for it for years.

125
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:18,551
I mean hell, we both had.

126
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,654
But he found it first.

127
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,958
Oh, we are definitely
checking this out.

128
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:34,166
So, what, this is like, "Christine"?

129
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,935
No, "Christine" is fiction.

130
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:37,470
This...

131
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,840
This is real.

132
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,443
Okay, enlighten me.

133
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:45,411
Well after, James Dean died

134
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:47,246
his mechanic bought the wreckage,

135
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:49,315
and he fixed it up.

136
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:52,985
and it repaid him
by falling on him.

137
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:54,420
Then, Tony Mchenry was killed

138
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,055
When it locked up
on the racetrack.

139
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:58,924
I mean, death follows
this car around like exhaust.

140
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:01,527
Nobody touches it and
comes away in one piece.

141
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:03,229
Hmm...

142
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:06,999
Then in 1970, it vanished
off the back of a truck.

143
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,602
Nobody's ever seen it since.

144
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,838
I'm telling you, man, if this...

145
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,272
if this car is little bastard,

146
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:14,774
I will bet you
dollars to doughnuts

147
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:16,075
It's what killed the guy.

148
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:17,543
So, how do we find out?

149
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:18,911
Well, Cal matched
the vin number,

150
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,581
But the only real way to know
is the engine number.

151
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:24,384
I'm guessing the engine number...

152
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:27,854
On the engine. Yeah.

153
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:34,960
You want me to do it?

154
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,710
No.

155
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,965
No, no... I've got it.

156
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,505
Okay, baby...

157
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,673
I'm not gonna
hurt you, so...

158
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:50,142
don't hurt me.

159
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:17,737
Need a flashlight?

160
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:18,487
No.

161
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,108
Don't do anything.
just go away.

162
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:25,110
You... uh, okay.

163
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,546
Don't speak, all right?

164
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:29,549
In fact, don't even look at her.
she might not like it.

165
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:08,187
Find out who owned it.

166
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,856
Not just the last owner...

167
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:12,825
You got to take it
all the way back to 1955.

168
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:14,927
That's a lot of research.

169
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:18,598
Well, I guess I just
made your afternoon.

170
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:25,738
- So, you want to be an actress, huh?
- Yeah.

171
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:27,940
That is... that is so funny.

172
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,543
because I am actually...

173
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:33,345
An agent for, William Morris endeavor.

174
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:34,947
Wow.

175
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,018
You mind filling me up again?

176
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:40,352
Yeah.

177
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:43,489
Hey, you're a star, all right?

178
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:45,591
- Yo.
- Hey, took me a while,

179
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:47,393
But I traced all the car's
previous owners.

180
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:48,661
Any of them die bloody?

181
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,829
Nope, in fact...

182
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:53,165
Dean, are you in a bar?

183
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:56,035
No, I'm... I'm in a restaurant...

184
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:58,370
Here's your beer.

185
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,540
Thanks.

186
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,341
...that happens to have a bar.

187
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:04,476
I've been working
my ass off here.

188
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:06,245
Hey, world's
smallest violin, pal.

189
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,380
I spent the afternoon
up, Christine's skirt.

190
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,749
I needed a drink.

191
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:10,850
Actually, you didn't.

192
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,117
Meaning?

193
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:13,953
The car's first owner
was a cardiologist

194
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:17,056
In Philadelphia... drove it
till he died in 1972.

195
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:18,424
So you're saying...

196
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,027
That Porsche is not,
nor has it ever been,

197
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:22,361
James dean's car.

198
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:23,963
It's a fake little bastard.

199
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:25,698
Well, then, what was it
that killed the guy?

200
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:27,132
Good question.

201
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,541
Okay, Mr. Hill. I finish.

202
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,778
Thank you, Consuela.
have a good night.

203
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,758
Oh, my god.

204
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:55,494
It's you.

205
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:57,897
You're dead.

206
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,899
You're supposed to be dead.

207
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:03,469
No.

208
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,106
No.

209
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:10,476
No, no, no.

210
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:26,423
I want you to use
a fine-tooth comb.

211
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:29,359
The evidence is here.
just got to find it.

212
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,394
Heard you got
another weird one.

213
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:34,064
Well, it's a... it's a little
strange on the surface, I admit,

214
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:38,368
But, you know,
once you look at the facts...

215
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:41,238
William Hill died from
a gunshot wound to the head.

216
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:44,341
No gun, no gunpowder, no bullet.

217
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,076
Nope. Nothin' strange about that.

218
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,646
Well, there's got to be
a reasonable explanation

219
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:50,881
there always is.

220
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,415
Well, what's your
reasonable explanation?

221
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:55,986
Professional killer.

222
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,587
Come again?

223
00:11:57,587 --> 00:12:00,690
CIA, NSA, one of them trained assassins...

224
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,092
Like in "Michael Clayton."

225
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:07,797
Right.

226
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:10,968
You're welcome
to look around, but...

227
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:12,769
but these guys
don't leave fingerprints.

228
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,037
Mind if we talk
with the witness?

229
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:16,806
Oh, be my guest.
she's not making any sense.

230
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:18,942
And she's not making any sense
in Spanish, either.

231
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:21,745
Right.

232
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:24,447
<i>no puedo vivir aquí.
necesito mi familia.</i>

233
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,450
<i>me voy ahora.
me voy a la casa.</i>

234
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,621
<i>no -- me voy a la casa
en el salvador ahora.</i>

235
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:33,023
Consuela Alvarez?

236
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:34,157
Yes?

237
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:35,157
FBI.

238
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:37,961
Now, you said
you saw something

239
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:39,229
In the professor's house.

240
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:40,497
Right? something in the window.

241
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:42,266
<i>estaba sacando la basura.</i>

242
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:46,303
<i>imiré por la ventana y vi al
hombre que mató al señor hill!</i>

243
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:49,239
<i>uh, señora alvarez.
cálmese, por favor.</i>

244
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,489
Uh...

245
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:55,645
<i>uh, díganos lo que vio.</i>

246
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:56,980
Nice.

247
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,181
Freshman Spanish.

248
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,884
<i>era alto, muy alto.</i>

249
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:03,387
<i>y llevaba
el abrigo negro largo</i>

250
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,055
<i>y tenía bigotes.</i>

251
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:07,124
Okay, uh...

252
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,825
Tall man. very tall.

253
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:11,494
With a long black coat.

254
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:14,097
And, uh, a beard?
beard.

255
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,632
<i>y un sombrero.</i>

256
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:17,200
Dude was wearing
a sombrero?

257
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,602
A-a hat. not a-a...

258
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:21,371
<i>no, no, no.
un sombrero alto.</i>

259
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:23,440
A tall hat?
oh, like a top hat?

260
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,708
<i>iun sombrero alto!</i>

261
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,810
<i>muy alto.</i>

262
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,678
What, you mean like a...

263
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:30,247
- <i>like a stovepipe hat?
- sí.</i>

264
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,015
Oh, yeah, you know,
like, Abraham Lincoln.

265
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:35,352
Sí. el presidente Lincoln.

266
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:40,357
Abraham Lincoln
killed Mr. Hill.

267
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,093
Huh.

268
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,096
S-so I go home now?

269
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:47,730
Uh, sí. gracias.

270
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,032
Gracias.

271
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:50,567
Uh...

272
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:10,854
Whoa.

273
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:11,955
What?

274
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,893


275
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:20,197
Here's a freeze-frame
from, Jim Grossman's video.

276
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:25,202
Am I crazy, or does that
look like, James Dean?

277
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:28,105
That looks like
James Dean.

278
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,478
<i>so, we got, Abraham Lincoln
and James Dean?</i>

279
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:35,979
Famous ghosts?

280
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:37,514
Maybe.

281
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,715
Well, that's just silly.

282
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:43,786
No, actually, uh, there's
a ton of lore on famous ghosts.

283
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:45,788
More than the, you know,
not-famous kinds.

284
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:48,058
I'm actually surprised
we haven't run into one before.

285
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:50,560
Yeah, but now we got two of them?
two extremely pissed-off ghosts?

286
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,929
Who are apparently ganking
their fans. what do you mean?

287
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:56,599
Professor Hill
was a civil war nut.

288
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,867
He dug, Lincoln.

289
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,137
and Cal must have been
a, James Dean freak.

290
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:03,240
He spent 17 years of his life
tracking down the guy's car.

291
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,908
So, you're saying
that we've got

292
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:07,477
Two super-famous,
super-pissed-off ghosts

293
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:09,812
killing their super fans?

294
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,450
That's what it looks like.

295
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,454
well, that is muchos loco.

296
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:18,855
"Muy."

297
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:21,925
Not "muchos."

298
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:24,294
Yeah, well,
the big question is,

299
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,029
What the hell
are they doing here?

300
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,998
Yeah, ghosts usually haunt
the places they lived.

301
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:31,935
I mean, I get, Abraham Lincoln
at the white house.

302
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:34,671
And James Dean
at a racetrack, but...

303
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,473
What the hell are
they doing in, canton?

304
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,485
You got to be kidding me.

305
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,170
What?

306
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:58,361
You got to be kidding me.

307
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,318
Dude, he's short.

308
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:22,352
Hey.

309
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:24,887
Gandhi was a great man.

310
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:27,424
Yeah, for a Smurf.

311
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,060
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting.

312
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,829
This is our busiest
time of the year.

313
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,266
This is busy?

314
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:39,169
W-well, n-not right now.
but it's early.

315
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,737
It's 4:30.

316
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:42,472
So, what can I do for you?

317
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:44,608
well, we are writing a piece
for travel magazine.

318
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:49,045
Yeah, on how totally non-sucky
wax museums are.

319
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:50,247
That's fantastic!

320
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:51,648
A little press...
just what we need.

321
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:53,750
Great, well, we're interested
in a few of your exhibits,

322
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,386
Specifically, Abraham Lincoln
and James Dean

323
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:57,820
two of our
most popular displays.

324
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,223
Oh, yeah? so they bring in
a lot of visitors?

325
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:01,291
Yeah, we have our regulars.

326
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,692
I don't suppose

327
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:04,361
That a... William Hill
and Cal Hopkins

328
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:05,695
Were regulars, were they?

329
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:08,198
As a matter of fact, they were.

330
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:11,834
I heard what happened to them.
that's tragic, just tragic.

331
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:14,371
Well, that's not gonna
be in the article, is it?

332
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:15,805
No. no, no.
of course not.

333
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:17,574
You know, I got to tell you,

334
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:19,942
That... that Lincoln
is so life like.

335
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:24,181
I mean, you know, you can
just imagine him moving around.

336
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,582
You ever see anything like that?

337
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,985
Uh, no.

338
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,789
Well, is there anything
you can think of

339
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,258
That would make
your museum... unusual?

340
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:37,126
You know, for the article.

341
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:39,762
Well, I'll say. there isn't another
place like us, not anywhere.

342
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:43,266
How so? well, for one,
that's honest, Abe's real hat.

343
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:45,802
It is?

344
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:48,405
Almost like his remains.

345
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:52,676
Ugh. I guess.

346
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:54,477
You wouldn't
happen to have

347
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:56,446
Any of, James Dean's
personal effects, would you?

348
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,181
Yeah, got his key chain.

349
00:17:58,181 --> 00:17:59,616
We got a bunch of stuff...

350
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:02,652
Uh, Gandhi's bifocals,
FDR's iron lung,

351
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:04,020
This.

352
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,156
And who did that belong to?

353
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:10,193
The Fonz.
seasons 2 through 4.

354
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:11,761
W-wow.

355
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,364
Yeah, that's...
that's really cool... ish.

356
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:15,699
Oh, this? this is nothing.

357
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:17,967
I've been working on
a new collection of figures,

358
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:19,336
Stuff that'll really wow the kids.

359
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:21,371
- The kids?
- Yeah, gen "y."

360
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:25,041
Computer games,
cellphones, "sexting",

361
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,943
they're just fads.

362
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,846
I'm gonna make wax
museums hip again.

363
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:31,648


364
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,404
Yeah, Abraham Lincoln
and James Dean.

365
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:55,938
Can you believe that?

366
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:57,507
Why so kill-crazy?

367
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:01,177
Ah, maybe the apocalypse has
got them all hot and bothered.

368
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:03,112
Yeah, well, we all know
whose fault that is.

369
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:05,348
Yeah, well I'm sorry but it's true.

370
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:12,255
I'll call you later. Bye.

371
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,590
What's going on?

372
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,091
Did you get
the trunk packed up?

373
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:17,360
Yeah, the trunk's packed.
who was on the phone?

374
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,028
- Bobby.
- And?

375
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:19,929
Nothing.

376
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:23,633
So, we're just gonna pretend
I didn't hear what I just heard?

377
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:27,504
Pretend or don't pretend,
whatever floats your boat.

378
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:30,373
This was supposed to be
a fresh start, Dean.

379
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,208
Well, this is about as fresh as it gets.

380
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,043
Now, we going or not?

381
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:42,719


382
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:10,380
Check it out.

383
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,982
Four score
and seven years ago,

384
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:14,818
I had a funny hat.

385
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:16,986
Dean.

386
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:18,855
I can't have any fun with this?

387
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:21,257
Let's just torch the objects,
torch the ghosts,

388
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:22,525
and get out of here, okay?

389
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,193
I'll go grab "east of Eden's" key chain.

390
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:09,588
Dean!

391
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:14,711
Dean!

392
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:31,327


393
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:48,177


394
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:56,018
Dean!

395
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,687
- Is that, Gandhi?!
- Yeah!

396
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,121
Dude, he's squirrelly.

397
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:00,056
Get the...

398
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:05,762
Get the what?!

399
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:07,430
Glasses!

400
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:15,772


401
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,311


402
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:26,048
You couldn't have been
a fan of someone cool?

403
00:22:28,752 --> 00:22:30,887
Really? Gandhi?

404
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:40,912
You ready to blow this joint?

405
00:22:40,912 --> 00:22:43,548
Dean, didn't it strike you as strange,

406
00:22:43,548 --> 00:22:45,851
the way, Gandhi
just vanished?

407
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:47,086
Strange how?

408
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,621
No screaming, no big flame-out.

409
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:51,023
I mean, that isn't the way
ghosts usually go.

410
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:52,458
Still... I torched, he vanished.

411
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,826
Yeah, but I...

412
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:54,760
also, I feel like he was...

413
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,962
Trying to get
a bite out of me.

414
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,231
A bite?

415
00:23:00,231 --> 00:23:01,865
Yeah, like he was hungry.

416
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:04,935
but the thing is, Gandhi...
or the real, Gandhi...

417
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:06,203
He was a...

418
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:08,371
A what?

419
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:11,307
Spit it out.

420
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:13,676
He was a fruitarian.

421
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:17,347


422
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:20,150
Let me get this straight.

423
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,852
Your ultimate hero

424
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:23,787
Was not only
a short man in diapers,

425
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:25,789
But he was also
a fruitarian?

426
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,624
- That's not the point.
- That is good.

427
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:29,226
That is... even for you, that is good.

428
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:31,995
Look, I'm just saying I'm not
so sure this thing is over.

429
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,897
It was a ghost.

430
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:36,633
It was a weirdly supercharged
fruitarian ghost

431
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:38,334
but it was still a ghost.
now let's go.

432
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:41,437
So, first, you drag me into town,

433
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:43,240
and now you're
dragging me back out?

434
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,408
You ain't steering this boat.

435
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,277
Let's go. chop-chop.

436
00:23:47,277 --> 00:23:48,745
You know, this isn't gonna work.

437
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:52,015
What isn't?

438
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,750
Us. you, me... together.

439
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,685
I thought it could, but it can't.

440
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,687
You're the one
that wanted back in, chief.

441
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,289
And you're the one
who called me back in.

442
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:02,058
I still think we got
some trust-building to do.

443
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:04,727
How long am I gonna be
on double-secret probation?

444
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,129
Until I say so.

445
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:10,366
Look...
I know what I did,

446
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,601
What I've done

447
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,603
and I am trying to climb
out of that hole.

448
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:14,737
I am,

449
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:16,106
but you're not making it any easier.

450
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,008
So, what, am I supposed to
just let you off the hook?

451
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:20,243
No. you can think
whatever you want.

452
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:22,112
I deserve it and worse.

453
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:25,248
Hell, you'll never punish me
as much as I'm punishing myself

454
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:27,517
but the point is,

455
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:29,886
If we're gonna be a team, you and I,

456
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,888
It has to be
a two-way street.

457
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:35,225
So we just go back
to the way we were before?

458
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,160
No, because we were never
that way before.

459
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,328
"before" didn't work.

460
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,096
How do you think
we got here?

461
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:41,998
What's that
supposed to mean?

462
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:46,636
Dean, one of the reasons
I went off with, Ruby...

463
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:47,971
was to get away from you.

464
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,773
What?

465
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:53,076
It made me feel strong,

466
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,245
Like I wasn't
your kid brother.

467
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:58,915
are you saying
this is my fault?

468
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,817
No, it's my fault

469
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:03,353
all I'm saying is that
if we're gonna do this,

470
00:25:03,353 --> 00:25:04,787
we have to do it different,

471
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:07,690
we can't just fall
into the same rut.

472
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,326
What do you want me to do?

473
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,795
You're gonna have to
let me grow up, for starters.

474
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:15,999


475
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:24,824
Yeah?

476
00:25:29,213 --> 00:25:32,482
Yeah. yeah, okay.

477
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:37,820
I guess you were right
about this not being over.

478
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,561
Sheriff Carnegie.

479
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:46,930
Sheriff, what happened?

480
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,199
I, uh, um...

481
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,234
I don't know.

482
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,075
Excuse us, girls.
Hi, we're with the, FBI.

483
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,044
Can you tell us
what happened?

484
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:03,046
It was horrible.

485
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,347
Way horrible.

486
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:05,382
What was horrible?

487
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:06,849
I thought she'd be nice.

488
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:08,518
I still can't believe it.

489
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:09,552
Believe what?

490
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:11,054
She took, Danielle!

491
00:26:11,054 --> 00:26:11,988
Who?

492
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:16,326
It's okay. you're safe.
just tell us.

493
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,760
Who took your friend?

494
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:20,596
It was...

495
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:21,664
Paris Hilton.

496
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,600
Sorry?

497
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,902
She looked
really good, though.

498
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:28,571
- Skinny.
- Skinny and fast.

499
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:30,506
What... Wh... huh?

500
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,343
Um, where did they go?

501
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,011
We don't know.

502
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,646
They just vanished.

503
00:26:36,646 --> 00:26:40,516
Would you excuse us
for just a minute?

504
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,254
Paris Hilton's not dead,
as far as we know, right?

505
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,521
Pretty sure, no.

506
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,990
Which means it's not a...

507
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,758
Ghost, no.

508
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:51,261
So either, Paris Hilton's
a homicidal maniac or...

509
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,229
Or we missed something.

510
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:55,365
What do you want to do?

511
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:10,780


512
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,983


513
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,756
Whew! that's ripe.

514
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:30,433


515
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,810
What the hell?

516
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:44,680


517
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,049
I can't believe i missed it.

518
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:47,317
Missed what?

519
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,985
Went back over
the other two vics.

520
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:50,353
There was blood loss... major.

521
00:27:50,353 --> 00:27:52,522
Yeah, well, being a gory smear
will do that to you.

522
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:53,990
No, no, I mean more blood loss

523
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,992
than a car crash or a
head wound should cause.

524
00:27:55,992 --> 00:27:57,360
- Almost like...
- Something's feeding.

525
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,495
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

526
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:00,497
and then... there were these.

527
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,634
What are those, seeds?

528
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:07,103
Yeah, they were
in both vics' bellies.

529
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,738
I hope you washed your hands.

530
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:11,141
They're unlike any other seed
I've ever seen before, dean.

531
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:14,144
Wow, just when I thought
you couldn't get any geekier.

532
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:25,955
Yahtzee!

533
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,823
What?

534
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:29,426
The seeds aren't
from around here.

535
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:31,461
In fact, they're not from any
tree or plant in the country.

536
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,129
Where are they from?

537
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,198
Eastern Europe,
from a forest in the Balkans,

538
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:36,766
Which is not even there anymore

539
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:38,435
it was chopped down
like 30 years ago.

540
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:39,185
So?

541
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:42,372
So, local legend has it
that the forest was guarded

542
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:45,141
By a pagan god
whose name was, Leshi...

543
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:48,478
A mischievous god,
could take on infinite forms.

544
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,481
And let me guess...
he liked to munch on his fans.

545
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,450
Huh... yep.

546
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,418
"could be appeased only with
the blood from his worshipers."

547
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:56,786
It would drain them

548
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,721
Then stuff their stomachs
with the seeds.

549
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:00,690
How's he doing it?

550
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,626
What, he touches
James Dean's key chain

551
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:07,063
and then morphs
into, James Dean?

552
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:10,266
Hmm. that's good a guess as any.

553
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:13,436
Yeah, well, whatever.
how do we kill him?

554
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:16,772
Says here to chop off his head
with an iron axe.

555
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:18,741
All right.

556
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:21,511
Let's go gank ourselves
a, Paris Hilton.

557
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:10,260


558
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,001
Hey.

559
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,124
She alive?

560
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:45,261
Yeah, barely.

561
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,303


562
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,012
Awesome.

563
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,899
Ohh...

564
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,701
I'm so glad
you're awake for this.

565
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,404
This is gonna be huge.

566
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,744
Super. I wouldn't want to miss it.

567
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:55,648
I mean, I've been stuffing
myself with fast food lately.

568
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,283
So it's nice to
do the ritual right,

569
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,153
Prepare a nice, slow
meal for a change.

570
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,655
Just like the good
old days, huh?

571
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,791
You have no idea.

572
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,060
people adored me.

573
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,929
They used to throw themselves at me,

574
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,164
With smiles on their faces.

575
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:15,133
Yeah, I guess these days,
nobody gives a flying crap

576
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,736
about some backwoods
forest god, huh?

577
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,443
No, not since they
cut down my forest

578
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,711
To build a Yugo plant.

579
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,046
March of progress, sister.

580
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,450
For years now,
I've been wandering.

581
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,819
Hungry, scared.

582
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,889
Scrounging for scraps.

583
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,123
so not sexy.

584
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,359
But then...

585
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,462
The best thing ever happened...

586
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,764
Someone tripped
the apocalypse.

587
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,867
And I thought, what the hell...

588
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,335
I'm tired of watching what I eat.

589
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,605
I want to pig out.

590
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:54,807
So I found this little place.

591
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,009
It's awesome.

592
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,478
Adoring fans
stroll right in the door.

593
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,381
Yeah, but they're not your fans.

594
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,131
So?

595
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:06,852
They worship Lincoln, Gandhi, Hilton.

596
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,721
Whatever. I'll take what I can get.

597
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,455
You know,
I got to tell you,

598
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,190
You are not the first god we've met,

599
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,192
but you are the nuttiest.

600
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,896
No. you, you people.

601
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:18,497
You're the crazy ones.

602
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,699
You used to worship gods.

603
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,002
But this?

604
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,337
This is what passes for idolatry?

605
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,740
Celebrities?

606
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,509
What have they got besides
small dogs and spray tans?

607
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,547
You people used to
have old-time religion.

608
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:36,181
<i>now you have us weekly.</i>

609
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,616
I don't know.

610
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,518
I'm more of a penthouse
forum man, myself.

611
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,485


612
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,490
Maybe, but...

613
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,061
There's still a lot of yummy
meat on those bones, boy.

614
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,331
Well, I hate to break it
to you, sister, but, uh...

615
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,801
You can't eat me.

616
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:58,771
See, I'm not
a, Paris Hilton, BFF.

617
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:01,273
I've never even seen
"house of wax."

618
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:03,392
No.

619
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:06,845
But I can totally
read your mind, Dean.

620
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,714
I know who your hero is.

621
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:09,915
Your daddy.

622
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:13,085
Am I right?

623
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,753


624
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,922
and this belonged to him.

625
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,958
Didn't it?

626
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,060
Poor little, Dean.

627
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,862
All you ever wanted
was to be loved by your idol.

628
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:27,265
One distant father figure,
coming right up!

629
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,151


630
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:50,923


631
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:03,802
Not a word.

632
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,303
Dude.

633
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:09,407
You just got whaled on
by, Paris Hilton.

634
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,076
Shut up.

635
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:23,033
All right. thank you.

636
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:25,436
Sheriff Carnegie.

637
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:27,304
Danielle's gonna be all right.

638
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:28,973
She's sworn off
"the simple life,"

639
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,140
but other than that...

640
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,375
Glad she's okay.

641
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,210
It gets better...

642
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,245
Sheriff's putting out an, APB on, Paris Hilton.

643
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:36,546


644
00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:39,450
That ought to be good.

645
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:46,623
Hey, listen, I was thinking
about what you said yesterday...

646
00:35:46,623 --> 00:35:49,226
about me keeping
too tight of a leash on you.

647
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,562
Well, maybe you're right.

648
00:35:54,665 --> 00:35:56,633
I mean, look, I'm not
exactly Mr, innocent

649
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:58,102
In this whole mess, either.

650
00:35:58,102 --> 00:35:59,803
you know, I did
break the first seal.

651
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:02,039
- You didn't know.
- yeah, well, neither did you.

652
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,708
I'm not saying demon blood
was a great way to go,

653
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,576
But you did kill, Lilith,

654
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,546
and start the apocalypse.
which neither of us saw coming.

655
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:11,615
I mean, who would've thought killing
Lilith would've been a bad thing?

656
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:18,155
Point is, I was so worried
about watching your every move

657
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:20,157
that I didn't see what
it was actually doing to you.

658
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:25,262
So, for that, I'm sorry.

659
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:27,131
Thanks.

660
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:33,770
So, where do we go from here?

661
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,040
The way I see it, we got
one shot at surviving this.

662
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,374
What's that?

663
00:36:37,374 --> 00:36:38,575
Maybe I am on deck
for the devil.

664
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:39,809
Maybe the same
with you and Michael.

665
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:40,911
Maybe there's
no changing that.

666
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:43,080
Well, that's encouraging.

667
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,282
but we can stop wringing
our hands over it

668
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:47,451
we got to just grab on
to whatever's in front of us,

669
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:49,353
kick its ass,
and go down fighting.

670
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:54,491
I can get on board with that.

671
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:55,992
Okay.

672
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:58,462
But we're gonna have to
do it on the same level.

673
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,534
You got it.

674
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:09,706
What do you say
we get the hell out of here?

675
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:10,874
Hell yeah.

676
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:12,642


677
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:13,944
Hey.

678
00:37:21,086 --> 00:37:22,252
You want to drive?

679
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:26,457
You sure?

680
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:29,993
Yeah, I could, uh...
I could use a nap.
