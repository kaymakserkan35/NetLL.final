all his bases, I guess.

more Swedish babes.

hamburger than your mother

So you hate him because
the lives he saves aren't
as good as the lives you save?

on your hands,
I'm guessing a new cat.

No. My mother's dead.

Poor cat. You're allergic.

Forget the pills.
We'll give you a nasal spray.

It says something about you.

Yes.

There's an evolutionary
imperative why we give a crap
about our family and friends.

215

And there's an evolutionary
imperative why we don't give
a crap about anybody else.

all people indiscriminately,

Does it go to 1 1?

to feel nauseous.

What he just did...
Abusive and unprofessional.

If he hadn't done it,
we wouldn't have
seen the problem.

possibly fatal, particularly

to a phone line

Better yet, you could join me
at one of my clinics.

that without
the technological crutches,

255
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,359
you become
a better diagnostician.

can handle this, right?

talk about it over dinner.

to Africa or on a date?

the world, I can't ask you
to a restaurant a block away?

Well, one's a job,
and the other's...
Yeah, hospital regs.

your precious objectivity.

either question, by the way.

objectivity's important?

cling to objectivity

argument is that when you
have millions of people dying,

is to be yelling
at the top of your lungs.

before we put
the pacemaker in.

into a stairwell
to get his heart racing.

he's selfish?

00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,331
Which is it, Dr. House?

326
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,867
I'll arrange the biopsy.
Thanks.

327
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,916
CAMERON: He asked me out.
I'm shocked.

328
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,383
I'm shocked when patients
don't ask you out.

329
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,687
He also asked me
to come to Africa.

330
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,598
Boy, he moves fast.

331
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,293
I think the two questions
had two different objectives.

332
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:03,467
Do you like him?
Good-looking single guy,
genius doctor,

333
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,935
cares about the world.
I take it you said no.

334
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,038
You think
I'm that hung up on rules?
He's not House.

335
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,241
There's nothing there.

336
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,323
Yeah, there is.

337
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,019
Did I ask you to plant a PPD?

338
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,190
It was positive. He's got TB!

339
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,293
Well, of course he's got TB.
The guy's been
in the jungle for 20 years.

340
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:36,304
If he tested positive
for pinkeye, would you think
that was his big problem?

341
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,900
I did a test. It was positive.
Why is that a problem?

342
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,468
Because now he's got
the big red target on his arm,

343
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,311
the stubborn jerk thinks
he's right. He won't let us
do any more tests.

344
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,749
Well, maybe he's not
the only stubborn jerk.

345
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,219
I did an LP, too.
Low glucose, and he has
an increased sed rate.

346
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,417
Everything screams
tuberculosis!
Not everything!

347
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,757
If any of the symptoms
are caused by the TB, it would
throw off our diagnosis.

348
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,725
You're right.
We gotta treat the TB.

349
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,834
Who knows?
Maybe he'll just get better.

350
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,909
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

351
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,615
So, it's TB, but not TB?

352
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,892
I'm complicated.
The guy
does know tuberculosis.

353
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,326
If he says it can manifest...
The guy's
not even a real doctor.

354
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,330
He's a human telethon.
Is that your problem with him?

355
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,798
You see hypocrites every day.
Why is this guy so special?

356
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,495
You think I have
a hypocritical attitude
to hypocrisy?

357
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,233
The problem is, there are 26
letters in the alphabet
and he only uses two of them.

358
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,434
He treats
thousands of patients
with one diagnosis.

359
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,500
He knows the answer
going in. It's cheating.

360
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,446
So it's all because
he's one of them
useless specialists?

361
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,350
Oh, did I hurt
the big-time oncologist's
itty-bitty feelings?

362
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,184
HOUSE: You're a big help
to patients who actually
have cancer.

363
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,522
Other times
you're just annoying.
You've outdone yourself.

364
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,855
I'll say. My salad's covering
a free T-bone steak.

365
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,190
Cecelia Carter, remember her?

366
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,791
Last week they said it was
mystery stew. They owe me.

367
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,326
She was just in my office
crying because of the way
you treated her.

368
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,895
That doesn't sound like you.

369
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,634
Then it probably wasn't.

370
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,541
I get that you like
to shock people,

371
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,942
stun them out of complacency,
out of stupidity.

372
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,239
But this woman thought
she had cancer.

373
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,616
She had a lump in her breast.
What were you trying
to accomplish?

374
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,054
Let me ask you something.
If this were another doctor,

375
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,953
if the patient were
complaining about, let's say,
I don't know, Foreman,

376
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,794
you'd just dismiss this
as the paranoid bitching
of another paranoid bitch.

377
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,197
And file it under "P" for...
Paranoid?

378
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,629
Am not.

379
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,803
You're right.
Good.

380
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,069
Apologize to her
before the end
of business today.

381
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,043
What did you do to Ceci?
I have no idea.

382
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,174
Just the salad today.
Big breakfast.

383
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,409
Hey.

384
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,622
Levofloxacin?

385
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,818
You have
a resistant strain of TB.

386
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,528
Wow, you just
walk right in with these.
That's what we doctors do.

387
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:16,055
We write down the name
of some medicine,
and someone gives it to us.

388
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:20,594
You know, there's parts of
the world where you get knifed
walking around with this.

389
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,699
I mean, the regular stuff
is bad enough,

390
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,510
but the treatment
for the resistant strain?

391
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,737
(WHlSTLES)

392
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,913
They get $6 a tablet for that.

393
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,447
And I take it for two years.

394
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,079
Streptomycin. Now,
that's two grand.

395
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,426
Ten grand, cure one person.

396
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,835
I had a patient in Djani once.

397
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:58,603
It was a mother,
had three little boys.

398
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,911
She had resistant TB.

399
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,711
She couldn't afford these.

400
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,907
She couldn't afford bread.

401
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,846
We gave her
the regular stuff, but

402
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,184
no surprise, she died.
Sorry.

403
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,468
I'm not taking these pills.

404
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,407
Because she couldn't get them,
you're not gonna take them?

405
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,112
That's insane.
Why?

406
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,876
'Cause I'm better than her?
Because letting her die
was wrong,

407
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,440
but letting you die
is just as wrong.

408
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,885
Maybe I won't die.

409
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,987
Maybe somebody will pay
a little more attention
to my story.

410
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,795
He figures
the pharmaceutical companies

411
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,561
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
need something big
to force them into action.

412
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,968
This'll get a lot more
media play than 1,000
African villagers dying.

413
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,528
So, he won't take the pills.

414
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,404
Newsweek's calling you.
And he won't agree
to any more tests.

415
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,568
He has his diagnosis.

416
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,043
See what happens
when you don't listen to me?

417
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,977
Maybe millions
of lives get saved.

418
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,038
Yeah. That's my point.

419
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,380
Increased heart rate,
night sweats,

420
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,388
Ioss of consciousness.
Besides rough sex, what do
they all have in common?

421
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,014
T...
It's not TB!

422
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,624
His autonomic nervous system?

423
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:24,150
We know that
it's not a brain tumor.
So what else could be
eating his nerves?

424
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,390
Fabry's. Autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

425
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,196
Shy-Drager syndrome.
It doesn't matter.
He won't let us test him.

426
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,066
(PHONE RlNGlNG)

427
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,902
In my opinion,
Dr. Sebastian Charles
is an idiot.

428
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,270
Yeah, you can quote me.
C-U-D-D-Y.

429
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,082
Sebastian is refusing
life-saving treatment.

430
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,022
He's refusing TB treatment.
You don't think he has TB.

431
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:56,117
Ergo, you should care less.
He won't let me test him.

432
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,220
And what do you want me
to do about it?
Hold him down.

433
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,095
Have you apologized
to Cecelia Carter yet?

434
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,794
Trust me, she doesn't
wanna hear from me.

435
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,269
Look, the guy
is killing himself!

436
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,772
Am I the only one who realizes
this is a bad thing?

437
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,106
If he was a Christian
Scientist refusing meds,
we'd have 18 attorneys...

438
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,245
You're putting on makeup.

439
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,181
That's not a good sign
for my side, is it?

440
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,551
Sebastian has called
a press conference for 3:00.

441
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,283
He's asked me to be there
to confirm the diagnosis
and the prognosis.

442
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,987
You are as big
a media whore as he is.

443
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,929
Of course I am.
It couldn't possibly
be that I think he's right,

444
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,296
and that I'd like to be
a small part
of what he's doing.

445
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,168
Oh, whores can like the sex.
Doesn't mean
they're not whores.

446
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:44,602
And with that eye shadow,
I am totally screwed,
aren't l?

447
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,038
Totally.

448
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,440
CAMERON: How you feeling?
A little weak.

449
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,314
You're having a good day.

450
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,580
The symptoms
will quickly focus more
and more on your lungs.

451
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,921
You'll find it
difficult to talk
and eventually breathe at all.

452
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,857
I think I know what I'll have
to look forward to.

453
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:03,917
I know.

454
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,430
I just came to ask
if you'd be willing
to accept any treatment.

455
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:12,232
No, if you're trying
to scare me into...
No. Palliative treatment.

456
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,198
Narcotics.

457
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,241
Fentanyl patch, morphine drip,
whatever it takes.

458
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,367
We can make your last days
fairly comfortable.

459
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:25,008
And if you have
another good day,
maybe dinner.

460
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:29,851
Thank you.

461
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,899
You want
Third World treatment?
You got it.

462
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,429
Boy, is it hot here in Djani.
What are you doing?

463
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,870
What am I doing?

464
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,465
Putting everything
on the floor of the hut.

465
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,505
What's the magic box
with the moving pictures?

466
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,740
You think he's a hypocrite?
Hypocrite? No.

467
00:26:56,815 --> 00:27:00,046
Everybody in Africa's
got cell phones
and running water.

468
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,488
This thing just
will not flush.

469
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,754
Do you really think
that if you come in here
and make it a little hot,

470
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,021
make it smell a little,

471
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,758
that I'm just gonna fold
and abandon everything
that matters to me?

472
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,361
Lousy sanitation
over there, too.

473
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,736
You are not the same as them.
Your life is not the same.

474
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,535
And you're cheapening
everything they're going
through by pretending you are.

475
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,075
I am the same.
I'm not special.

476
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,544
You can't demand
to be treated like any
Third World sick person

477
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,707
and call a press conference!
They treat me special!

478
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,950
That doesn't mean I am.

479
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:38,549
And what kind of selfish jerk
wouldn't take advantage
of that fact?

480
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,435
It's all preventable.

481
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:59,108
Stoia Tucker makes medications
right here in New Jersey.

482
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,874
They have warehouses full of
the stuff. There's more than
enough to go around.

483
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,041
So if I can get them,
why can't Lemma?

484
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,276
Why can't Quesmo?
And why can't Sarni?

485
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:17,518
Another person just died.
Where is your outrage?

486
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,559
SEBASTlAN: No,
I have no jntentjon
of martyrjng myself.

487
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,724
I'm just puttjng myself...

488
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,598
Sure, they're dying,
but it's got a great beat.

489
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,965
Must be hot as hell
under those lights.
Yep.

490
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,870
Hey, why the page?

491
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,909
He okay?
He's in a coma.

492
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,911
I need you to
apologize to Ceci, Cecily.

493
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,815
Mrs. Carter? For what?
For whatever I did.

494
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,944
You didn't do anything.
That has been
my position all along.

495
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,048
CUDDY: Hjs chest x-rays
are negatjve, so he's not
contagjous at thjs pojnt.

496
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,649
Hjs condjtjon
js currently stable.

497
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,561
Do you ever notice how all
the self-sacrificing
women in history,

498
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,289
Joan of Arc, Mother Teresa,

499
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,931
can't think of any others,
they all die alone.

500
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:03,064
The men, on the other hand,
get so much fuzz it's crazy.

501
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,631
It's an unfair world.

502
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:09,373
House, she was scared
and unreasonable.
Insulting a woman
with breast cancer,

503
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:14,382
that's a move best left
to the pros. Frankly,
you don't have the chops.

504
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:19,048
I didn't insult her!
I did the unnecessary
biopsy like she wanted.

505
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,058
It was negative
like I knew it would be.

506
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,117
What'd you do,
call them perky?

507
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,753
You are years away
from mad skills like that.

508
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,765
I need you to apologize.

509
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,635
Cuddy's only doing this
because she thinks it's you.

510
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,534
Welcome to the world.

511
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,240
Everyone's different,
everyone gets
treated different.

512
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,277
And you try fighting that,
you wind up dying of TB.

513
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,540
What are you doing?

514
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,311
Testing the patient's
autonomic nervous system.

515
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:51,184
Of course.
His internal heating
and ventilation should be off.

516
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,689
He shouldn't be able to sweat.

517
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,952
That's why he's got
that awful body powder.

518
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,325
Take it away,
crank up the heat,
stick him under the lights,

519
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:02,162
he can't cool himself.
He should be turning
bright red.

520
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,700
The picture's fine.

521
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,462
SEBASTlAN: Yeah.

522
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,169
I'm askjng Stoja Tucker

00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,873
to save these lives,
millions of lives,

524
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,813
including my own.

525
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,981
Dr. House,
I would appreciate it
if you left us...

526
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,284
Get that out of my face.
CUDDY: What are you
tryjng to prove, House?

527
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,984
SEBASTlAN: Dr. House,
I would apprecjate jt
jf you left the room whjle...

528
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,390
He's sweating like a pig.

529
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,928
It's 1 00 degrees in here,
House, because you
turned up the thermostat.

530
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,760
Did they hear me?
The media, did they listen?

531
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,427
He's disoriented.
They have to hear me.

532
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,528
His arteries
are clamping down.
I want everybody
out of here now!

533
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,368
Get the crash cart.
He's having a cardiac arrest.

534
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,998
CUDDY: Get it set up.
CAMERON: All right.

535
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,335
Get them out!

536
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,745
Everyone. I want
everyone out of here now!

00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,457
Come on, Sebastian.

540
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,514
Clear.

541
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,221

00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:19,040
That js not TB.
Compelling television.

544
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,979
Do whatever tests you want.
I want to treat you for TB.

545
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,954
Dr. Cameron found low sugar
in your cerebrospinal fluid.

546
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,856
It's a classic finding of TB.
Oh, now you think
TB's the problem?

547
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,725
No.

548
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,457
If TB caused
cardiac arrest on a hot day,

549
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,466
your work in Africa would be
even more futile
than it already is.

550
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,331
Can you get
to your point, please?

551
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,032
That whiteboard in my office,
we're up to about
a dozen symptoms now.

552
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,803
Cardiac arrest,
clearly not TB.

553
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,204
CSF sugar clearly is TB.

554
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,506
The rest of them
could go either way.

555
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,812
Unless we know
which ones are which,
I can't diagnose you.

556
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,485
I'll take any other tests
or treatments
you might want to prescribe.

557
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,420
So you're not special,
but TB is.

558
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,592
People die of TB
because we let them.
It's our choice.

559
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:20,067
People die of malaria
because we let them.
They die of dysentery. They...

560
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,699
No, TB's my disease.
You own a disease?

561
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,343
Well, I'm sorry I missed
the lPO on dengue fever.

562
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:31,775
Look, I know I have a way
about me, and I know I piss
a lot of people off.

563
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,010
And a whole lot more
I just annoy.

564
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,210
But you're the first person
that I've ever met

565
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,915
who I think is actually
annoyed by what I do.

566
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,991
Do you think
I'm not saving any lives,
or is that a bad thing?

567
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,586
Right now, I'm just trying
to save your life.

568
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,029
Or do you just have
a problem with hope?

569
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:54,427
You know, the difference
between our jobs
is not numbers or styles.

570
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,338
It's that I know
I'm gonna fail. Even if
I save a million people,

571
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,505
there's gonna be
another million.
You couldn't handle that.

572
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,708
I think you resent
anyone who can.

573
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,151
Can't we just agree
that you're
incredibly annoying?

574
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,852
Take the pills,
or I'll let you die,

575
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,414
do an autopsy,
call my own press conference

576
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,561
and make sure the world knows
that you didn't die of TB.

577
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:21,189
Corporate sponsors will be
disappointed, but they'll find
another disease.

578
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,892
Why would you do that?

579
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,533
Because I'm just a mean
son of a bitch.

580
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:39,776
So, we still have to explain
PR variability, syncope,
headaches

581
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,475
and

582
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,737
Iow sugar?

583
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,545
That was classic TB.
Apparently not.

584
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,116
You rerun the test?
Yeah.

585
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,981
This is good.
Good? This is bizarre.

586
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,422
"Bizarre" is good.

587
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,324
"Common" has
hundreds of explanations.
"Bizarre" has hardly any.

588
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,092
What else could cause
low CSF sugar?

589
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,957
I get to ask the questions.

590
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,868
I've found you look a lot
smarter asking questions than
dumbly not answering them.

591
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,668
High insulin levels
in his blood.
They'd have to be very high.

592
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,402
Okay, very high
insulin levels in his blood.

593
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,308
How could he get
high insulin levels?

594
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,176
We've checked
daily blood sugars,
all normal.

595
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,012
See how smart she looks?
'Cause she asked the question.

596
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,076
And it's not glucagonoma
because he has no rash.

597
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,247
It's not self-induced
because he's not an idiot.

598
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,588
And it's not a tumor
because the CT and the MRl
were both negative.

599
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,424
Which just leaves tumor.

600
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,595
Why do you do this?
Why do you ignore what I say
like I'm not even...

601
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,104
Small tumor.
Really, really tiny.

602
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,640
So small we can't see it.

603
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,471
Nesidioblastoma.

604
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,740
An abnormal growth of
the insulin-secreting cells
in his pancreas?

605
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,976
That only intermittently
secrets insulin...

606
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:56,782
Iike if, I don't know,
if someone accidentally puts
the mechanical bull on 1 1.

607
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,252
Easily removed by surgery.

608
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,622
Except if it's so small
we can't see it,

609
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,251
how are we even gonna
prove it's there?

610
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,920
She asked, looking clever.

611
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,933
Just start hacking away
at his pancreas
until he gets better?

612
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,162
How do you prove
something exists
when you can't see it?

613
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,034
Does God exist?
Does the wind blow?

614
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,165
We know
because the leaves move.
Look for effects.

615
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,938
You should look
the other way.

616
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,070
There's Cuddy
with your patient.
CUDDY: Dr. House!

617
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,115
Dr. House has an emergency.

618
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,978
We can't avoid her forever.
Eventually she'll die.

619
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,017
You sure she doesn't
have breast cancer?

620
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,585
HOUSE: We think
you have a tumor.

621
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:37,387
Easily removed surgically.
We're gonna poke it
with a stick.

622
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,725
And if there's no tumor?
Nothing happens.

623
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,034
HOUSE: Splenic artery,
it's a hard left
off the celiac.

624
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,061
If there is a tumor?

625
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,235
What usually happens
when you poke something
with a stick?

626
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,435
Pokes back.

627
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,803
He's stuck in the
superior mesenteric.

628
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,738
I knew we should have
stopped for directions. Men!

629
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,842
I'm there.

630
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,348
We're gonna inject calcium
into your pancreas.

631
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,113
The beta cells
will release insulin.

632
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,682
If there are
too many beta cells
because of a tumor,

633
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,388
your blood sugar
will drop precipitously.

634
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,191
How do we know
it won't go too low?

635
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,632
Fingers and toes crossed.

636
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,565
HOUSE: Go ahead.

637
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,678
Glucose is holding
steady at 75.

638
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:42,559
No leaves rustling.
Blow harder.
I already gave him one amp.

639
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,255
Well, I guess now would be
the time to give him
more than one amp.

640
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,507
CAMERON: Fifty.
It's starting to drop.

641
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,575
Forty-five.
I think my arm's shaking.

642
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,951
I'm gonna start him
on a glucose drip.
He's gonna seize.

643
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,114
Not yet.

644
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,089
FOREMAN: It's continuing
to drop.
HOUSE: Not fast enough.

645
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,326
CAMERON: He's seizing.
We've got to reverse this.

646
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:33,576
He's at 40, 38, 35.

647
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,339
(ACCELERATED BEEPlNG)

648
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,750
Push an amp of D50.
You want to kill the guy?

649
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,627
CAMERON: We're back to 40.

650
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,400
Congratulations.
You have a tumor.

651
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,042
Are you gonna go out with him?

652
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,707
Is that any of your business?
Nope.

653
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,981
I don't think so.

654
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,180
Two days ago,
you were holding his hand.
What's changed?

655
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,591
He practically
lives in Africa.
There's no future.

656
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,658
On the other hand,
maybe there's too much
of a future now.

657
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,699
You weren't attracted to him
because he was prepared
to die for a cause.

658
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,931
You were attracted to him
because he was
actually doing it.

659
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,064
Right. It's that simple.
That was simple?

660
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,271
I put a label on him
and go from there.
Everybody does it.

661
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,938
We are
who people think we are.

662
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,345
People think
he's a great doctor,
so they give him stuff.

663
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,318
He is a great doctor.
The reality is irrelevant.

664
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,148
I'll prove it.

665
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:00,687
People who know me
see me as an ass,
treat me as an ass.

666
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,427
People who don't know me
see a cripple,
treat me like a cripple.

667
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,261
What sort of selfish jerk
wouldn't take advantage
of that fact?

668
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,073
(GROANS)

669
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:23,484
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

670
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,850
Yeah.
I am so sorry.

671
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,826
It was completely my fault.

672
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,624
It's nothing. I'm fine.

673
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,631
Well, I'm very relieved.
I feel terrible.

674
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:39,260
Please don't worry
about it. I'm fine.
You sure?

675
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,496
Okay.

676
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,643
How's everything?

677
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,543
I'm gonna go.
My foot's killing me.

678
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,215
What did you do to...
It was nothing.
It was all my fault.

679
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,993
Yeah, listen.
Bogale, relax, okay?

680
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,463
I'm gonna be back on Tuesday.

681
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,966
Tell Sarni I'm gonna bring her
a new brace. All right.

682
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,101
Just in case.
You get them?

683
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,675
Six-months' supply.
Should fix you right up.

684
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,536
I'll see you when you
come back for a refill?

685
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,306
Yeah, I'll see you
in two months.

686
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,108
You gonna give them away?

687
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:28,040
Well, you know how these
things happen. You leave
a bag on the airplane,

688
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,416
you drop some pills
down the drain.

689
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:35,119
I have an idea.
You could bring me
the refill in Africa.

690
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,291
I don't think so.

691
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,329
You actually like
working for House?
You find this satisfying?

692
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:14,958
WOMAN: There he is.

693
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,727
It's good to see you.
Dr. Sebastian.
Thank you.

694
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,633
Thank you. I appreciate that.
I appreciate the support.

695
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,035
It's not about the kids
dying every eight seconds.

696
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:27,703
It's about the media stroking,
adulation, the pats
on the head.

697
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,145
That's your problem
with him, isn't it?

698
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,115
Look at him.
Loves it, eats it up.

699
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,950
Yeah, the man actually
enjoys what he does.

700
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,952
Listen, I saved his life.

701
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,857
That means I get credit
for every life he saves
from here on out.

702
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,525
I'll make sure
Stockholm knows.
