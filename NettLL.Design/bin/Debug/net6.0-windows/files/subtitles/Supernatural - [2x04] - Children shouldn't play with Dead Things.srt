1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,380
he wants us to pick up
where he left off --

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,430
saving people,hunting things.
The family business.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,430
THEN

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,130
Today's your lucky day,kid.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,030
- You watch out for sammy,okay?
- Yeah,dad. You know I will.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,040
Dad.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,560
Time of death -- 10:41 A.M.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,990
I miss him,man,and I'm not all right.
Neither are you.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,970
I'm dealing
with dad's death!

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,650
Dad's dead,and it hurts so bad,
you can't take it.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,370
I'm okay! I swear,the next
person who asks if I'm okay,

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm gonna start
throwing punches.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,580
NOW

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,210
Okay,we got booze...

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,420
we got chocolate...

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,020
and...wait for it.

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,650
Tortured emo rock.

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,840
Guaranteed cure
for any broken heart.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,080
You didn't
have to do all this.

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,700
I'm fine.

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,470
Yeah,I can see that.

22
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,610
Thanks,neal.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,890
You're a good friend.

24
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,300
It's probably him.

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,410
I'll take care of it.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,700
Where is she?

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,810
Chill out
and think about this,okay?

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,330
- I need to talk to her.
- Some other time.

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,570
You get out of my face now.

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,280
Angela?

31
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,960
Leave...me...alone.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,730
Angela,I'm sorry.

33
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,930
You're sorry?

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,190
You're sorry?
Oh,that's great.

35
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,540
Angela,listen to me.

36
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,140
I don't want to listen to you!

37
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,890
- I'm done listening!
- Listen to me.

38
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,880
How could
you do this? I loved you.

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,290
Angela?

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,030
Angela!

Season 02 Episode 04</font>

44
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,660
Come on,sam.
I'm begging you. This is stupid.

45
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,700
Why?

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,870
Going to visit mom's grave?

47
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,130
She doesn't even have a grave.
There was no body left after the fire.

48
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,290
She has a headstone.

49
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,500
Put up by our uncle,
a man that we've never met.

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,980
You want to pay your respects
to a slab of granite put up by a stranger.

51
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,460
- That's not the point.
- Then enlighten me.

52
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,450
It's not about
a body or a casket.

53
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,250
It's about her memory,
okay?

54
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,850
And after dad,it just --

55
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,580
it just feels like
the right thing to do.

56
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,030
It's irrational
is what it is.

57
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,650
Look,man,
no one asked you to come.

58
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,340
Why don't we swing
by the roadhouse instead?

59
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,190
We haven't heard anything on the demon lately.
We should be hunting that son of a bitch down.

60
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,780
That's a good idea.
You should.

61
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,050
Just drop me off,I'll hitch a ride,
and I'll meet you there tomorrow.

62
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,940
Right.

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,360
Stuck with those people,
making awkward small talk until you show up.

64
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,160
No,thanks.

65
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,260
CHILDREN SHOULDN`T PALY WITH DEAD THINGS

66
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,400
I think,uh...

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,190
I think dad would have
wanted you to have these.

68
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,650
I love you,mom.

69
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,100
Thank you.

70
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,500
Angela mason.

71
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,600
She was a student at the local college.
Her funeral was three days ago.

72
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,280
And?

73
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,660
And?

74
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,210
You saw her grave --
everything dead around it in a perfect circle.

75
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,540
You don't think
that's a little weird?

76
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,730
Maybe the grounds keeper
went a little agro with the pesticide.

77
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,730
No,I asked him. No pesticide,no chemicals.
Nobody can explain it.

78
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,490
Okay,
so,what are you thinking?

79
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,050
I don't know.
Unholy ground,maybe.

80
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,890
what?

81
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,830
If something evil happened,it
could easily poison the ground.

82
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,230
Remember the farm
outside of cedar rapids?

83
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,930
Yeah.

84
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,020
It could be the sign
of a demonic presence...

85
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,820
...or the angela girl's spirit,
if it's powerful enough.

86
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,760
Well,don't get too excited.
You might pull something.

87
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,890
It's just stumbling
onto a hunt...

88
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,750
- here of all places?
- So?

89
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,270
So,are you sure this is about
a hunt,not something else?

90
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,740
What else
would it be about?

91
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,850
Just forget it.

92
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,900
Believe what you want,sam,

93
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,020
but I let you
drag my ass out here.
The least we can do
is check this out.

94
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,410
Yeah,fine.

95
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,420
The girl's dad works in town.
He's a professor at the school.

96
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,810
- Dr. Mason?
- YeS.

97
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,350
I'm sam.
This is dean.

98
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,400
We were friends
of angela'S.

99
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,020
We -- we wanted to offer
our condolences.

100
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,420
Please come in.

101
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,520
She was beautiful.

102
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,600
Yes,she was.

103
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,420
This is an unusual book.

104
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,690
It's ancient greek.
I teach a course.

105
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,100
So,a car accident.
That's -- that's horrible.

106
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,960
Angie was only a mile
away from home when...

107
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,980
it's got to be hard...
losing someone like that.

108
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,300
Sometimes it's like
they're still around,

109
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,510
almost like you can still
sense their presence.

110
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,280
You ever feel anything
like that?

111
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,110
I do,as a matter of fact.

112
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,970
That's perfectly normal,
dr. Mason,

113
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,290
especially with what
you're going through.

114
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,140
You know,
I still phone her.

115
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,430
And the phone's ringing
before I remember that,uh...

116
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,800
family's everything,
you know?

117
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,010
Angie was the most important
thing in my life.

118
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,900
And now I'm just lost
without her.

119
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,020
I'm very sorry.

120
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,070
There's something going on.
We just haven't found it yet.

121
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,560
Dean,so far you got a patch
of dead grass and nothing.

122
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,800
Well,something turned
that grave into unholy ground.

123
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,350
There's no reason
for it to be unholy ground.

124
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,660
Angela mason was a nice girl
who died in a car crash.

125
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,100
That's not exactly
vengeful-spirit material.

126
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,660
You heard her father.

127
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,450
Maybe daddy doesn't know  everything
there is to know about his little angel,

128
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,750
You know what? We never should
have bothered that poor man.

129
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,490
We shouldn't even
be here anymore.

130
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,560
So,what,sam?We just bail without even
figuring out what's going on?

131
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,720
I think I know
what's going on here.

132
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,400
It's the only reason
I went along with you this far.

133
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,610
- What are you talking about?
- This is about mom's grave.

134
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,710
Got nothing to do with it.

135
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,830
You wouldn't step
within 100 yards of it.

136
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,410
Look,maybe you're imagining
a hunt where there isn't one

137
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,250
so you don't have to think
about mom or dad.

138
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,160
You want to take another swing?
Go ahead

139
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,650
if it will make you feel better.

140
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,140
I don't need this crap.

141
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,040
Dean,where are you going?

142
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,710
I'm gonna go get a drink...

143
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,630
alone.

144
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,510
- Who the hell are you?!
- Wait,wait,wait,wait.

145
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,000
Hold on!

146
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,540
I'm calling 911!

147
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,090
- 'm angela's cousin.
- What?

148
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,380
Yeah,her dad sent me over
to pick up her stuff.

149
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,710
My name's alan --
alan stanwick.

150
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,830
Her dad didn't say
that you were coming.

151
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,760
Well,I mean...

152
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,840
How else would I have the key
to your place?

153
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:11,490
So,I'm sure you got a view of angela
that none of the family got to see.

154
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,560
Tell me,what was she like?

155
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,160
What was she really like?

156
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,150
She was great...

157
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,610
just...great.

158
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,190
I mean,she was so...

159
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,940
great.

160
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,390
Yeah.

161
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,230
Yeah.

162
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,540
You two must have been
really close,huh?

163
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,020
We were.

164
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,580
But it's not just her,
it's matt.

165
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,560
Who?

166
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
Angela's boyfriend.

167
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,260
Right -- matt.

168
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,110
Uh,what about him?

169
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,640
He killed himself last night.

170
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,900
He cut his own throat.
Who does that?

171
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,190
That'S...terrible.

172
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,350
He was taking angela's death
pretty hard,and I guess...

173
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,240
I mean,he'd been messed up
about it for days.

174
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,480
Messed up how?

175
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,370
He kept saying
that he saw her everywhere.

176
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,290
Well,I'm --
I'm sure that's normal.

177
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,250
I mean,with everything
he was going through.

178
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,960
He said that he saw her...

179
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,120
as in an acid trip
or something.

180
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,580
Were angela and matt
a happy couple?

181
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,340
I mean,was there any reason
that angela would be angry with him?

182
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,120
What?

183
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,880
No,of course not.
Why do you ask?

184
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,960
Just asking.

185
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,680
Where did matt live?

186
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,610
Next on cinemax,

187
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,710
"casa erotica iv,"

188
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,730
a tale of two latin beauties,

189
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,910
Hey.

190
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,280
What?

191
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,160
Awkward.

192
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,950
- Where the hell were you?
- Just working my imaginary case.

193
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,050
Yeah? And?

194
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,840
Oh,well,you were right.
I didn't find much.

195
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,770
Yeah. Except angela's boyfriend
died last night --

196
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,380
slit his own throat,
but,you know,that's normal.

197
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,720
Uh,let's see.
What else?

198
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,550
Oh,he was seeing angela
everywhere before he died.

199
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,880
But,you know,I'm sure  that's just me
transferring my own feelings.

200
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,430
Okay,I get it.

201
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,260
I'm sorry. Maybe there is
something going on here.

202
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,910
Maybe?

203
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,910
Sam,I know how to do my job
despite what you might think.

204
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,790
We should check out
the guy's apartment.

205
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,350
I just came from there...

206
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,280
a pile of dead plants
just like the cemetery.

207
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,040
Hell,a dead goldfish,too.

208
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,730
- So,unholy ground?
- Maybe.

209
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,710
I'm still not getting
that powerful angry-spirit vibe from angela.

210
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,280
I've been reading this,
though.

211
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,550
- You stole the girl's diary?
- Yeah,sam.

212
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,900
And if anything,
the girl's a little too nice.

213
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,320
So,what do you want to do?

214
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,110
Keep digging,
talk to more of her friends.

215
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,640
- You get any names?
- You kidding me?

216
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,020
I have her bestest friend
in the whole wide world.

217
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,620
I didn't realize the college
employed grief counselors.

218
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,810
Oh,yeah.

219
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,520
Yeah,you talk,we listen

220
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,630
and maybe throw in a little therapeutic
collage whatever helps jump-start the healing.

221
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,910
Well,I think I'm okay.
Thanks.

222
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,850
Well,you heard what happened
to matt harrison,right?

223
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,230
Yeah,I did.

224
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,980
We just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

225
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,380
Grief can make people
do crazy things.

226
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,720
Look,I'm sorry about
what happened to him.I am.

227
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,690
But if matt killed himself,
it wasn't 'cause of grief.

228
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,390
No?
Then why?

229
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,420
It was guilt.

230
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,770
Angie's death was matt's fault,
and he knew it.

231
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,620
How was matt responsible?

232
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,040
She really loved that guy,

233
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,620
but the night of the accident,
she walked in on him with another girl.

234
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,900
She was really torn up.
That's why she crashed.

235
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,370
Um,look,
I got to get ready for work,

236
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,790
so thanks for the concern,
but,seriously,I'll be okay.

237
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,680
Well,my vengeful-spirit theory
is starting to make a little more sense.

238
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,280
I mean,hell hath no fury.

239
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,350
So,if angela got her revenge
on matt,you think it's over?

240
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,790
Well,
there's one way to be sure.

241
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,740
Yeah?
What's that?

242
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,750
Burn the bones.

243
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,810
Burn the bones?

244
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,890
Are you high?
Angela died last week.

245
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,250
So?

246
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,840
So there's not gonna be bones. There's
gonna be a ripe,rotting body in the coffin.

247
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,810
Since when are you afraid
to get dirty,huh?

248
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,490
Ladies first.

249
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,440
Hold that.

250
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,670
I missed you.

251
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,150
They buried the body
four days ago.

252
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,620
I don't get it.

253
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,210
Look.

254
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,090
- What is that?
- I'm not sure.

255
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,160
I've seen these kinds
of symbols before.

256
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,040
Dean,take it easy,okay?

257
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,820
You're angie's friends.

258
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,350
- Dr. Mason --
- we need to talk.

259
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,890
Well,come in.

260
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,370
Thanks.

261
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,620
You teach ancient greek.

262
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,640
Tell me...

263
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,100
what are these?

264
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,630
I don't understand.

265
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,370
You said this had something
to do with angela.

266
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,500
It does.
Please,just humor me.

267
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,470
They're part of an ancient greek
divination ritual.

268
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,990
- Used for necromancy,right.
- That's right.

269
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,110
See,
before we came over here,

270
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,290
we stopped by the library and
did a little homework ourselves.

271
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,430
Apparently,
they use rituals like this one
for communicating with the dead,

272
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,320
even bringing corpses back to
life -- full-on zombie action.

273
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,230
Yeah.

274
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,490
I mean,
according to the legends.

275
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,450
Now,what's this all about?

276
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,510
- I think you know.
- Dean.

277
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,540
Look,I get it.

278
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,740
There are people that I would
give anything to see again,

279
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,910
but what gives you
the right?

280
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,160
- Dean.
- What are you talking about?

281
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,720
- What's dead should stay dead!
- What?

282
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,180
- Stop it!
- What you brought back isn't your daughter!

283
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,700
These things are vicious,
they're violent!

284
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,850
They're so nasty,
they rot the ground around them.

285
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,540
I mean,come on!
Haven't you seen "pet sematary"?

286
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,150
You're insane.

287
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,380
- Where is she?
- Get out of my house.

288
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,650
I know you're hiding her somewhere.
Where is she?!

289
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,960
Dean,stop!
That's enough.
Dean,look --

290
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,180
beautiful,living plants.
We're leaving.

291
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,350
- I'm calling the police.
- Sir,we're sorry.

292
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,010
We won't bother you again.

293
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,040
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Back off.

294
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,380
That man is innocent.
He didn't deserve that.

295
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,640
So she's not here. Maybe he's
keeping her somewhere else.

296
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,800
Stop it!
That's enough,okay? Enough!

297
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,150
- Sam,I know what I'm doing.
- No,you don'T...at all.

298
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,670
I don't scare easy,but you're
scaring the crap out of me.

299
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,140
Don't be overdramatic,
sam.

300
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,090
You're lucky this turned out
to be a real case,

301
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,180
'cause if it wasn't,you would've found
something else to kill.

302
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,070
You're on edge,
you're erratic,

303
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,880
except for when
you're hunting,'cause then
you're downright scary.

304
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,870
You're tailspinning,man,

305
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,380
and you refuse to talk about it,
and you won't let me help you.

306
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,870
I can take care of myself,
thanks.

307
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,750
No,you can't!

308
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,020
And you're the only one
who thinks you should have to.

309
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,420
You don't have to handle this
on your own. No one can.

310
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,170
- If you bring up dad's death one more time --
- dean,it's killing you. Please.

311
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,360
We've already lost dad.

312
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,200
We lost mom.

313
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,230
I've lost jessica.

314
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,190
And now I'm gonna
lose you,too?

315
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,580
We better get out of here
before the cops come.

316
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,190
I hear you,okay?

317
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,920
I'm being an ass,
and I'm sorry.

318
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,660
But we got a freakin' zombie running around.
We need to figure out how to kill it.

319
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,400
Right?

320
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,820
Our lives are weird,man.

321
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,100
You're telling me.

322
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,650
Come on.

323
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,720
Honey,
is something bothering you?

324
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,140
It's about matt.

325
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,990
Haven't we already
talked about that?

326
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,190
I know,but,uh --

327
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,750
haven't we wasted enough time
on him already?

328
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,460
Come sit down.

329
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,000
You always said
that he didn't deserve me.

330
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,250
- You were right.
- Angela...

331
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,430
you didn't get out
and go see matt or...

332
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,610
I've been here
the whole time.

333
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,870
Neal...you really think
I could do something like that?

334
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,580
No,I...
I don't know.

335
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,130
I can't help it.
You just -- you seem...

336
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,000
different?

337
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,990
You're right.
I am.

338
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,380
I've realized...

339
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,940
you're the only one
who ever really loved me.

340
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,410
You proved that.
You brought me back.

341
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,910
I'm with you now.

342
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,050
Isn't that
what you always wanted?

343
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,340
We can't just waste her
with a head shot?

344
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,160
Dude,you've been wahing
way too many romero flicks.

345
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,260
You're telling me there's
no lore on how to smoke them?

346
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,580
No,I'm telling you
there's too much.

347
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,660
There's 100 different legends
on the walking dead,

348
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,560
but they all have different
methods for killing them.

349
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,980
Some say
setting them on fire.
One said -- where is it?

350
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,340
Right here -- feeding
their hearts to wild dogs.

351
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,170
That's my personal favorite.

352
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,830
But who knows what's real
and what's myth?

353
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,410
Is there anything
they have in common?

354
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,640
No,but a few
said silver might work.

355
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,130
Silver's a start.

356
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,860
But now how are
we going to find angela?

357
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,540
We got to figure out
who brought her back.

358
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,160
Any ideas?

359
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,210
I think if it's not her dad,
it might be that guy,neal.

360
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,610
- Neal?
- Yep.

361
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,380
How'd you come up with that?
Well,you got your journal,I got mine.

362
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,190
"Neal's a real shoulder
to cry on.

363
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,980
He so understands what
I'm going through with matt."

364
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,070
There's more here where that came from. It's
got unrequited duckie love written all over it.

365
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,550
But that doesn't mean he
brought her back from the dead.

366
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,080
Hmm,did I mention that
he's professor mason's T.A.?

367
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,010
Has access
to all the same books.

368
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,250
Hello?

369
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,750
Neal!

370
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,150
It's your grief counselors.
We've come to hug.

371
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,180
Silver bullets?

372
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,380
Yeah,enough to make her rattle
like a change purse.

373
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,030
Unless it's where
he keeps his porn.

374
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,440
It sure looks like
a zombie pen to me.

375
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,850
Yeah.

376
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,390
An empty one.

377
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,750
You think angela's
gone after somebody?

378
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,240
No,I think she went out
to rent "beaches."

379
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,310
Look,smartass.
She might kill someone.

380
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,550
We got to find her,dean.

381
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,170
Yeah.

382
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,710
All right,she clipped matt
because he was cheating,right?

383
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,710
Yeah.

384
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,480
Well,takes two to,you know,
have hard-core sex.

385
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,420
I don't know.
It just seemed

386
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,950
that angela's roommate was...

387
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,090
broken up
over matt's death.

388
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,850
I mean,
like really broken up.

389
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,000
Hello?

390
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,820
Hi,lindsay.
I'm home.

391
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,000
You know what you did.

392
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,970
I'm sorry!

393
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,560
I am so sorry!

394
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,380
Not sorry enough!

395
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,120
God.

396
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,490
God.

397
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,960
Oh,my god.

398
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,220
Oh,my god.

399
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,220
I got you.
I got you.

400
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,460
Damn,
that dead chick can run.

401
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,700
What now?

402
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,620
I say we go have a little chat
with neal.

403
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,330
So,the silver bullets,
they did something,right?

404
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,810
Yeah,something,but not enough.
What else you got?

405
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,380
Um,okay,besides silver,

406
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,850
we have "nailing the undead
back into their grave beds."

407
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,210
It's mentioned a few times. It's probably
where the whole vampire-staking lore came from.

408
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,410
Their grave beds?
You serious?

409
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,440
Yeah.

410
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,650
How the hell are we gonna get
angela back to the cemetery?

411
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,120
What are you guys doing here?

412
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,890
You know,I've heard of some people
doing some pretty desperate things to get laid,

413
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,610
but you

414
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,790
You take the cake.

415
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,380
Okay,who are you guys?

416
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,730
You might want to ask angela
that question.

417
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,870
- What?
- We know what you did.

418
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,980
The ritual...everything.

419
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,840
You're crazy.

420
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,170
Your girlfriend's past her expiration date,
and we're crazy?

421
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,300
When someone's gone,
they should stay gone.

422
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,210
You don't mess
with that kind of stuff.

423
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,460
Angela killed matt.

424
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,400
She tried to kill lindsay.

425
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,680
I don't know
what you're talking about.

426
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,740
Hey,no more crap,neal!

427
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,210
This blood
is on your hands.

428
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,060
Now,me and him can make this right,
but you got to tell us where she is.

429
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,730
Tell us!

430
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,850
My house.

431
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,850
She's at my house.

432
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,330
You sure about that?

433
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,260
Listen. It doesn't really matter
where she is.

434
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,990
There's only one way
to stop her.

435
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,540
We've got to perform another ritual over
her grave  to reverse the one that you did.

436
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,490
We're going to need some black roots,
some scar weed,some candles.

437
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,490
It's very complicated,
but it will get the job done.

438
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,980
She'll be dead again
in a couple hours.

439
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,210
I think you should
come with us.

440
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,270
I'm serious,neal.
Leave with us right now.

441
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,960
No.

442
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
No.

443
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,550
Listen to me.

444
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,900
Get out of here
as soon as you can.

445
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,890
But most of all,be cool.
No sudden movements.

446
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,860
Don't make her mad.

447
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,270
Let's go.

448
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,740
You said
you'd stay in the house.

449
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,100
I'm sorry.
I just needed to see you.

450
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,870
Neal,please.

451
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,920
You have to help me.

452
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,240
Oh,god.

453
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,630
Come with me to the cemetery.
Neal,they're trying to kill me.

454
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,160
We have to stop them.

455
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,320
You mean kill them?

456
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,610
It's true --

457
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,630
- matt and lindsay.
- They hurt me.

458
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,420
If you love me,you'll make sure
nobody hurts me again.

459
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,830
Take me to the cemetery,
then all this will be over.

460
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,000
We can start
new lives together.

461
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,070
Okay.

462
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,970
God help me,but okay.

463
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,100
I'll go get the car.

464
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,530
Just...

465
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,700
just wait here.

466
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,980
Neal,you look nervous.

467
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,650
No,I'm fine.

468
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,950
Were you...
going to leave me?

469
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,940
No,of course not.

470
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,280
You were,weren't you?!

471
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,650
How could you?!
Neal,I loved you!

472
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,880
Angela --

473
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,190
You really think
this is gonna work?

474
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,770
No,not really.

475
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,590
But it was the only thing
I could come up with.

476
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,840
Wait.
It's not what you think.

477
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,110
I didn't ask to be brought back,
but it's still me.

478
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:51,140
I'm still a person.
Please.

479
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,140
Please don't!

480
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,470
What's dead should stay dead.

481
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,180
Rest in peace.

482
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,340
Yeah,
for good this time,okay?

483
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,460
You know,

484
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,630
the whole fake-ritual thing,

485
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:14,500
luring angela into the
cemetery -- pretty sharp.

486
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,430
Thanks.

487
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,010
But did we have to use me
as bait?

488
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,870
I figured you were more her type,you know?
She had pretty crappy taste in guys.

489
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,450
I think she broke my hand.

490
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,270
You're just too fragile.
We'll get it looked at later.

491
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,870
You want to stay
for a while?

492
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,670
No.

493
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,160
Dean,what is it?

494
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,680
I'm sorry.

495
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,160
For what?

496
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,520
The way I've been acting.

497
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,590
And for dad.

498
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,180
Well,
he was your dad,too.

499
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,770
It's my fault
that he's gone.

500
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,650
What are you
talking about?

501
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,600
I know you've been thinking it.
So have I.

502
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,960
Doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

503
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,630
Back at the hospital,
I had a full recovery.

504
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,410
It was a miracle.

505
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,170
And five minutes later,
dad's dead,and the colt's gone.

506
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,820
You can't tell me
there's not a connection there.

507
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,690
I don't know
how the demon was involved.

508
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,680
I don't know how the whole thing
went down exactly...

509
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,790
but dad's dead because of me.

510
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,410
And that much I do know.

511
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,810
We don't know that,
not for sure.

512
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,800
Sam...

513
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,080
you and dad...

514
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,300
you're the most important people
in my life.

515
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,370
And now...

516
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,340
I never should have come back,
sam. It wasn't natural.

517
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,680
And now look

00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,870
And I should have
stayed dead.

how I was feeling.

Well,that's it.

522
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,330

523
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,620
