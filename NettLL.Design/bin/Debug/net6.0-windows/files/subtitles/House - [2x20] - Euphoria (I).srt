00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,726
Hey,guys!

2
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:58,312
Guess he got away.

3
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,656
Can baby shoes come out to play?

4
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:07,994
Come on.

5
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:10,710
Hands on your head,climb out.

6
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:16,181
I can't climb out if my hands are on my head.

7
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:19,569
Just keep 'em where i can see 'em,man.

8
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,227
Go 'head. Go 'head.Come on.

9
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:30,173
You high,popo?

10
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,345
Yeah,man.

11
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,080
Catchin' morons makes me high.

12
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,207
Take your shirt off by your collar and turn around.

13
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:38,582
Whoo,would you  look at that!

14
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:41,057
Dude's got a weapon.

15
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:47,552
All right,you have the right to remain...stupid!

16
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:49,025
Watch the gun.

17
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:51,651
Anything you say will be completely incomprehensible.

18
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:52,723
Seriously,man,careful!

19
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:55,119
Seriously,man?Seriously?

20
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,604
Your mama know what you do?!

Season 2 Episode 20

24
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,040
Aww...that's sweet.

25
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,278
Your dad's proud.You made the local paper.
--From my article.

26
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:49,761
Give it a rest.

27
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:51,175
You read what he wrote in the margin?

28
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:55,194
"Our friend lazarus sleeps,but I go that i may wake him up."

29
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:57,288
He's not proud of me.He's proud of jesus.

30
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:59,002
Everything I do right is god's work.

31
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:02,108
Everything I do wrong is my own damn fault.

32
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,566
Cop with a sense of humor.

33
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:08,443
Differential diagnosis.

34
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:11,280
Guy's in the E.R.,Bleeding on everybody.

35
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,192
Drugs?

36
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:12,842
He's a cop.

37
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,530
Good point.How about...drugs?

38
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,712
Tox screen was clean.

39
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,428
He did,however,get hit by a bullet.

40
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,141
Just mentioning it.

41
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:22,093
He was shot?

42
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,239
No,somebody threw it at him.

43
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,286
I'm thinking trauma.He's got bullet fragments lodged in his brain.

44
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:30,262
According to baby shoes,the cop was laughing before he got shot.

45
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,034
Baby shoes?

46
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:32,958
--Guy who shot him.--Reliable witness.

47
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:36,797
His name is baby shoes.How bad can he be?

48
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:40,495
Fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria.

49
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:44,053
So let's expand the search.Factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.

50
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,130
Why are we ignoring the elevated heart rate?--'Cause he's in shock.

51
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,685
What if the heart was already fast before he got shot?

52
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:51,089
You mean after the foot race?

53
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,055
He's giddy.Indicates a blockage of oxygen.

54
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:56,391
Carbon monoxide gas would elevate the heart rate

55
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:58,675
and cause coughing and impair neurological functions.

56
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,540
He got co poisoning outdoors?

57
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,763
Yeah.

58
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,980
All 'cause those bastards didn't ratify kyoto.

59
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,576
Or he got co poisoning indoors

60
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:11,073
and moved outdoors before he'd inhaled enough to make him drop dead.

61
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:16,064
Test his arterial blood gas.If his carboxy hemoglobin levels are higher than 15%,

62
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:17,948
stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.

63
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:21,957
You go check the cop car for gas leaks or--

64
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:23,972
if it was the cop car,his partner would be sick.

65
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:27,059
Well,maybe she is she just doesn't have as good a sense of humor.

66
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,296
Also check his personal cars,work,home.

67
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:33,193
I'll check the precinct.

68
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:40,098
Blood tests confirm you have low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.

69
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:42,985
We're putting you inside a high-pressure chamber to...

70
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:45,590
You don't really care,do you?

71
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,154
Do you live near a gas supply?

72
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:49,780
Uh,yeah,me.

73
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,336
After,like,a huge enchilada.

74
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:57,838
Anything toxic you have at your home?

75
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:00,915
Any paint solvents,anything unhygienic?

76
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:02,668
Uh,no.

77
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,846
No,I keep a pretty clean home.

78
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,811
If you start having trouble breathing,you can press this button,

79
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:25,224
and the chamber will decompress.

80
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:26,276
Like this?

81
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:28,241
Don't now.If you have trouble.

82
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:29,964
Ah,it's broken.

83
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:32,190
All right,well,if you have problems we'll push it for you.

84
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,664
Muscle contracture.

85
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:35,928
How bad does it hurt?

86
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:37,943
Not...not at all.

87
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,887
Looks wild,though,huh?

88
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:42,592
Your brain's not getting enough oxygen.You're losing motor function.

89
00:06:42,662 --> 00:06:44,506
We should start this right away.

90
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:46,251
Should I be scared?

91
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:48,586
No,you probably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place.

92
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,921
We have a guy there checking things out.

93
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,262
Sounds okay.

94
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,876
How about the gas intake valve?

95
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:20,968
Looks great.

96
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,022
It's down in the furnace room.

97
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,676
Your system's fine.

98
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:27,734
If you had a carbon monoxide leak,half the force would be sick.

99
00:07:27,804 --> 00:07:29,548
Then why are you here?

100
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,156
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.

101
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:42,697
Yeah.I've,uh...I've got a disability.

102
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:47,979
These are speeding tickets.

103
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,365
A lot of emergencies.

104
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:54,853
He's feeling better now,but...you never know.

105
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:58,022
I'll see what we can do.

106
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,550
Where's your partner sit?

107
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,737
Place is a cesspool,but I don't think I need to test for anything.

108
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,149
Nope,waste of time.

109
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,014
You know about the marijuana?

110
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:19,038
I've heard rumors since junior high.

111
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:21,554
The cop's acting high because he is high.

112
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,307
He's got--legionnaires' disease.

113
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:25,593
It's a good thing joe got shot.

114
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:28,801
The whole precinct would have got wiped out.Anarchy on the streets.

115
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,895
Takes 48 hours to test for legionnaire'S.

116
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:32,999
And only two seconds to recognize if the symptoms fit

117
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,187
while staring at the rancid,unchanged water of an ac unit.

118
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,995
Marijuana explains the high carboxy,the cloudy lungs,and the happiness.

119
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:42,892
Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted.

120
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,395
Why don't we agree to disagree?

121
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:46,471
Actually,why don't we agree that you'll disagree with me

122
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:50,329
while treating him for legionnaire's?It's not as pithy,but...

123
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,438
I feel a lot better.The meds are working.

124
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,817
Heart rate's normal.Cohp levels are down.No fever.

125
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:01,433
Take some deep breaths.

126
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:05,492
You seem disappointed.

127
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:07,436
I'm glad you're feeling better.

128
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,150
You got a problem with cops?

129
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:10,414
Please don't talk.

130
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:13,751
In my experience,people who just don't like cops have a reason--

131
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,424
I need you not to talk.

132
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,383
No rales.

133
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:24,455
these clouded areas of the upperobes...they're the infiltrates we found yesterday.

134
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:25,638
Not there anymore?

135
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,604
They're clearing up.You had legionnaire'S.

136
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,278
Now you don'T.

137
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,759
So you didn't,um...you didn't find anything at my place?

138
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:39,038
Nothing...medically relevant.

139
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:43,286
So there's,uh...there's nothing I need to worry about,then?

140
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,132
Not this time.

141
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:50,474
Whatcha doing?

142
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:52,628
I want to make sure he sees what's involved.

143
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,834
What we found was fairly advanced.

144
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:57,729
These cloudy areas here,and here.

145
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,536
These parts of your lungs simply weren't functioning.

146
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:02,852
They're okay now,right?

147
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:07,460
Everything's okay now?

148
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,678
I'm fine.

149
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,001
You're blind.

150
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:28,418
I bumped into something.That doesn't mean I can't see.

151
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:30,483
I'm sure it's frightening,but you only think--

152
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,447
what's dr. Cameron wearing?

153
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:38,230
Dark blue pants,white shirt.Black shoes.

154
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,491
Ooh,almost.'Cept for the pants,shirt,and shoes.You're blind.

155
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:46,890
he really thinks he can see?

156
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,295
He can physically see.His brain just can't process it.

157
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:50,999
No chance this is a practical joke?

158
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,301
No way.

159
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:55,688
Anton's blindness indicates damage to both occipital lobes.

160
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,062
Must be from the trauma.

161
00:10:57,103 --> 00:11:00,028
Bullet fragments just happen to hit the same spot in both lobes?

162
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:04,428
Stroke could cause anton's blindness and euphoria.

163
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,946
Office krupke is clotting in his brain.

164
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:11,714
Start heparin to thin the blood,find the clot,and yank it out.

165
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:14,461
Clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertibral arteries.

166
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,969
Great.Chase...stick your fingers in there,grope around till you find it.

167
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,755
Oh,wait...when you turn him into a vegetable,

168
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,931
then there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits.

169
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,927
You know what would be better?Contrast mri.

170
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,301
Do we have one of those?

171
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:29,665
You can't do an mri.If the bullet fragment's magnetic,

172
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,360
they'll move and rip his brain apart.

173
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,632
Well,let's flip a coin.

174
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,536
Heads,mri;tails,he dies.

175
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:37,353
The police issue kevlar vests don't have the ceramic plate insert

176
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:39,217
that would shatter a bullet,they would just catch it.

177
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,479
So the bullet shattered on its own.

178
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:43,507
Meaning baby shoes was using 0.38 caliber hollow points.

179
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:46,884
Which,unfortunately,are ferromagnetic.

180
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,947
It's just so cool that you know that.

181
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,574
We could do an angio to find the clotting.

182
00:11:55,725 --> 00:12:00,183
Waste of time.The skull creates too much artifact.We'll never get a decent view.

183
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,679
Next best thing to an mri.--And a waste of time.

184
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,165
Angio might show--oh,god,it's a coup!

185
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:07,180
Fine!Go do your angio.

186
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,607
When you're do wasting your time,meet me down in the morgue.

187
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:16,159
we're going to snake a catheter in your femoral artery

188
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:19,137
and up into your brain so we can check for clots.

189
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,461
Keep this on throughout the procedure.

190
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,347
Unless the pot's already made you sterile.

191
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:27,395
I have a stressful job.You got no idea.

192
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:28,988
I grew up with cops like you.

193
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:31,103
One part bully,nine parts hypocrite.

194
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:40,734
what is wrong with you?

195
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,147
Just having some fun.

196
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:43,712
That man is sick and scared.

197
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:44,763
The man's a crooked cop.

198
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:46,497
Maybe you should take yourself off the case,foreman.

199
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:48,632
Don't have to like someone to be their doctor.

200
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,837
Hey,how you doing there,buddy?

201
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:55,267
Just sit still and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time.

202
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:56,910
Happy?

203
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,142
What did the angio tell us?

204
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,216
What are you looking for?

205
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:07,184
I called my mom.She didn't pick up.

206
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:09,409
What did the angio tell us?

207
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,464
That foreman should be off this case.

208
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:12,665
he's a neurologist.

209
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:15,683
Unless you think the patient's optic nerve is in his spleen...

210
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,136
he doesn't like cops.

211
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:19,742
foreman,policemen are our friends.

212
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:21,676
If you and I ever get separated shopping--

213
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,621
I was just busting the guy's chops.

214
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:25,565
See?--He was just busting the guy's chops.

215
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:28,081
Foreman is essential to solving this case.

216
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,295
Medically,what did the angio tell us?

217
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:33,252
Appears to be some clotting,possibly around the circle of willis.

218
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:36,829
Based on the progression of symptoms,the clot is growing.

219
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,903
We need to cut into--

220
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:41,440
saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam ahead.

221
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:46,371
Is it a 10-car pileup or just a really slow bus in the center lane?

222
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:50,370
And if it is a bus,is it a thrombotic bus of an embolic bus?

223
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,765
Think I pushed that metaphor too far.

224
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:54,981
Angio can't tell us that kind of information.

225
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,734
Oh,so you're saying it's just a waste of time.

226
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:59,591
It gave us some information without killing him.

227
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,425
You don't know that an mri will kill him.

228
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:03,219
The bullets have a ferrous base!

229
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,096
Little tiny pieces trapped in his head.They're not going anywhere.

230
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:09,062
maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.

231
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:12,030
Surgeons say inoperable,or the patient's on blood thinners.

232
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,522
Other than that,perfect planning.

233
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:15,005
You got a better plan?

234
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:16,569
Much.

235
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,980
Bullets identical to the one that baby shoes popped joe with.

236
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,905
Let's see how magnetic it is.

237
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:29,688
Did anybody hear a--

238
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,447
I shot him.He's dead.

239
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,436
the bullet split into four fragments,no exit wounds.

240
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,982
Only used a half load of gunpowder.

241
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:49,512
We won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an x-ray to an mri.

242
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,270
How unprofessional was foreman?

243
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,384
As him yourself.He's right here.

244
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:56,498
worse than usual.Better than you.

245
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,104
He berated joe for being a bad cop.

246
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,760
Berated or humiliated?

247
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,927
I'm not sure.I didn't have my thesaurus with me.

248
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,062
One implies that he took pleasure in it.

249
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:11,181
I wanna know if it was repressed black anger or just giddiness.

250
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,616
You think I'm sick?

251
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:15,902
I think that an appropriate response

252
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:19,370
to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.

253
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,687
But the fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.

254
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:27,347
Dr. Foreman,dr. Chase requests your assistance.

255
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,834
I can't even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.

256
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:37,881
Well,if I'd shot a live person,there's a lot more paperwork.

257
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:40,568
Then it won't be a problem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake

258
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,022
and explain why a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head?

259
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:45,116
The man donated his body to science.

260
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:48,445
Yes,it's a tragedy. If I hadn't shot him,his body could have spent the next year

261
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:51,110
letting first-year med students use the carpool lane.

262
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:51,953
He's set.

263
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,927
Do not turn that on,house.

264
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,521
You're mad because I put a bullet in his head.

265
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:58,437
At worst,all I'm doing now is taking it out.

266
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,953
My bad.

267
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:28,716
They have to,uh,shut down the magnet to fix it.

268
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:32,865
Mri is gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.

269
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:35,711
Well,it doesn't matter.

270
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,745
We obviously can't use it on this patient.

271
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:42,265
no...but there are other doctors in this hospital,and other patients.

272
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:45,382
That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment.

273
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:47,005
I'm sure i'm pulling my weight.

274
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,421
Is doing nothing an option?

275
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:54,001
I'm just saying.Maybe the clot will break up on its own.

276
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:55,655
The giddiness seems to have gone away.

277
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,149
The blindness hasn'T.

278
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,582
Echo his heart.

279
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,908
Looking for what?The problem is obviously neurological.

280
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:03,482
The clots are in his brain.The source of the clots may not be.

281
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:06,068
Do a complete transthoratic echocardiogram.

282
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:09,346
Maybe we get lucky.Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.

283
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:16,041
heart's clean.

284
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:17,684
Where else can we look?

285
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:20,361
We could ultrasound his legs,look for a dvt.

286
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:22,375
I need you to move over.

287
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,701
Joe?You okay?

288
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:27,376
Tachycardia.Heart rate 150 and rising.

289
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,821
He's bleeding out.

290
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:31,856
House wanted to thin his blood.Sure did a good job.

291
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:35,364
Bp's crashing.He's going into shock.

292
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:37,529
Intracranial bleeding.We need to relieve the pressure.

293
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,053
We need a surgical team.

294
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:43,301
Foreman,get out!

295
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,006
boy,is he screwed!

296
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:49,265
We clot his blood,he dies.We thin it,he dies.

297
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:53,374
Am I the only one who finds this funny?

298
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:00,982
Oh,man.

299
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,045
i'm not sick!

300
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:10,372
Did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain

301
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:14,522
and had to have a hole drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure?Hilarious!

302
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:17,799
Someone laughs,they're dying?That's absurd.

303
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,142
But not funny.

304
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:22,730
If I'm not sick,all you're doing is locking me up with the source.

305
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,103
I'll get sick,prove you right.

306
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:26,869
If you're not sick,it's not contagious.You've got nothing to worry about.

307
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,927
If you are sick,the two of you are staying in there until we find that why.

308
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:32,362
So you might want to make friends with the pig.

309
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,847
Good news is I can finally get my mri.

310
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:35,950
No,you can't!

311
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,824
You blew up the machine!

312
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,761
Not the portable one,chuckles.

313
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:45,581
Chase and cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.

314
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:47,255
Wh-where are you going?

315
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,701
To the office.Got work to do.

316
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,114
Eat your meals.

317
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:54,581
Take your temperature every half hour and any meds i command you to take.

318
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:56,255
So I'm just a regular patient now?

319
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,789
No.

320
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,274
You get your own thermometer.

321
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:11,579
Check your blood.

322
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:16,079
Anyone with an elevated sed rate gets to be foreman's new roomie.

323
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,984
He should be a part of this.

324
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,086
He's a patient.

325
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,770
He's not irrational.--He's not objective.

326
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:23,256
He's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.

327
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:26,183
Right,you're not even friends with him.Why would you care?

328
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:30,802
There's an area of increased t2 attenuation in the cingulate cortex.

329
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:32,386
Kind of...mushy.

330
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,500
Cingulate cortex controls emotions.

331
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:38,880
This mushy spot explains the euphoria.Question is,what's causing the mush?

332
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:41,677
Question you might want to ask a neurologist.

333
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:44,724
Foreman is a selfish jerk,but he's a neurologist,

334
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,418
and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.

335
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:48,211
This is why he shouldn't be here.

336
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:50,307
You wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here.

337
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:53,814
If you think he screwed up at that apartnt,you'd keep it to yourself.

338
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:55,598
No,I--well,we'll never know.

339
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,146
But as long as he's not here,he's just like any other patient.

340
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:01,572
Which means we can dumpn him all we want.

341
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:05,120
What's eating the selfish jerk's brain?

342
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,617
West nile or eastern equine encephalitis--test foreman's blood.

343
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,852
Given that he's the only one who got it,

344
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:12,395
person-to-person transmission is

345
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:16,645
less likely than some sort of deadly toxin foreman picked up at the guy's home.

346
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:19,622
Who wants to go next?

347
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,581
You're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy who doesn't consider you a friend.

348
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:36,760
He's just a patient,right?It's the job.

349
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:40,448
Hey...you don't have to go anywhere.

350
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,455
Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab.

351
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,871
Foreman brought back samples of everything.

352
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,005
What was that,"who wants to go next?"

353
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:50,080
Some kind of...test?

354
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,914
Don't worry.You made the right call.

355
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,580
Foreman stumbled into whatever it is without knowing.

356
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:57,287
He's way smarter than you are.

357
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,404
Damn,chase!

358
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:20,377
You suck at this.

359
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,423
Sorry,it's this damn suit.

360
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:25,610
I can do it myself.And I'll throw that out.

361
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,749
What'd the mri show?

362
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:34,670
I can't be a part of the differential,and I can't even know what the differential is?

363
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,858
You'd tell any other patient what you found out.

364
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:44,491
Mri showed a lesion on your cingulate cortex.

365
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,416
What's the thinking?

366
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:48,621
Toxins are in the lead.

367
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,285
Viral's a distant second.

368
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,169
Do you think the lesion could be an abscess?

369
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:55,256
It's just a small,soft area,more mush than--

370
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:57,732
was there inflammation in the lining of the ventricles?

371
00:21:57,842 --> 00:22:01,089
There was an increased signal there,yeah.

372
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:04,416
What are you thinking?

373
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:06,331
Staph infection.

374
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:09,679
Toxins lead to neurodegeneration,which causes the lesion.

375
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,861
Not without a fever.

376
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,354
The cop had a fever.

377
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,700
Mine could be coming.I could have got it directly from him,

378
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,563
or a dirty dish towel at his place.

379
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:20,612
Give us omaya reservoirs. Deliver linezolid directly into our brains.

380
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:22,858
And we're cured.

381
00:22:25,905 --> 00:22:28,670
samples tested negative for toluene,arsenic,and lead.

382
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:29,784
what about the blood?

383
00:22:29,854 --> 00:22:32,099
Negative for west nile and eastern equine.

384
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,003
We have to go back to joe's apartment--

385
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:37,671
no one goes back to that place till we know what we're looking for.

386
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:40,727
Get some of that cop tape.Stick it over the doors and the windows.

387
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:44,586
I'll take all the hazmat precautions.The chance of infection is next to nothing.

388
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,830
I was never that great at math.

389
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,996
But next to nothing is...higher than nothing,right?

390
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,640
It's not your fault he got sick.

391
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,684
It would be his fault if we did.

392
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:54,970
We should get a sample directly from joe's brain.

393
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,182
We can't do a biopsy.

394
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:58,999
There's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.

395
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,267
Well,I don't think this is the time to be pointing fingers.

396
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,012
I didn't give foreman any.

397
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,500
You want to give foreman a brain biopsy?

398
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,068
Come on,really,who doesn't?

399
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:18,112
This could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.

400
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:19,184
Without a fever?Not a chance.

401
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,429
Joe had a fever. --He also had legionella.

402
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,494
The mush might be forming an abscess.

403
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:26,811
And since there was inflammation of the lining of the ventricles,it makes sense.

404
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:30,480
The staph releases toxins,causes neurodegeneration,causes a lesion.

405
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,662
This is a waste of time.

406
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,070
We should put an omaya reservoir in foreman's brain and start administering anti--

407
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,488
if I'm gonna be arguing with foreman,I may as well do it directly.

408
00:23:52,107 --> 00:23:54,654
Kernig's sign,negative.

409
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,980
Brudzinski's sign,single positive.

410
00:24:06,901 --> 00:24:11,020
Patient joe luria,distal and proximal arm contractures,

411
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,124
duration four seconds.

412
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:18,427
Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.

413
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:21,092
Most commonly?

414
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,659
You wanna treat me like any other patient,do it.

415
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:27,397
But the house I know never uses phrases like "most commonly."

416
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:30,253
You're not laughing anymore.

417
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:31,647
No.

418
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:34,483
Think that's a good thing?

419
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:36,728
Sorta doubt it.

420
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:43,463
Staph would be in your heart,lungs,spleen,liver,or kidneys before it gets to your brain.

421
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:45,788
Your organs are clear.It's not staph.

422
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:48,223
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.

423
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:50,549
Which I would have seen in your mri.

424
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:55,119
Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.

425
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,739
Let me see the mri.

426
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,947
There was no abscess on the image.

427
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:04,439
Let me see it,then.

428
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:08,038
I liked you better when you were jolly.

429
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:20,005
Mri was taken over an hour ago.

430
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:22,611
That soft spot could now be an abscess.

431
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:26,329
If it was staph,you'd have a fever.Which you don't!

432
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,716
101.6.

433
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:32,082
What idiot gave you that?

434
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:36,792
Put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.

435
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:43,587
triangle.

436
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,356
this one?

437
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,165
Uh...circle.

438
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:53,539
Next.

439
00:25:54,582 --> 00:25:57,408
Foreman,why aren't you answering?Is there a problem?

440
00:25:57,478 --> 00:25:58,792
Uh,s-square.

441
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:00,416
tell me your date of birth.

442
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,981
Is that house?--yeah. Next.

443
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,865
A square again.Why is he here?

444
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:07,691
Because my neurologist is having surgery.

445
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:09,485
Thought I was just another patient.

446
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:11,389
You didn't believe that crap,did you?

447
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,643
Date of birth.

448
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:15,318
The omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.

449
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:18,816
My spatial recognition is the issue,not my memory.

450
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:20,931
Did you say omaya?

451
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,635
I could have sworn you said biopsy.

452
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,849
Hey,I'm just messing with your head.

453
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,905
Mother's maiden name,please.

454
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:30,452
Get out of my temporal lobe,house.

455
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:42,058
Hello?

456
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,598
Are you awake?

457
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:52,191
They told me somebody was sick like me.

458
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:54,135
I'm up.

459
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,836
Your voice...

460
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,922
aren't you my doctor?

461
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:05,210
Not anymore.

462
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,119
You're the guy who doesn't like cops.

463
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:12,025
Yeah.

464
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:14,802
Can you see?

465
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,207
You can't?

466
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:19,342
Not a thing.

467
00:27:23,832 --> 00:27:25,665
You've been blind a while.

468
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:27,610
The fact that you're aware of it now...

469
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,206
it could be a sign of improvement.

470
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:38,575
It hurts so much.Doesn't it?

471
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,991
I'm okay.

472
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:43,577
It's gonna hurt.

473
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,089
The morphine barely takes the edge off.

474
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:53,058
I'm gonna die,aren't I?

475
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:56,475
You die,I die.It's not gonna happen.

476
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:58,479
Why not?

477
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:02,097
You're just too stubborn to die?

478
00:28:02,177 --> 00:28:04,944
They took a piece of my brain.

479
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:10,536
Whatever's wrong with us...they'll find.

480
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,183
Do you believe in prayer?

481
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:27,023
Not really.

482
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:31,934
Neither do I.

483
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,967
My dad always prays.

484
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:41,306
So does mine.

485
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:47,911
Do you wanna try it?

486
00:28:49,224 --> 00:28:51,679
Try prayin'?

487
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:57,722
Okay.

488
00:29:14,078 --> 00:29:15,632
How is he?

489
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,537
Still dying.

490
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:22,296
Well,you've almost mastered another skill,though.That's good.

491
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:25,445
Foreman's biopsy results.

492
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:29,012
Non-specific signs of inflammation.

493
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:32,039
That's it?

494
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,208
We also swabbed for staph.Negative.He's not even a carrier.

495
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,641
Well,at least foreman was wrong too.

496
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:44,346
Yeah,there's that.

497
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:47,794
Can I go to joe's apartment now?

498
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,168
No.

499
00:29:49,238 --> 00:29:50,510
Go back to the lab.

500
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,407
Start retesting all the samples that foreman collected.

501
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:54,318
For what?

502
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:55,461
Everything.

503
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:59,169
Bacteria,toxins,fungus.Anything that likes to feast on brain.

504
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,733
That's thousands of--

505
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,066
better hurry.

506
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:04,762
Cameron,suit up.You're gonna monitor foreman.

507
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:08,771
He's on to hand contractures.He'll be in anton's blindness soon.

508
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:12,419
Run hourly checks,because when he does go blind,he won't be able to tell us.

509
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:17,260
We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind joe he is.

510
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:19,997
Why are you still here?

511
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:29,678
You're being cautious.

512
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,368
You're being...common.

513
00:30:36,453 --> 00:30:38,108
When you don't give a crap about--

514
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:41,836
how many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients?

515
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:45,504
Let me know when that happens.Then we can have this conversation.

516
00:30:46,216 --> 00:30:47,789
It's just another case,huh?

517
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:49,834
Gee,I bet you can even have unprotected sex

518
00:30:49,904 --> 00:30:52,659
with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing.

519
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,907
Boy,I wish I had your job.

520
00:31:09,598 --> 00:31:12,223
Biopsy showed nothing.

521
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:15,460
How can there be nothing?You cut out a piece of my brain.

522
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,305
It's nothing personal.We just didn't find anything.

523
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:19,549
Can you up his morphine for god's sake?

524
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,685
He's already maxed out,20 milligrams per hour.

525
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:23,207
What about toxins?

526
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:24,381
Everything was negative.

527
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:26,555
There was a cupboard above the stove.Did you see it?

528
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,602
I didn't check all the food,but could be listeriosis.

529
00:31:29,642 --> 00:31:31,285
We didn't go back.Follow right.

530
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,341
Who did?

531
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:35,625
House said we shouldn't go.Too dangerous.

532
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:38,563
The answer's gotta be in that apartment.Not going is too dangerous!

533
00:31:38,632 --> 00:31:39,514
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:41,439
You're thankful.

535
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:45,959
If house would have pointed at you instead of me,you'd be the one in here.

536
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,783
Look straight forward,tell me when you can see--

537
00:31:47,853 --> 00:31:51,150
it's your job to go back!You're a doctor!You go where the disease is!

538
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,964
Say when you can see the light.

539
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,369
I'm dying,and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?

540
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,783
Tell me when you can see the light!

541
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:57,535
My vision's fine!

542
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,288
Your left-side periphery is reduced.

543
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:01,283
It's fine,I'll prove it.

544
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,350
Ow! Son of a bitch!

545
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:09,050
Now we're both exposed.

546
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,215
You got two choices.

547
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:14,792
You can go tell house what just happened and get your own cot board in here,

548
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:16,968
or you can go back to that apartment...

549
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:22,341
you save me,the cop,and yourself.

550
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:30,529
it's not sspe.I checked your past vaccinations against joe'S.No batch matches.

551
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,325
Blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?

552
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:35,830
Guys,could you please shut him up?

553
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,076
He's over his limit on morphine.

554
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,217
Where's cameron?

555
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:42,936
She said she has some stuff to do.Said she'd be back soon.

556
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:01,327
what are you doing?

557
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,635
Foreman!

558
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:09,626
Stop!I can't take it!

559
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:15,078
Imagine being constantly reminded of the...pain you're about to be in.

560
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:18,858
I can't take it!Stop it! Stop it!Stop it,stop it.

561
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:22,164
Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!

562
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:24,429
So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.

563
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,576
Either the morphine kills him or the pain does. --You're condoning this?!

564
00:33:27,616 --> 00:33:30,473
I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.

565
00:33:32,598 --> 00:33:34,954
That'll make you feel better.

566
00:33:57,063 --> 00:34:02,124
Joe has a new symptom.Hyperalgesia.

567
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:05,912
The infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.

568
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:14,131
Make it stop!Make it stop!

569
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:19,823
His brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain,

570
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:22,861
and because of the location,the painkillers do nothing.

571
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:27,760
Suit up.Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.

572
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:02,439
What if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?

573
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,302
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.

574
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,117
Did you find any cedarwood anywhere?

575
00:35:06,197 --> 00:35:08,672
No,but maybe--maybe what?

576
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:12,120
Maybe somebody could go back,take a second look?

577
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:15,098
And why aren't you pissed off that cameron's playing hooky

578
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:17,642
while your life hangs in the balance?

579
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:47,400
Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?

580
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,635
I decided you were wrong.

581
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:52,010
God,you're weak.

582
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,954
Guy steals your article...

583
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:56,349
tells you you're not his friend...

584
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,367
and you still want to risk your life for him.

585
00:36:02,002 --> 00:36:04,858
Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.

586
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:07,064
Yeah.

587
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:11,504
God,you're weak.Guy tried to kill you.

588
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:15,754
First thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back.Shoot him.

589
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,827
I've got a gun in my desk.

590
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:20,984
Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it

591
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:23,220
and then give the bastard everything he wanted.

592
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,396
I'm not here for foreman.I'm here to save myself.

593
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:30,887
even with a needle stick,your chances of infection are pretty slim.

594
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:32,941
That's why you're wearing the suit.

595
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:34,926
You wanted to be here.

596
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:37,752
He just gave you the excuse.

597
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:42,864
What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?

598
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,051
Give me the bag.

599
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:08,140
Mildewed dish towel.--To retest for staph.

600
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,616
What is that,mouse droppings?

601
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,984
Hamster droppings.Could carry toxocara.Explain the blindness.

602
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:16,598
Now,that I recognize as oven crud.

603
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,115
Could be meat with trichinella.Would explain the high fever.

604
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:22,171
What's with rye bread?

605
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:26,862
Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning,which would explain the contractures.

606
00:37:26,932 --> 00:37:30,249
There are three loaves.--So?

607
00:37:33,226 --> 00:37:35,803
You're going back in there.

608
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:41,314
Guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.

609
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,520
That's looking too far into the future.

610
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,258
Unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.

611
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:49,583
You on the roof yet?

612
00:37:50,074 --> 00:37:53,271
Yeah,I'm here. I don't see any birds.

613
00:37:53,391 --> 00:37:55,336
Whistle or something.

614
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,942
Do that come hither thing.

615
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:13,296
they came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.

616
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:14,799
Joe's been feeding them.

617
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,505
Now look down.You see a river of pigeon turd?

618
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:21,013
Uh...no.There's barely any.

619
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,038
It's not weird,it's cheap.

620
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:25,373
Joe's a guy whlooks for the easy way.

621
00:38:25,443 --> 00:38:27,929
Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.

622
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,745
Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?

623
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:33,260
You see a shovel or a dustpan?

624
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,777
Mmm,found a scraper.Looks used.

625
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,142
Sitting on a bucket.

626
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:43,925
Bucket full of pigeon crap.Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.

627
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:45,789
Yep.

628
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:48,715
Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus,

629
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:53,435
where it dances its triple threat of happiness,blindness,and intractable pain.

630
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:56,213
Let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.

631
00:38:56,293 --> 00:39:00,432
Don't cut corners when you're growing your pot.See you back home.

632
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:01,935
I was there.

633
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:03,880
I should have found it.

634
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,227
Yeah,you could have saved us a lot of time.

635
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:10,614
Get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.

636
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:12,579
I'll start us both.

637
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:15,816
I was waiting for lab confirmation.Haven't heard from house yet.

638
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,981
Look at his eeg.

639
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:22,441
Theta band's been increasing steadily since--since we put him under.

640
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:25,017
Guy's unconscious,but still in pain.

641
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:28,144
Theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.

642
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:29,687
One of which is pain.

643
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:34,287
The fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better,not necessarily him.

644
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:43,297
Chase!How's cameron?

645
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,256
She's not giddy.

646
00:40:54,898 --> 00:40:58,476
Fever's down.White count's improving.

647
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:00,611
Has she said anything to you?

648
00:41:00,651 --> 00:41:07,125
You mean like,"I completely understand why foreman did what he did,and I hold no grudge?"

649
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:12,989
What I did...did save my life.

650
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,946
Get in here and help!Forget the suit!

651
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:28,524
He's tachycardic!Wide-complex looks like v-tach!

652
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:30,929
It's not cryptococcus!

653
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,984
What?--House was wrong.The samples were negative.

654
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:33,685
So what is it?

655
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:35,207
We don't know!--Give him in the amio.

656
00:41:35,248 --> 00:41:36,662
Do we have any more leads?

657
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:38,485
that was our lead!Foreman!

658
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:40,209
So the treatment isn't doing anything.

659
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,574
Foreman!He's in v-fib!

660
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,683
No good.Hit him again.

661
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:52,638
Come on,man.Come on,joe.

662
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,942
Hit him again!

663
00:41:59,362 --> 00:42:01,577
give him an amp of epi!

664
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,135
Nothing!

665
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:14,616
He's has multiple-system failure.

666
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:20,048
Foreman.

667
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,263
Come on,joe.

668
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:27,114
Foreman.

669
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:33,018
foreman!Time of death.

670
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:34,721
No.

671
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:43,781
Time of death.

672
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:52,110
12:26 pm.
