192
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,151
pam.

193
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,921
"beverly,do you have any idea !

any history of chemical dependency?

196
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:05,141
no,of course not.

197
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:07,141
"i don't know why.

198
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:16,411
one minute,they were my husband and my son,and the next,they had the devil in them.

199
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:20,881
we've got to talk.

200
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:28,989
those guys were whackedout ofofheir gourds.

201
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:32,212
what do you think,"mass possession?

202
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,125
if it is a possession,there could be more.

203
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,117
god knows how many.

204
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:37,159
"it could be likea freaking shriner convention.

205
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,783
of course,that's one wayto wipe out a town -- !

206
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:41,705
you take it "from the inside.

207
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:45,729
"we didn't see any "of the demon smoke with tanner or any of the other usual signs.

208
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:48,492
something g rned him into a monster.

209
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:52,027
you know,if you would have taken out the other one,!

210
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:53,228
there would be one less to worry about.

211
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:54,639
i'm sorry.

212
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,450
i hesitated.

213
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,402
it was a kid.

214
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:58,074
no,it was an "it."

215
00:11:58,074 --> 00:12:00,496
it's not the best time "for a bleeding heart,sam!

216
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:02,699
how's the patient?

217
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,400
terrible.

218
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:04,522
what the hellhappened out there?

219
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:05,292
We don't know.

220
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:07,305
you just killed "my next-door neighbor.

221
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:08,095
we didn't have a choice.

222
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:08,906
"maybe so,!

223
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:11,149
but we need the county sheriff. I need the corner

224
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,830
the phones are down.

225
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,022

227
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:17,647
yeah,we do,but it crapped outjust like e erything else.

228
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,320
i don't understand what is hahaening.

229
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,521
how far is it "to the next town?

230
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:22,703
it's about 40 miles down to sidewinder.

231
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:24,786
i'm gonna go down thereand see if i can find some help.

232
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,450
"my partner will stick aroundand keep you guys safe.

233
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,542

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,090
his lymphocyte percentage is pretty high.

237
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:07,883
his body was fighting off a viral infection.

238
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:08,912
really?

239
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:10,358
wh kind of virus?

240
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,745
i can't say for sure.

241
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:13,933
an infection could have made h h act like that?

242
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:18,725
some can cause dementia,"but not that kind of violence.

243
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:21,647
and besides,s,i've never heard of one that did this to the blood.

244
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:22,538
"did what?

245
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:24,795
there's thth weird residue.

00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:27,013
if i didn't know better,!

247
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,816
i'd say it was sulfur.

248
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:36,906
sulfur.

249
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,198

really?

341
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:39,219
and i think the infected are trying to infect otherswith blood-to-blood contact.

342
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:43,199
Oh, I guess this better, the virus leaves traces of sulfur in the blood.

343
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,573
a demonic virus?

344
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,639
"more like demonic germ warfare.

345
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:49,797
at least it explains why i've been having visions.

346
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,884

guy shows up out of nowhere,cut on his leg,"his whole familyis infected.

453
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:33,334
we should keep him tied up,and we should wait and see

For what? for him to hulk out,infect somebody else?

455
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:38,142
