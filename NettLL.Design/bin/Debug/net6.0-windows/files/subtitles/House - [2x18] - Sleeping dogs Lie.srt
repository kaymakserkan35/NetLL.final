1
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,918
Hannah,you okay?

2
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,725
Still can't sleep?

3
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:52,790
I'm fine.

4
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,880
Can I do anything to help you?

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,275
Just go back to sleep.I wanna go get a glass of wine.

6
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:00,538
I can keep you company.

7
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:01,802
You have work in the morning.

8
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,436
Are you sure,you don't want me to...

9
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:06,482
I'll be right back.Just sleep.

10
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:17,990
Hannah?

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,273
Hannah?

12
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:36,796
What'd you do?

13
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:39,723
I just wanted to sleep.

14
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,419
I'm calling an ambulance.

15
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:37,412
You've seen one patient in the last two hours.

16
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,398
Complicated case.

17
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:40,991
I'm a night owl.

18
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:44,550
Wilson's an early bird.We're different species.

19
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,893
Then move him into his own cage.

20
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:48,439
Who'll clean the droppings from mine?

21
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,870
25-year-old female with sleep issues.

22
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,700
I'm guessing she'S...oh,what's the medical term...

23
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,684
upset.

24
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:04,057
25-year-old females,they're usually completely rational,they're rocks,really.

25
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,140
my theory seems to be supported by the fact that she swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills.

26
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,006
Get her a shrink.I need some shut-eye.

27
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:14,774
She's a little bit more than upset.

28
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:17,169
She hasn't slept in ten days.

29
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:18,301
She's lying.

30
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:22,191
Without rem sleep your neurons stop regenerating.

31
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:24,376
Your brain shuts down,lobe by lobe.

32
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:27,885
She'd be insane after five days,dead by ten.

33
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:31,283
Give me a little credit.I know what gets you off.

34
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:34,180
She took the pills to sleep,not to kill herself.

35
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,553
Clever alibi.

36
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:36,455
They didn't work.

37
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:40,385
She stayed awake even though she downed the whole bottle.

38
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:47,593
And the longest anyone's ever survived without sleep is 11 days.

39
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:50,861
Which gives you about 22 hours.

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,274
You stole my article.

41
00:03:56,314 --> 00:03:57,537
I wouldn't do that.

42
00:03:57,577 --> 00:04:01,075
I wrote up the case where we induced hypothermic cardiac arrest in the terminal cancer girl.

43
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:03,020
I wrote my own.I didn't steal yours.

44
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,666
You knew I was writing one.You gave me notes.

45
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:08,383
Got a case.

46
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:11,350
It can wait.You two finish.

47
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,468
Five bucks says someone loses an eye.

48
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,277
Fine.You're only putting off the inevitable.

49
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:21,846
25-year-old female,hasn't slept for ten days.

50
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,983
I assume the er tried giving her some sedatives.We should up the dosage.

51
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:26,627
Sedation isn't the same as sleep.

52
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:27,610
Thanks for your insight.

53
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,817
For someone who hasn't slept in ten days,sedation is a great start.

54
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,020
Sleep is an active process--

55
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,316
reboots the system,restores the brain.Sedatives don't--

56
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:36,471
the brain is being stressed;we need to relieve that.

57
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,807
You've had my article on your desk for the last four months.

58
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:43,407
I'm a very slow reader.No fever,no white count means no infection.

59
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:44,741
Schizophrenia?

60
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:47,738
No delusions.--You read his.

61
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,773
Signed it,didn't read it.

62
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:53,241
Aside from the sleeping pills,tox screen was clean.

63
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:56,248
No cocaine,methamphetamines,or diet pills.

64
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:59,988
Only medications she's had recently are steroids for poison ivy

65
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:02,453
and ibuofen for a knee she hurt skiing.

66
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:05,742
Nothing that would cause sleep disturbances.When did you get his article?

67
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,826
about three weeks ago.

68
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,912
Let's go back to the beginning.

69
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,275
How far back?

70
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:12,899
Genesis.

71
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:17,129
God said let there be light.

72
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,876
Sleep is initially controlled by external light cues.

73
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:24,527
And if her brain can't interpret those cues...optic nerve disease.

74
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:27,505
I'm sensing another article.

75
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:30,040
I'll go run the tests.

76
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:37,167
I'm injecting a dye which will allow us to take a look at your retina and your optic nerve.

77
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:38,993
Everything's kinda blurry.

78
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:42,681
Normal,because of the dye.It's gonna be that way the next few hours.

79
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,028
Need a hand?

80
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,362
No.

81
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:53,968
We're never going to work together again?

82
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:57,277
Just don't see the need to make you feel better by forgiving you.

83
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:00,835
I wasn't asking for forgiveness.I was asking if you needed help.

84
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,271
It's unprofessional to be talking about this in front of the patient.

85
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:05,486
Maybe that doesn't matter to you,but...

86
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,326
doesn't matter.She's not listening.

87
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:11,280
She's asleep.

88
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:14,087
Normal stage one brain waves.

89
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,656
Maybe she'S...better?

90
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,425
Still blurry.

91
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:23,309
You fell asleep.

92
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,675
No,I didn'T.

93
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:29,003
Negative for optic nerve disease.

94
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,326
But she sleeps.

95
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:33,083
For like ten seconds,maximum one minute.

96
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:36,411
We also checked the ocular pressure.It's normal.

97
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,646
And she doesn't know she sleeps.

98
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:41,233
Brain is often unaware of stage one sleep.

99
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:45,382
Ct showed no tumors,no clots,no seizure disorder.

100
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:49,974
So she sleeps,she just can't stay asleep.

101
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,220
You going somewhere with this?

102
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,984
You know what keeps me awake at night?

103
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,128
Monsters in the closet.

104
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,515
There's no monster in the closet.We looked.

105
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:01,271
Well,it's certainly not showing up on the scans.

106
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:03,466
Where's cameron?

107
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:07,977
She felt I could deliver the news on my own.

108
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,927
Oh,this is going to work out great.

109
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,295
Come on.

110
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:21,710
If you two guys can't play nice together,I'm taking away your toys.

111
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,615
I don't care whose fault this is.

112
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:26,502
If you hadn't--especially don't care if it was my fault.

113
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:31,725
Whatever this woman has it's not showing up on our tests,which means she's sick.

114
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,482
Just not sick enough for us to see it.

115
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:36,266
You want us to make her sicker?

116
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:40,747
yes. I want to stress her body.Specifically her brain.

117
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:42,441
Keep her awake.

118
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:46,039
Depriving her of even the few minutes of sleep she does have--it's torture.

119
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,205
So is cutting people with knives,

120
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:50,660
but you can totally get away with that if you have a doctor coat on.

121
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,909
House,those few seconds of sleep are maybe the only reason she's still alive.

122
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:56,224
The more symptoms we can force out of her,the more tests we can do.

123
00:07:56,324 --> 00:08:00,434
The more tests we do,the more information we get,the quicker we make a diagnosis.

124
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:03,161
See how much more fun it is when you guys get along?

125
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:07,070
You two take the first four hours.

126
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,917
Hannah.

127
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,356
Hannah!

128
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,342
You fell asleep.

129
00:08:20,463 --> 00:08:22,598
No,I didn'T.

130
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,645
Your brain doesn't remember,it was just a few seconds.

131
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,908
Is this really necessary?

132
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:30,678
The sooner we find out what's wrong,the sooner she can get a real night's rest.

133
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,812
Hannah?

134
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,306
Hannah?

135
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:36,191
Hannah?

136
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,206
What did you do that for?

137
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:43,478
You fell asleep again.

138
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,581
No,I didn'T.

139
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:47,178
we're sorry.We have to do this.

140
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:49,503
We don't have to be cruel.

141
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,299
You know what happens when you're nice.Nothing.

142
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,966
That's how you define nice?Not stealing?

143
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:56,039
Doctors?

144
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,147
she fall asleep again?

145
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,990
We've got rectal bleeding.

146
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,553
What,all of you?

147
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:23,315
So the monster is peeking out from under the bed.

148
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:27,705
Which either means she has a clotting disorder or she has a tumor in her colon.

149
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:29,380
we'll do a colonoscopy.

150
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,445
Who's keeping her awake now?

151
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:34,642
We figured once we found another symptom,it really didn't matter.

152
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,246
Yeah,he's got all the ideas.

153
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,359
Who is with her?

154
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:40,025
Her partner's donating blood,so she's with a nurse.

155
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:43,534
Probably singing her lullabies.I want her awake.

156
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:45,899
You have to sedate a patient to do a colonoscopy.

157
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:48,235
Why? Just because of the pain?

158
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:52,385
You find a tumor in her colon,you can knock her out.If you don't,

159
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:54,571
she stays awake.

160
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:59,813
Oh,god!It hurts!

161
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:00,786
Can't you hurry?

162
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,131
Trust me,you don't want me to hurry.

163
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,978
God,you're killing me.

164
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,003
Hold my hand.

165
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:11,562
Keep breathing,nice and steady.

166
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:15,361
How am I supposed to work with him?

167
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:19,621
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this right now?

168
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:21,886
You think i'm overreacting?

169
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:26,287
I need you to relax your anus.

170
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:30,508
We're not here.We're skiing.

171
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:33,063
It's thanksgiving,at vail.

172
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,951
You want me to think about nearly killing myself on a snowboard?

173
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,888
Come on,you never fell.

174
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,016
You were awesome.

175
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:47,548
Is that what you told him?I'm hysterical,and I need to relax my anus?

176
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:52,240
I told him--how many cases do we work up in a year?

177
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,927
They're all weird;he could've written up any one of them.

178
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:57,011
She's bleeding.

179
00:10:58,435 --> 00:10:59,617
I can't breathe.I can't breathe!

180
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,442
Hold on.

181
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,205
to control the bleed and started transfusing two units of whole blood.

182
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:14,784
The pathology from the rectal bleed showed traces of nasal epithelium.

183
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:16,889
So,the butt bleed's just a nose bleed.

184
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:19,306
That much blood is not a "just a" anything.

185
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:23,305
When two people fight this much,you know what it means.

186
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:27,255
It's gotta be a massive sinus hemorrhage that was draining down her throat and out the back.

187
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,009
The question isn't what,it's why.

188
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,353
Oh,get a room.

189
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,642
Rat poison mixed with some sort of neurogenic toxin could cause bleeding and sleep disturbances.

190
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:36,477
Do you have a specific type of neurogenic toxin in mind,

191
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:39,073
or should we just start running a thousand different tox screens?

192
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:41,018
Just pretend I'm not here.I'll be reading.

193
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,003
It could also be some type of coagulopathy.

194
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,489
Or it could be us.Do you have any idea what it feels like

195
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:48,126
to have a six-foot-long hose shoved into your large intestine?

196
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,872
No,but I now have a much greater respect for

197
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:53,869
whichever basketball player you dated in college.

198
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,117
We've basically been torturing this girl for the last eight hours.

199
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:59,442
We've been poking her foot,not punching her face.

200
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:02,761
Extreme stress can cause high blood pressure,which can cause bleeding.

201
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:04,324
Wouldn't keep her awake for ten days.

202
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:08,264
What if the poison ivy wasn poison ivy?

203
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:10,569
She got the rash

204
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,509
that was diagnosed as poison ivy around the same time the insomnia started.

205
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:19,571
Rash,plus nose bleed,plus sleep disturbance equals wegener's granulomatosis.

206
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:21,917
Start corticosteroid treatment.

207
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,791
The poison ivy treatment was steroids.

208
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:26,999
Much lower dosage.Get her back on the juice,triple the dose.

209
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,092
Get a c-anca and an upper airway biopsy to confirm the wegener'S.

210
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:49,183
She has,menstrual problems.They're really bad,the pain keeps her in bed all day.

211
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:52,611
Plus,she's super depressed.

212
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,487
She said super depressed?

213
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:03,758
She heard that birth control pills can make her feel better.

214
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:07,888
She wants birth control pills for her pms?

215
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:09,382
I guess.

216
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:13,532
Judging by the redness around your mom's nostrils,

217
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:16,358
and the tissue she's got conveniently stashed inside her wrist band,

218
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,318
I'd say her problem is more likely a uri than a pms.

219
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,732
Uri?

220
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,538
Upper respiratory infection.A cold.

221
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,403
I don't think so.

222
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,859
I also think she's got a problem with sac.

223
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:29,931
Sac?

224
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:33,721
Thanks for playing.Stupid american child.

225
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:35,414
If you want the pill,

226
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:40,347
all you have to do is to walk into any health clinic in jersey alone and ask for it.

227
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:42,962
What exactly was your plan?

228
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:45,459
Were you going to exchange the birth control pills for some

229
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:49,770
over-the-counter decongestants and hope that your mom's cold lasts another six years?

230
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,013
No.

231
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,320
That for her cold?

232
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,857
No,that's for your ovaries.

233
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,435
I assume you haven't had a stroke.Have you ever had a blood clot?

234
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:01,759
No.

235
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:02,992
Super.

236
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:06,219
In three months when you need a refill,take a bus to a free clinic.

237
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,688
Don't wait around hoping for mom to get another sniffle.

238
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:14,490
Not the sharpest chopstick in the drawer,is she?

239
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,837
Was this just one of your experiments?

240
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,975
You just wanted to see how I'd react to being screwed over by foreman?

241
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,721
Nice idea,but no.

242
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:26,940
This was just good old-fashioned laziness.

243
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,114
Gotta hand it to foreman,though.

244
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,741
He knew that you're a suck-up and I don't give a crap.

245
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,047
He successfully exploited us both.

246
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:35,961
Right.We're both victims.

247
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,057
A simple heads up,that's all I needed.

248
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,795
Maybe between your incredibly witty remarks about anal sex and cuddy's breasts,

249
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:43,198
you could've tipped me off.

250
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,254
Then I'd have foreman pissed at me,

251
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,168
and as annoying as you could be,

252
00:14:47,228 --> 00:14:50,006
at least I know you're not gonna pop a cap in my ass.

253
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:52,231
Witty,huh?

254
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:56,992
You,on the other hand,

255
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:02,416
continue to be flabbergasted every time someone actually acts like a human being.

256
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:05,843
Foreman did what he did because it worked out best that way for him.

257
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:07,849
That's what everyone does.

258
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,944
That is not the definition of being human.

259
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:13,010
That's the definition of being an ass.

260
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,115
This will numb you up.

261
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:25,230
And this will keep your tongue out of the way.

262
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:29,581
Don't worry,you shouldn't feel anything except for a slight pulling.

263
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,395
So you think I was out of line?

264
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:35,014
That article would've sat on house's desk for the next six years.

265
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:36,888
I could've told her.

266
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,355
You could've written it for her too.

267
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:41,419
She knows house as well as any of us.

268
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,359
She should've known she was waiting for him to do something he was never gonna do.

269
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,482
Chase?

270
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:54,701
Hannah?You still with us?

271
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:57,028
What's wrong with her eyes?--Looks like rem.

272
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,401
What's that?

273
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:00,856
Rapid eye movements.It's what your eyes do when you're sleeping.

274
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:02,301
But she's awake.

275
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:03,162
Hannah.

276
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,187
Hannah,can you hear me?

277
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,596
Yeah,of course.

278
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:11,362
Was she sitting up or lying down?

279
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:13,497
Sitting up.--Then it wasn't rem.

280
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:15,713
Chase says her eyes were moving the exact way--

281
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:17,066
did you start her on the steroids?

282
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:18,479
Not yet,we were still doing the--

283
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,922
then she wasn't sleeping. --How do you know?

284
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,727
'Cause we haven't done anything yet.

285
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,782
She may be able to sleep with her eyes open

286
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:27,281
but unless you also discovered she's got two extra teats and hooves for feet

287
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:31,220
there's no way she'd be able to maintain enough muscle tensity during rem sleep to sit upright.

288
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,019
It's a movement disorder,which rules out wegener'S.

289
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,883
Where's foreman?

290
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:38,417
Keeping her awake.

291
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:39,160
Good.

292
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,998
Rabies could cause muscle spasms,malaise,anxiety,and wakefulness.

293
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:45,284
Pretty unlikely she'd forget being bitten by a crazed animal.

294
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,948
She could've been exposed through an open wound.

295
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:48,091
She have a dog?

296
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:51,149
For less than a week.She had an allergic reaction,so they had to give it away.

297
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:51,860
Allergies.

298
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,697
Animal allergies seemed unlikely but it's possible that--

299
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,661
when? --When what?

300
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,486
When did she get rid of the dog?

301
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:01,924
About a month ago.Her girlfriend gave it to her for her birthday.

302
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,441
Well,then it's not allergies.

303
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,157
She's just leaving her girlfriend.

304
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,728
You...spoke to the dog?

305
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:15,918
If her birthday was a month ago,she would've still been on steroids for the poison ivy.

306
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,965
Those meds would've suppressed any reaction she might've had to the dog.

307
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,081
Which means she lied about being allergic.

308
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,043
Dog's a commitment.

309
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:25,070
You pretend to be allergic because you don't want to tell your girlfriend

310
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,116
that you're not planning on being around that long.

311
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:29,742
So I tnk we can move on to options other than allergies.

312
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:33,170
We should still do a scratch test.If she's allergic to one thing--

313
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,305
she is not allergic.

314
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:38,623
Okay,well,we could either base our diagnosis on

315
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:40,909
your admittedly keen understanding of lesbian relationships,

316
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:44,156
or we could do a scratch test.

317
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:48,557
Do a scratch test.

318
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,704
You still feeling a lot of blood in your throat?

319
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,650
No,it's actually getting a little better.

320
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,356
Good,maybe things are just starting to improve on their own.

321
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:02,490
Just a few more.

322
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:04,726
You want some water to wash out your mouth?

323
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:05,558
No,I'm okay.

324
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,254
Come on,that can't taste good.I'm going to get you a soda--

325
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:10,180
it's okay,isn't it?

326
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,798
You and max seem to have a really nice relationship.

327
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,236
She's very supportive.

328
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:29,316
When max got you the dog,did you lie about having an allergic reaction?

329
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:34,889
No. Why?

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,385
If you have pre-existing conditions,it's important we know.

331
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:40,523
But if you don't,it's just as important.

332
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:45,204
If I'm wasting my time --you're not going to tell her,are you?

333
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:48,362
It's none of my business.

334
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:50,156
She's a good person.

335
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:53,134
We've just been together so long,I...

336
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,266
I'm tired of her.

337
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:05,113
Sounds terrible,doesn't it?

338
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:08,390
I guess it happens sometimes.

339
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:11,628
My back hurts.

340
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,297
Hannah,can you turn over?

341
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,670
What's wrong?

342
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,876
I'm not sure.

343
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,582
Oh,my God.

344
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:33,360
She has massive internal bleeding.

345
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,764
Did she have access to aspirin?

346
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:36,168
She'd have to take a hell of a lot.

347
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:38,864
Why not,considering her current mental state.

348
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:41,390
What about her mental state?

349
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,377
You were right about her wanting to break up.

350
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,954
That just means I was right,doesn't mean she's suicidal.

351
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,389
Bottle of pills is what landed her here in the first place.

352
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,762
Sleeping pills.

353
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:53,329
God knows why she'd want them.

354
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,228
What else can cause sleep disorder and internal bleeding?

355
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:59,935
Drugs or alcohol can mess with the sleeping and compromise the liver.

356
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:03,102
What are you doing here?Who's keeping her awake?

357
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:04,285
Doesn't matter.

358
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:06,611
Liver function tests are through the sky.

359
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:09,227
Liver's not compromised,it's dead.

360
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,926
She doesn't need a diagnosis,she needs a new liver.

361
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:16,946
She's not getting a new liver unless we can figure out what's wrong with her.

362
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:20,885
Test for cirrhosis: 12 hours.Test for hepatitis: 8.Her liver's not gonna last another six.

363
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,101
So your advice is we just give up.

364
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,878
My advice is that we narrow our focus to conditions that

365
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,477
we can diagnose,treat,and cure in less than six hours.

366
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:32,413
And there's nothing on that list.

367
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:36,804
The girlfriend donated blood,right?

368
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:38,488
Yeah,so?

369
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:41,215
It means that they're the same type.

370
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:45,595
You can't ask the person she's about to dump to donate half her liver.

371
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,272
It does seem tacky,doesn't it?

372
00:20:56,632 --> 00:21:01,704
I'm dr. House.I'm in charge of your case.

373
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:03,488
What's going on?

374
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,965
How come no one is keeping her awake anymore?

375
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:09,122
You're in acute liver failure.

376
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:13,272
We can continue the transfusions and the lactulose,

377
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:15,257
but it's only a stopgap.

378
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:20,780
There's really nothing we can do to stop the toxins from building up in your bloodstream.

379
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:23,778
Which means that in a few hours

380
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:26,725
you will lapse into a coma...

381
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:30,484
and you won't wake up.

382
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,170
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:41,782
That's it?You're giving up?

384
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:44,869
You're not going to try to figure out what's doing this to her?

385
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:49,260
Even with the right diagnosis,any treatment'sgonna take longer than the time she has left.

386
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,036
If it's her liver,can't she get a transplant?

387
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:54,703
Wouldn't work without a diagnosis.

388
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:58,020
Whatever killed the first liver would do the same to the second.

389
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:04,386
But it would give you more time to make the diagnosis,to get her better.

390
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,887
Well,it might give us an extra day or two,but...

391
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:13,458
no procurement agency is going to let a liver go to a patient with an undiagnosed,pre-existing--

392
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:16,635
hannah and I have the samelood type.

393
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:19,613
Couldn't I be the donor?

394
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:30,259
It is medically possible for us to take a part of your--

395
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,586
please,I don't care about the risks.

396
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:46,357
You're very lucky to have such a devoted partner.

397
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:04,391
i just bought us 36 hours.Differential diagnosis:

398
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:08,812
Which monster eats your liver,screws up your sleep,and causes bleeding.

399
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:10,385
Does max know hannah plans to leave her?

400
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,371
Didn't come up.So I guess...no.

401
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:14,466
If she knew,there's no way she'd go through with this.

402
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:18,125
And if you didn't have pathological need to create a close personal relationship

403
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:21,262
with every dying person you meet,we would be blissfully ignorant of

404
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:24,200
any ethical dilemmas and might be able to actually concentrate on the differential.

405
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,523
Scratch test was negative.--

406
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:29,762
It's rare,but any of the hepatitis viruses could cause sleep disturbances and liver failure.

407
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,439
No,pcrs were normal.--We have an ethical dilemma.

408
00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:33,622
No,we don'T.

409
00:23:33,652 --> 00:23:35,185
Continue.

410
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:39,586
what about splenic cancer or non-hodgkin's lymphoma?She's the right age.

411
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,230
Could explain the bleeding.

412
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,564
Maybe the liver failure.

413
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,801
We're withholding information relevant to her decision to risk her life.

414
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:48,066
How is that not an ethical dilemma?

415
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:49,821
It's not medical information.

416
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:51,615
Who cares?--The ama.

417
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:55,054
Wilson's disease could explain the liver and neurological symptoms.

418
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:56,698
It also causes eeding disorders.

419
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,612
No kayser-fleischer rings in her eyes.

420
00:23:58,682 --> 00:24:00,858
Rings don't have to be there if there's neurological symptoms.

421
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:02,031
This is immoral.

422
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,474
Look,let's say you're right.

423
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:07,675
We tell,she changes her mind,our patient dies.How is that moral?

424
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:09,438
What else?

425
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,900
Poison mushrooms can cause liver failure,sleep disturbances,and internal bleeding.

426
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,265
She's not 'shrooming;she's a sport's nut.

427
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,229
Right.Skiers never party.

428
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,716
She's doing this out of love,and max doesn't know--

429
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:23,552
it's only moral to save a person if they love you?

430
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:26,370
It's kind of a selfish way of looking at life.

431
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,988
I like wilson's disease,like cancer,love mushrooms.

432
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,963
Yeah,but we don't have the time to test for any of it.

433
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,551
Before she can get the transplant,we need to do about 80 procedures.

434
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:37,978
So do those tests and my tests at the same time.

435
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:41,867
Use the pet to look for cancer and wilson's while you endoscope her bile ducts,

436
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:44,844
scrape her stomach for mushroom spores.One of you ct her liver,

437
00:24:44,924 --> 00:24:49,335
while the other two check proteins ca-125 and ca-19.5.

438
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:54,487
Oh yeah,anyone says anything to max,they're fired.

439
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,082
We have to.

440
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:58,056
We have to not.

441
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,469
Because she's not our patient.

442
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:03,008
She's getting surgery,she's someone's patient.

443
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:07,620
Calvin and sam.Great,thank you.

444
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,454
Need a little help.

445
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:13,123
Inexplicable rash on a patient's scrotum you need me to look at?

446
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:17,473
27-year-old female wants to donate half her liver to her dying girlfriend.

447
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:18,676
That's very generous.

448
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:21,463
This is sleepless girl?What's she got?

449
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:22,886
Liver failure.

450
00:25:22,946 --> 00:25:26,325
Sort of figured that out when you said she needed a new liver.

451
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,504
You don't have a diagnosis.

452
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:32,530
Transplant buys me time.

453
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,256
Let's just skip the part where I say this is insane.

454
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:38,865
It was her idea. --If she wants to be an idiot,it's her call.You don't need me.

455
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:41,481
Just have one of your team walk her through the process.

456
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:44,840
The donor and the donee sort of have opposing interests,right?

457
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,383
You can't really advise them both.

458
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,631
You're concerned about the ethics of this?

459
00:25:49,902 --> 00:25:52,187
What's going on?What do you know?

460
00:25:52,257 --> 00:25:53,951
Nothing medically relevant.

461
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:57,009
But you know something,and it is relevant.

462
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,332
If I can't tell her,I can't really tell you,can I?Not ifou're advising her.

463
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:05,389
I assume this information is in the medical file.

464
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:07,283
My patient's confidential file.

465
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:09,609
This hospital's file.

466
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:15,444
You can either satisfy your curiosity,or you can remain ignorant,

467
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:20,596
do nothing ethically wrong,and my patient doesn't die in three hours.

468
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:32,445
These tests and the counseling normally happen over weeks.

469
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:34,509
Sometimes months.

470
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,334
It's okay.

471
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:40,033
The most important part we're skipping is time--

472
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:42,358
time for you to change your mind.

473
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,564
I don't want to change my mind.

474
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:50,549
Not now,but with time and perspective,maybe we learn things--

475
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:52,693
if we had the time,we'd take the time,but we don'T.

476
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:55,249
So can you get this over with?

477
00:26:57,024 --> 00:27:01,595
Either I sign off on this,or it doesn't happen.

478
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:04,021
So I need you to listen to me.

479
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:08,632
Because there's a chance that you will die on that table.

480
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:19,538
I just want me and hannah to be able to lie in bed together,

481
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:25,282
as old ladies.Compare scars.

482
00:27:33,573 --> 00:27:37,161
I need you to lie on your side,and hold your knees.

483
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:45,902
I'm gonna check for vascular abnormalities that might prevent us from doing the transplant.

484
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:50,312
At the same time i'm also checking for mushroom spores to see if that's the underlying--

485
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:51,265
I don't do mushrooms.

486
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,523
You lie about your love life,maybe you lie about drugs.Open.

487
00:27:57,952 --> 00:28:00,748
Aren't you at all concerned about what max is going through right now?

488
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:02,683
They're shoving a tube up her rectum.

489
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:05,029
They're gonna swab her stomach,just like I'm doing.

490
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,364
It's going to hurt,just like this hurts.

491
00:28:07,564 --> 00:28:12,867
Which is nothing at all like the risk she's taking on the table.

492
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,509
You really don't love her,do you?

493
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:19,804
I'm not leaving her because I don't--

494
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm not talking about the leaving.I'm talking about this.

495
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,059
If you care for her at all,you won't let her do this blind.

496
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:32,264
You'd really tell.

497
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,815
You'd die.

498
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,411
Take it you've seen that.

499
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:54,749
Seen it,digested it,watched it blow up my entire department.

500
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:56,533
You read cameron's version?

501
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:57,636
Didn't read either.

502
00:28:57,716 --> 00:28:59,089
It was good.

503
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,693
Better than foreman's?

504
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:05,395
Maybe.He was more analytical about the diagnostic procedures.

505
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:09,334
She concentrated more on the ethical dilemmas of informed consent.

506
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:12,081
How any patient can really be informed without a medical degree.

507
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:14,225
Same old party lines.

508
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:16,101
Foreman should've told her.

509
00:29:16,181 --> 00:29:18,055
Oh,shoulda woulda coulda.

510
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:22,306
If you allow this sort of thing in your department,you're basically saying it's okay.

511
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,811
No,I'm saying that I don't care at they do

512
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:28,410
as long as my life isn't interrupted by pointless conversations like this one.

513
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:30,896
They won't trust each other,and they won't trust you.

514
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:32,550
They shouldn'T.

515
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:38,574
Deception like this is just one step removed from actively sabotaging one another.

516
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:40,239
Then what would you do?

517
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,476
I could be the kindest,gentlest boss in the world

518
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:46,564
and foreman would've still done what he did because that's who he is.

519
00:29:46,604 --> 00:29:49,772
We can only hope that cameron has learned something.

520
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:53,962
Right,because you're all about the teaching.

521
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:57,420
Our children are the future.

522
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:07,084
Cuddy cleared max for surgery.She's okay to go.

523
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:08,236
How's our patient?

524
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:09,329
She's also cleared.

525
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:12,537
I don't care about the prep.I care about the diagnostic tests.

526
00:30:12,617 --> 00:30:15,123
Well,it looks negative for wilson's disease,we'll know for sure in an hour.

527
00:30:15,203 --> 00:30:17,319
Blood proteins are normal,it's not--where's cameron?

528
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:19,624
Taking a sample of the bile duct.

529
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:22,822
Surgeries are supposed to start in about 15 minutes.

530
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,446
She had a chance to get one last--

531
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:25,949
hannah and max will be in the same room.

532
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:28,015
You wanted us to do as much as we can before--

533
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:31,503
they're both awake.With cameron.

534
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:38,790
Maybe we should give these two a minute together before the surgery.

535
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:41,437
You ready,honey?

536
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:46,459
Max.It's okay.

537
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,213
I'm right here.

538
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:50,478
I need you to know something.

539
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,957
I know.I love you,too.

540
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,054
I don't know how to say this.

541
00:30:57,124 --> 00:30:57,896
Good lord.

542
00:30:57,967 --> 00:30:59,491
You can tell me anything.

543
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,365
She hasn't slept in eleven days,

544
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,841
you people trying to torture her?

545
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:10,908
Ding,ding,let's go.

546
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:17,865
I told you not--I didn't say a word to max.

547
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:20,451
This is exactly why you got screwed with foreman.

548
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:22,617
You're looking for people to do the right thing.

549
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:26,536
She hasn't slept,her judgment's compromised due to inactivity in her prefrontal cortex.

550
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:30,566
Oh,she could have the best prefrontal cortex in the history of mankind.

551
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:35,578
But given the choice of life versus death,those bad,bad people are going to choose life.

552
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:37,743
Then why'd you sedate her?

553
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:42,414
If she wasn't gonna tell,if she was never gonna do the right thing,why bother knocking her out?

554
00:31:42,715 --> 00:31:46,625
This isn't about them.If she talks,if she does the decent thing,

555
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:49,742
then you don't get to solve your puzzle,your game's over,you lose.

556
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:54,033
Yeah,I want to save her;I'm morally bankrupt.

557
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,336
How's it going?

558
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:19,003
They're about to remove hannah's liver.

559
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,649
All right,I'm good to go.

560
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,656
You can start removing max's liver.

561
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:32,836
you want to let me in on what the big secret is between these two?

562
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:35,433
You read foreman's article?

563
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:39,101
It was good.

564
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:42,630
He basically stole it from me.

565
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,915
So?

566
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,629
You're on his side?

567
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:49,938
Sides?No,this isn't dodgeball.

568
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:53,256
What am I supposed to do?Just sit back and take it?

569
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:55,461
No,write another article.

570
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,288
Kick ass,until you're sitting behind some big expensive desk,

571
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,654
and someone from johns hopkins calls and says,

572
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:04,873
"we're thinking about hiring eric foreman as our head of neurology,"

573
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:07,420
and you can say whatever you want.

574
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,540
Lovely. Revenge as motive for success.

575
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:13,896
Well,it doesn't have to be the motive.

576
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:16,441
But it sure tastes good.

577
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,898
She's in vf.I've got no pulse!

578
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:20,161
She's arresting.

579
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:22,576
Paddles.

580
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:25,895
I am so relieved you two are here.

581
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,661
Without you looking out,they'd be playing foosball down there.

582
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:29,704
Max's heart stopped.

583
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,609
Your patient is on the other side.

584
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:37,453
Get yourself upstairs and figure out what hannah has,or max has risked her life for nothing.

585
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:43,588
Charging.Clear.

586
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,224
We're okay.

587
00:33:55,005 --> 00:33:59,877
max's cardiac arrest was caused by hypoxia from hypoventilation.

588
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:01,421
They restarted her heart

589
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:04,979
and the right lobe of her liver was successfully transplanted into hannah.

590
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:10,202
Now,where were we before we were so rudely interrupted by the liver transplant?

591
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:12,438
Dopa decarboxylase was processed normally

592
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:16,036
and the cerolo-plasma and copper levels were normal.So no wilson's disease.

593
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:19,154
Gastric content was negative for spores,so no mushroom toxicity.

594
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,259
And the initial tests were negative for cancer.

595
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:22,752
Which cancer were you looking for?

596
00:34:22,822 --> 00:34:23,283
Any of them.

597
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:26,261
We ran blood tests for ovarian,lung,and lymphomas.

598
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,012
It's not gonna tell you much.

599
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,538
Her blood was taken after she was given immunosuppressants.

600
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:31,173
They fight rejection.

601
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:34,781
They also mess up our ability to get any clear readings.

602
00:34:35,463 --> 00:34:39,082
Great battles kick up a lot of dirt.

603
00:34:39,573 --> 00:34:44,244
Obscure the battlefield so generals can't see what's going on.

604
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:48,124
So what are your orders,general house?

605
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:51,883
Sound the retreat.

606
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,321
How ya feeling?

607
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:57,466
Is max okay?

608
00:34:57,506 --> 00:35:00,093
She's still unconscious,but her vitals look good.

609
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:06,849
We need to stop all the immunosuppressant drugs which are protecting your new liver.

610
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,818
But if you stop the drugs,I'll die.

611
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:15,369
You're dead anyway if we don't figure out what caused all this.

612
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:18,568
By removing any outside influences,

613
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:21,133
it'll help us see what's really going on with your body.

614
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:25,805
So you did all this to buy me a couple of days,and now you're taking 'em back?

615
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:31,589
Will it hurt?

616
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,621
As your body goes into acute organ rejection,your liver will begin to swell,

617
00:35:36,682 --> 00:35:38,676
it'll put pressure on--

618
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,300
It'll hurt.We can knock you out.

619
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:49,823
Mm,no. If max wakes up,I want to talk to her.

620
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,642
She's been taking the decongestants,but she' not getting better.She also says...

621
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:03,265
what?

622
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:06,162
Her boobs are bigger.

623
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,227
How could you get them mixed up?

624
00:36:16,297 --> 00:36:19,545
They come in a little wheel,they don't look anything like decongestants.

625
00:36:19,615 --> 00:36:23,845
Oh,god! The cashier put them both in the same bag.I thought I gave her the right ones.

626
00:36:23,925 --> 00:36:26,091

628
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:34,371
No,you gave her the wrong pills.

629
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:37,058
You speak mandarin?

630
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:44,345
I can count to ten,ask to go to the bathroom,and...(¹§Ï²Äã¿ìµ±×æÄ¸ÁË£¡)

631
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:49,187

635
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:55,061
Okay,I'm going to leave you two alone now.

636
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:57,497
I'm sure you got a lot to talk about.

637
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:06,247
Fever's 106,she's in full rejection mode.

638
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:08,433
Is that supposed to surprise me?

639
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:10,688
Her white count is normal.

640
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:13,476
Normal is not normal.

641
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:17,705
She's been on steroids,transplant team gave her a cocktail of immunosuppressants,

642
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:19,741
she hasn't slept in over a week.

643
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:21,154
Her white count should be in the tank.

644
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:23,179
Looks like the problem is some sort of infection.

645
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:25,385
Probably caused a hypotension,shockethe liver.

646
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:27,750
We should start broad spectrum antibiotics.

647
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,266
Yeah,you might want to add some chicken soup.

648
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:33,283
It'd be just as useless,but it's got chicken.

649
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,979
We need to know exactly what kind of infection we're dealing with.

650
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,246
What infection causes sleep disturbance,bleeding,

651
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:41,834
movement disorder,organ failure,and an abnormally normal white count.

652
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:43,829
What about tularemia?--Chest was clear.

653
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:45,733
Tularemia doesn't cause movement disorders.

654
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:46,866
It would if she developed meningitis.

655
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:49,201
There was no ulcerations on the skin.

656
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:52,069
With the bleeding,it looks more like leptospirosis.

657
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:54,344
Without conjunctivitis and elevated creinine?

658
00:37:54,414 --> 00:37:57,011
What about typhoid or some kind of relapsing fever?

659
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:58,765
Makes sense,if we were in the sudan.

660
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:00,338
We sure she hasn't been out of the country?

661
00:38:00,418 --> 00:38:03,196
She hasn't even been out of the state in at least a year.Neither has max.

662
00:38:03,236 --> 00:38:04,789
Maybe she lied.

663
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,964
You talk to her friends,neighbors?

664
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:08,368
You don't know?

665
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:10,203
Come on,if you don't stay up to date on my notes,

666
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:12,688
where's your next article going to come from?

667
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,393
You talk to the dog?

668
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:17,560
We're not as up on foreign languages as you are.

669
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,725
Has the dog been traveling?

670
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:21,380
It came from a breeder.

671
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,542
Where?

672
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:24,547
I don't know.

673
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:29,198
A place called blue barrel kennels.They only had the thing for like two days.

674
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:32,106
Blue barrel is a kind of cactus.

675
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:35,303
You see many cacti in jersey?

676
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:45,618
Want to see a magic trick?

677
00:38:50,731 --> 00:38:53,848
Oh,no!Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

678
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:55,953
Is it here?

679
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:58,519
No.

680
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,163
What about here?

681
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,592
There it is.

682
00:39:04,163 --> 00:39:08,042
that doesn't look anything like a nose.

683
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:10,639
that wasn't there this morning.

684
00:39:24,743 --> 00:39:27,981
Get that to the lab and call cdc.

685
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:29,354
And tell them what?

686
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:32,713
That we have a patient with the plague.

687
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:36,281
The black plague?

688
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:37,764
Looks that way.

689
00:39:37,844 --> 00:39:39,699
Plague is carried by rodents,not dogs.

690
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:42,035
Where there's dogs,there's fleas.

691
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:45,443
And if they hail from the southwest,and those fleas can't tell the difference

692
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:47,748
between prairie dogs and puppy dogs...

693
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:52,831
a small percentage of plague cases present with sleep disturbance.

694
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:58,054
Imagine an idyllic river of bacteria.

695
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:00,880
Okay,it's not idyllic for her,but it serves my purposes.

696
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,223
The steroids and immunosuppressants acted like a big,honkin' dam across the river-physics 101.

697
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,680
Put a dam up in front of a raging river,the river rises.

698
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,067
By stopping the immunosuppressants,we blew up the dam

699
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:15,506
and a 100-foot wall of bacteria flooded her lymph nodes.

700
00:40:15,586 --> 00:40:17,240
We better find out where that dog is now.

701
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,766
After we start the immunosuppressants

702
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:24,076
and fill her up to the eyeballs with streptomycin sulfate gentamicin and tetracycline.

703
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:25,961
Use a garden hose if you've got one.

704
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:29,279
Get yourselves some prophylactic treatments as well.

705
00:40:30,632 --> 00:40:32,817
I've got the plague?

706
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,684
Don't worry,it's treatable.

707
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:38,250
Being a bitch,though,

708
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,228
nothing we can do about that.

709
00:40:47,754 --> 00:40:49,848
You weren't in your room.

710
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,986
The surgeon said I'd heal faster if I walk.

711
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:56,093
Got this far,needed a rest.

712
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:59,272
What you did was crazy,but it was pretty amazing too.

713
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:02,830
Yeah,I'm a hero.

714
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:08,664
She's been planning to leave me.

715
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:11,712
Really?

716
00:41:11,822 --> 00:41:16,062
She told a friend;the friend let it slip.

717
00:41:18,037 --> 00:41:22,498
You knew and you gave up half your liver anyway?

718
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:26,657
She can't leave me now.

719
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:34,948
You really want her to stay out of guilt?That's not gonna make either of you happy.

720
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:37,233
You don't know that.

721
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:39,178
I love her.

722
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:44,029
I just want her to stay.

723
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,456
I don't own house's cases.

724
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:07,416
You had just as much right as I did to write it up.

725
00:42:07,496 --> 00:42:09,100
You shoulda told me,but

726
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:12,218
i shoulda handled it better too.

727
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:20,217
If we want this not to get in the way of our friendship,I think we both have to apologize,

728
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,696
and put it behind us.

729
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,525
I like you,really.

730
00:42:27,565 --> 00:42:30,322
We have a good time working together.

731
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:35,665
But ten years from now,we're not gonna be hanging out,having dinners.

732
00:42:35,775 --> 00:42:41,379
Maybe we'll exchange christmas cards,say hi,give a hug if we're at the same conference.

733
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:47,343
We're not friends.We're colleagues.

734
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:53,859
And I don't have anything to apologize for.
