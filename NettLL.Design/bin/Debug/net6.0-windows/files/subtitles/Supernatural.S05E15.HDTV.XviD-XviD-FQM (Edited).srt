1
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:07,000
Are you saying that this
is the... Apocalypse?

2
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:09,222
And these specific omens,
they're prelude to what?

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,419
The Four Horsemen.

4
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:11,900
And which one 
rides the red horse?

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:12,923
War.

6
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,308
This town is suffering from famine.

7
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:17,300
A-as in the Horseman?

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,014
Great.

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,406
The angel of death must
be brought into this world

10
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:25,208
through a place of awful carnage.

11
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:27,735
Oh, hello death

12
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:28,959
Bobby, who is that?

13
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:30,200
She's my wife.

14
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:31,408
It's the end of the world.

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,840
And if I don't stop
it and save everyone,

16
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,608
then no one will, and we all die.

17
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,010
I'm just tired, man.

18
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:42,657
I'm done.

19
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:44,545
I am just done.

20
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,465
I need some help.

21
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,318


22
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,020
Here on the Savanna,
the wildebeest lounges.

23
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,808
Lazy and self-content...

24
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:23,607
and is oblivious to
the fierce predator

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,120
that stalks him from the shadows.

26
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:26,584
The great wildebeest
herds migrate south

27
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,559
search of water,
drinking their fill in

28
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:31,459
preparation for the
long dry season to come.

29
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,000
The wildebeest are on edge.

30
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:37,660
Every move they make, every
sound of potential attack

31
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:40,360
A mere rustle of the winds
through the bushes can spring

32
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,460
the entire herd into a
bone crushing stampede...

33
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,493
First the animal
reacts with confusion...

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,926
The wildebeest returns
wearily to its watering hole.

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,926
It's...

36
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,137
who are closing in for the kill.

37
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,014
When it attacks,
it attacks quickly.

38
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:54,381
No.

39
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:56,152
Please! God! No!

40
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:06,650
      Season 5 Episode 15
"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"

41
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:12,436
Bobby, listen, when you
get this message, call!

42
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,499
Okay?

43
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,600
Is he still not home?

44
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:16,303
How far could he get in that chair?

45
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:22,942
So, what do we do?

46
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:29,766
Well... guess we just
do it ourselves.

47
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:33,766
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,357
Mr. Wells, why don't you
tell us what you saw...

49
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,517
in your own words.

50
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:38,068
- Call me Digger.
- Digger?

51
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,052
Who... who gave you that name?

52
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,492
I did.

53
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:44,067
You gave yourself
your own nickname?

54
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,195
You can't do that.

55
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,587
Who died and made you queen?

56
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:50,747
Okay. Uh, why don't you
just tell us what you saw?

57
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,916
I saw Clay Thompson climb
into Benny Sutton's trailer

58
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,092
through the window.

59
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,244
Couple minutes later,
Clay walked out,

60
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,004
and Benny's dead.

61
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,659
And, uh...

62
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:05,403
is this the guy you saw?

63
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,876
Well, he was all covered
with mud but, yeah.

64
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,092
That's Clay.

65
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:12,316
And you are aware that Clay
Thompson died five years ago?

66
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:13,611
Yep.

67
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:16,748
And you're positive
that it was this guy.

68
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:18,772
You calling me a liar?

69
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:20,171
No, no, no.
Of course not.

70
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:21,540
Look.

71
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:24,059
Can you think of any
reason why Clay Thompson...

72
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:25,212
alive or dead...

73
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:27,091
would want to kill Benny Sutton?

74
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:28,820
Hell, yeah.

75
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:30,630
Well, five years ago,

76
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,876
Benny's the one that killed
Clay in the first place.

77
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:35,055
Is that a fact?

78
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,504
Well, yeah, so-called
"hunting accident."

79
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:38,831
But, if you ask me...

80
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:43,592
Clay came back from the grave
to get a little payback.

81
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:47,563
Go on.

82
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:51,379
Owen, put down the cupcake
and pick up an apple.

83
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:52,796
Okay?

84
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:55,219
Okay. I love you.

85
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,340
Heads up.

86
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,604
"Fargo."

87
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:04,228
Digger.

88
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,899
Sheriff.

89
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:07,652
Gentlemen.

90
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:08,571
I'm Sheriff Jody Mills.

91
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,927
I don't believe we've
had the pleasure.

92
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,744
Agents Dorfman and Neidermeyer.

93
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:13,259
FBI.

94
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:15,016
Welcome to Sioux Falls, gentlemen.

95
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,459
Can I ask you what you're
doing with Digger here?

96
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,187
Oh, they're doin' their job.

97
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:23,011
They believe me... Sheriff.

98
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,292
The FBI believes a dead
man committed a murder?

99
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,041
Look, we're just asking a
few questions, Sheriff.

100
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:30,784
That's all.

101
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,457
Of course, if a dead man
didn't commit the murder,

102
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,203
then, uh, who did?

103
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:37,623
What'd you say your
jurisdiction here was again?

104
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:38,345
Our jurisdiction is

105
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,492
wherever the United States
government sends us.

106
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,836
Oh, yeah. How 'bout
me and your supervisor

107
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:43,788
have a little chat about that?

108
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:44,714
Absolutely.

109
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:02,309
Agent Willis speaking.

110
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:05,061
Agent Willis, this is
Sheriff Jody Mills.

111
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:06,990
Bobby?

112
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:08,438
Oh...

113
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:11,598
Excuse me?

114
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,478
Is this Bobby Singer?

115
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,693
Listen, I don't know
who this is, but...

116
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:19,383
This is Agent Tom
Willis of the FBI.

117
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:20,815
Bull crap.

118
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:23,928
FBI, huh?

119
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,944
So, uh...

120
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:28,408
So you know Bobby Singer?

121
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,351
That is... a fun coincidence.

122
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,095
Here's what I know
about Bobby Singer.

123
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:35,599
He's a menace around here...

124
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,399
ass-full of drunk-and-dis-orderlies

125
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:38,305
and mail fraud.

126
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:39,394
You understanding me?

127
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,002
I think we all can agree that

128
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:43,286
you've made yourself
perfectly clear, yes.

129
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,445
So, whatever the three
of you are planning,

130
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,533
it ends here... now.

131
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:51,237
Ten-four on that, agents?

132
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:52,301
Yeah.

133
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,718
You know how
many times we called?

134
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:59,126
Where have you been?

135
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,037
Playing murder ball.

136
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,223
What's that smell?

137
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:04,816
Is that soap?

138
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:05,609
Did you clean?

139
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:06,976
What are you, my mother?

140
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,780
Bite me!

141
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,971
Bobby, seriously.

142
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:10,035
I been working.

143
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:12,355
You know, trying to find
a way to stop the devil.

144
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:14,316
- Find anything?
- What do you think?

145
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:15,571
Bobby, it's just...

146
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:18,196
there's a case

147
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,596
less than five miles
from your house.

148
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,612
What, the... the
Benny Sutton thing?

149
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:23,806
That's what this is about?

150
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:24,665
You knew about this?

151
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,519
Hell, yes. I checked
into it already.

152
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,292
There's nothing here.

153
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,860
Except a witness who saw
a dead guy commit murder.

154
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,547
What witness? Digger Wells?

155
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:32,955
Yeah. So?

156
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:34,188
So, he's a drunk.

157
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:35,660
Well, what about the
lightning storms?

158
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,612
They look like omens.

159
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:37,924
Except in February

160
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,300
in South Dakota in storm season.

161
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,595
Guys, I thought it
was something, too.

162
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:46,344
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

163
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:47,599
So who killed the guy?

164
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,824
Take your pick.

165
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,024
This Benny Sutton guy was
a grade -A- son of a bitch.

166
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:54,032
There's a list of the
living a year long

167
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:55,864
wouldn't mind putting
a cap in his ass.

168
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,864
So, you're telling
us... nothing?

169
00:07:58,919 --> 00:07:59,895
Sorry.

170
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,319
Looks like you wasted a
tank of gas on this one.

171
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:03,944
Great.

172
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:19,081
What's up?

173
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,789
Isn't that the
graveyard back there?

174
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,879
Yeah. So what? Bobby
already checked it out.

175
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:28,621
And? What, Bobby's never wrong?

176
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,782
Come on. We'll take a peek,
and then we'll hit the road.

177
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:33,158
Can't hurt.

178
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:48,110
Hey.

179
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,589
That look fresh to you?

180
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:55,181
Yeah, actually.

181
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:22,185
What's going on here?

182
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,690
I don't know, but something stinks.

183
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't shoot me! Please!

184
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,263
There's money in the safe.

185
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:26,405
We don't want your money.

186
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:27,676
What do you want?

187
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:28,844
Anything. Please...

188
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,284
You're Clay Thompson, right?

189
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,156
Who are you?

190
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,006
FBI.

191
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,213
FBI?

192
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:41,278
Oh, my God. This is about Benny.

193
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,286
Wha... what about Benny?

194
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:43,862
He killed me! He
shot me in the back!

195
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:45,606
I'm supposed to let him
get away with that?

196
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:47,693
Hold up. Are... are you confessing?

197
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:51,517
Please. I'll go with you.
Just... just don't wake my kids.

198
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,797
Y-you'll go with us where?

199
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,098
Jail.

200
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,294
Let me get this straight.

201
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,558
You're Clay Thompson,
and you died five years ago?

202
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,127
Yes.

203
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:04,659
And three days ago you
climbed out of your grave,

204
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,311
- and you killed Benny Sutton?
- Yes.

205
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,288
- So you are, in fact, a dead guy.
- I guess.

206
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,224
I-I-I don't know what I am.

207
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,664
Clay?

208
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:15,049
I called 911.

209
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,104
It's okay, honey.
These men are the FBI.

210
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:18,328
They're here about Benny.

211
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:19,560
Why don't you come
with us, Mr. Thompson?

212
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,848
I think that'd be best.

213
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:27,157
Dean.

214
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,341
He's a monster.

215
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:31,686
He's a soccer dad.

216
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:32,972
What do you want to do with him?

217
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:35,184
Freeze!

218
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,485
Drop your guns!

219
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:41,411
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right. Hey.

220
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:43,892
Remember the guy you
said that was dead

221
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,556
and couldn't possibly
commit murder?

222
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,668
There he is.

223
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:50,331
And?

224
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,579
"And"?

225
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:54,555
And you're welcome...

226
00:11:54,771 --> 00:11:56,651
for catching the
un-dead killer zombie.

227
00:11:56,788 --> 00:11:58,211
Whatever he is or isn't...

228
00:11:58,332 --> 00:11:59,464
that don't give you
the right to shoot him

229
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:01,390
- in the middle of the street.
- Shoot me?

230
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:03,340
- You're free to go, Mr. Thompson.
- Free to go?!

231
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:04,598
I can't believe you
were gonna kill me.

232
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,438
- You're a zombie!
- I'm a taxpayer!

233
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,088
So, what Sheriff's on the take?

234
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,319
Yeah. No.

235
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:19,167
The zombies are paying her off?

236
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:24,172
Hey.

237
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,716
So, what now they're friends?

238
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,271
Bobby, I thought the
Sheriff hated you?

239
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,521
She did till five days ago.

240
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:42,825
What happened five days ago?

241
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:45,146
The dead started
rising all over town.

242
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:47,698
So you knew about this?

243
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:48,858
Yep.

244
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:52,321
I think what Sam meant
to say is, you lied to us?

245
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:58,188
Look... I told you
there was nothing here.

246
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:00,444
And there isn't. Not for you.

247
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,452
There are zombies here.

248
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:08,388
There are zombies...
and then there's zombies.

249
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:10,859
Come with me.

250
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,813
You want to tell
us what the hell...

251
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,262
Oh, hey.

252
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:28,436
I didn't realize you
were bringing company.

253
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,251
It's 4 A.M. babe.
You didn't need to cook.

254
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,339
Oh, please. I'll get
some more plates.

255
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,898
Who was that?

256
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:40,898
Karen. My wife.

257
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:42,418
Your new wife?

258
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:45,673
My dead wife.

259
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:54,973
Mmm. Mmm.

260
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:57,645
This is incredible, Mrs. Singer.

261
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:58,869
Thank you, Dean.

262
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:00,673
A-hem...

263
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:01,949
What? It is.

264
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:06,561
It's great, Karen. Thanks.

265
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,960
Could you, um,
just give us a minute?

266
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:22,383
Are you crazy, what the hell?

267
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,807
Dean, I can explain.

268
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,311
Explain what, lying to us?

269
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:28,209
Or the American girl zombie
making cup-cakes in your kitchen?!

270
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:30,789
First of all, that's
my wife, so watch it.

271
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:33,709
Bobby, whatever that thing
is in there, it is not your wife.

272
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:34,765
And how do you know that?

273
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:35,717
Are you serious?

274
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:37,405
You think I'm an idiot, boy?

275
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,669
My dead wife shows
up on my doorstep,

276
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:42,157
I'm not gonna test her
every way I ever learned?

277
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:44,908
So what is it, zombies, revenant?

278
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,212
Hell if I can tell.

279
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:48,645
She's got no scars, no wounds,

280
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,893
no reaction to salt,
silver, holy water...

281
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:53,717
Bobby, she crawled
out of her coffin.

282
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,903
No, she didn't. I cremated her.

283
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:00,823
Somehow, some way, she's back.

284
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:01,974
That's impossible.

285
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:02,939
Tell me about it.

286
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:03,953
You bury her ashes?

287
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:05,185
- Yeah.
- Where?

288
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,985
In the cemetery.

289
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:08,783
That's where they all rose from.

290
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:12,031
- How many?
- 15, 20.

291
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,461
I made a list.

292
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,220
Uh, there's Karen...

293
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:18,708
Clay...

294
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:20,255
Sheriff Mills...

295
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,103
her little boy came back.

296
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:24,623
And there were
no signs, no omens?

297
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:27,799
Well, there were the
lightning storms.

298
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,167
That's what we said. What else?

299
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:44,007
"And through the fire stood
before me a pale horse.

300
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:47,487
"And he that sat atop
him carried a scythe,

301
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,167
"and I saw since he had risen,

302
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,200
"they too shall rise,

303
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,879
and from him and through him."

304
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:01,999
So, what death is behind this?

305
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:06,503
Death, death. Like
grim reaper, death?

306
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:07,855
Yeah.

307
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:10,933
Awesome.

308
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,389
Another Horseman.

309
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:14,197
Must be Thursday.

310
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,341
Bobby...

311
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,821
Why would death raise 15 people

312
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,325
in a podunk town like Sioux Falls?

313
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,133
I don't know.

314
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,189
You know, if death is behind this,

315
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:29,677
then whatever these things are...

316
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:31,790
it's not good.

317
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,629
You know what
we have to do here.

318
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,789
She doesn't remember
anything, you know.

319
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:40,426
What do you mean?

320
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:41,670
Being possessed,

321
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,988
me killing her...

322
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,113
her coming back.

323
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:47,413
Bobby...

324
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:50,241
No, no, don't "Bobby" me.

325
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:51,881
Just...

326
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:55,585
just listen, okay?

327
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:01,751
She hums when she cooks.

328
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,751
Yeah.

329
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:08,480
She always...

330
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,209
used to hum when she cooked.

331
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,711
Tone deaf as all hell, but...

332
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:22,997
And I never thought I
would hear it again.

333
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:30,229
Look, just read revelation.

334
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:33,437
The... the dead rise
during the apocalypse.

335
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,317
There's nothing in there
that says that's bad!

336
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,053
Hell, maybe it's the one good thing

337
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,185
that comes out of this
whole bloody mess.

338
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,672
And what would you
do if you were us?

339
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,265
I know what I'd do.

340
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:01,721
And I know what you
think you got to do.

341
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:03,857
But...

342
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:05,490
I'm begging you.

343
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:07,753
Please.

344
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:11,089
Please.

345
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:13,841
Leave her be.

346
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:20,964
So, what do you think?

347
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,231
There's nothing to think about.

348
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,194
I'm not gonna leave Bobby at home

349
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:25,512
with the bride of Frankenstein.

350
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:26,709
Then what do you want to do?

351
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:29,661
Just walk in there in front of
Bobby and blow her skull off?

352
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,653
If she decides that Bobby's face

353
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,814
is the blue plate special,
I'd like to be there.

354
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:38,032
Fine.

355
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,401
See what else we can find out.

356
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:57,991
Oops. Did I scare you?

357
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,789
No. No. No.

358
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:02,237
There's... nothing scary
about you at all.

359
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,651
Feel like some lunch?

360
00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:06,643
Uh... I'm good. Thanks.

361
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,840
Come on, there's more pie.

362
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,304
I don't think that
Bobby wants me inside.

363
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:12,176
Guess it'll have to be
our secret then, huh?

364
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,569
Come on.

365
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,577
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and guess that you like pies.

366
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,169
Did you bake all these?

367
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:52,909
I don't know what it is.

368
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:55,049
Since I got back,
I can't stop baking.

369
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:57,377
Yeah, when do you
have time to sleep?

370
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:58,661
I don't.

371
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:00,833
Must be the excitement.

372
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,673
Or being dead.

373
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:09,424
I know you don't trust me.

374
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:10,665
Why would you say that?

375
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,081
Come on, Dean.

376
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:13,624
That's why you're here, isn't it?

377
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,681
Keeping an eye on me?

378
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,154
I know who you are.

379
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,306
Just like I know
Bobby's not the same

380
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:26,945
mild-mannered scrap
dealer I married.

381
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:30,201
You hunt things.

382
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,593
I... I'm a thing.

383
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,657
I get it.

384
00:20:37,842 --> 00:20:39,232
So then you know that Sam and I

385
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:41,144
would never let anything
happen to Bobby.

386
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,553
He's like a father to us.

387
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:43,777
I understand.

388
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,873
And he's lucky to have you
looking out for him, Dean.

389
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,249
But you're not the only one.

390
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:50,609
Is that so?

391
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,193
I remember everything, you know.

392
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:00,161
When I died.

393
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,185
That demon taking over my body...

394
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:05,873
and the things it made me do.

395
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:09,337
And Bobby having
no choice but to...

396
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:13,016
well, you know what he did.

397
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,657
But I can see it in his
eyes when he looks at me.

398
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:21,449
The guilt.

399
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:23,929
It weighs on him.

400
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,241
So why don't you just
tell him you remember?

401
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,539
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

402
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:34,061
and say you've
never been in love.

403
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,693
He's my husband.

404
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,205
My job is to bring him peace...

405
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:41,836
not pain.

406
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:57,775
Mrs. Jones?!

407
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:15,659
Ezra Jones?

408
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:39,328
Um... Ezra Jones?

409
00:22:55,778 --> 00:22:56,749
W-what is it?

410
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,171
You think maybe you
could tell me from here?

411
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:05,675
Yeah. I'm gonna regret this.

412
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,811
Keep your damn voices
down. Karen's upstairs.

413
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:06,009
Oh, I'm sorry. We're a
little tense right now.

414
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:07,657
Who's old lady Jones?

415
00:24:07,777 --> 00:24:09,888
- The first one to come up.
- First one to go bad.

416
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:12,729
- Ah, she was always a nutty broad.
- Nutty how?

417
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:14,665
Nutty like the way she ate
her husband's stomach?

418
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:16,480
Was that the level of
nutty she was in life?

419
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:18,473
No.

420
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:21,177
Look, Bobby, I feel for you.

421
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:22,505
But you have got to acknowledge

422
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:24,353
that you're not exactly
seeing this straight!

423
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:25,724
Bobby, whether
you admit it or not,

424
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:26,832
these things are turning.

425
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,872
We have to stop them. All of them.

426
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:37,039
- Time to go.
- What?

427
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,999
You heard me. Off my property.

428
00:24:40,303 --> 00:24:42,031
Or what, you'll shoot?

429
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:45,919
If Karen turns, I will handle it...

430
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:47,206
my way.

431
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,518
This is dangerous.

432
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:52,687
I'm not telling you twice.

433
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:13,743
He's crazy.

434
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,919
It's his wife, Dean.

435
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,218
So he goes "Full
Metal Jacket" on us?

436
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,714
We're his family, Sam.

437
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:19,555
Look, man. Bigger fish, okay?

438
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,433
I mean, we got a bunch of zombies

439
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,605
about to turn this town
into a giant chew toy.

440
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,748
Yeah, and he's
alone in the house

441
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:24,793
making pie with one of 'em!

442
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:26,585
- All right. So?
- So?!

443
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:29,279
I'm gonna have to go back there

444
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,709
and... and... and kill her.

445
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,519
That's the only thing
I can think of.

446
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:34,302
If he sees you,
you're a dead man.

447
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:37,023
Well, then I guess I
won't let him see me.

448
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:39,795
Okay.

449
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,490
I'll... head to town

450
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:45,299
and rescue everyone. Should be easy.

451
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:46,794
Sounds like.

452
00:25:47,652 --> 00:25:48,606
I'm gonna need some help.

453
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,079
What about the Sheriff?

454
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,113
Uh, last time I checked,

455
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,460
the Sheriff was pretty pro-zombie.

456
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:54,190
Well, I guess you'll just
have to convince her.

457
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,278
- How?
- I don't know.

458
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:57,194
You're just gonna.

459
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,635
There. Does that
feel better, honey?

460
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,860
I'm so hungry, mommy.

461
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:06,661
Oh, I know. I know.

462
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:10,197
Mommy's gonna make
you some soup, okay?

463
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,557
Okay.

464
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:13,413
I don't know what
else to tell you, doc.

465
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:15,941
We checked the
thermometer three times.

466
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,612
His temperature is 111 degrees.

467
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,108
- Mommy.
- Hold on, doc.

468
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:22,456
- I'm hungry!
- Can you take that in to him?

469
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:28,555
Dr. Dwight, it's Jody Mills.

470
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:37,363
Karen, stay away
from the windows.

471
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,922
Karen?

472
00:26:44,074 --> 00:26:45,056
Karen?!

473
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,107
Karen?

474
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:55,741
- I'm... I'm okay.
- Yeah?

475
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:56,697
I'm okay.

476
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:57,843
I just...

477
00:26:58,691 --> 00:26:59,739
I'm okay.

478
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,283
I... I just got to be dizzy.

479
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:07,484
You're burning up.

480
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:08,526
Oh, I'm okay.

481
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:11,222
I... I just need
something to eat.

482
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:13,198
And I'll be fine. Really.

483
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:21,811
I don't know how to
explain it, doctor.

484
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:24,090
That's... that's why
we're calling you. I...

485
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,427
Sean?

486
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,529
Owen?

487
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:52,675
Oh, my God.

488
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,559
- Let's go!
- No!

489
00:28:13,703 --> 00:28:14,510
Go!

490
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,003
- My husband!
- Leave it! He's dead!

491
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,188
- That was not my son!
- You're right. It wasn't.

492
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:22,363
Listen, Sheriff.
Your town is in danger.

493
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:23,386
People are in danger,

494
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:24,763
and we need to help them now.

495
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:28,074
Can you do that for me?
Can you focus for me, Sheriff?

496
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:31,252
Sheriff?

497
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:35,741
How do we put them down?

498
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:36,949
Head shot.

499
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,010
We're gonna need weapons.

500
00:28:47,522 --> 00:28:49,482
We can start by rounding
up everybody we can find.

501
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:51,915
Where is there a safe
place we can take people?

502
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:53,979
Jail.

503
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:56,907
Right.

504
00:28:58,996 --> 00:29:00,291
Just, um...

505
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,083
Give me a minute.

506
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:36,403
I'm so hungry, Bobby.

507
00:29:36,664 --> 00:29:39,411
I'll fix you something
to eat... in a minute.

508
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:42,595
I can feel it. It's happening.

509
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:45,396
It's gonna be all right.

510
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:47,397
No.

511
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:49,317
It's not.

512
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:51,261
I'm turning, Bobby.

513
00:29:51,677 --> 00:29:53,389
You know I am.

514
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:05,175
It's okay.

515
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,817
- Do it.
- No way.

516
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:08,500
- Please.
- No.

517
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:15,534
I remember.

518
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:19,041
You remember what?

519
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:21,478
Everything.

520
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:25,057
The demon inside me.

521
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:26,777
You killing me.

522
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,841
I remember.

523
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,177
Then you know...

524
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:35,511
why I can't do it again.

525
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:42,794
I remember something else, too.

526
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:46,004
When I came back...

527
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:48,371
there was a man.

528
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:51,008
What do you mean, a man?

529
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:52,366
At the grave.

530
00:30:53,189 --> 00:30:54,841
He was so thin.

531
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:56,442
Like a skeleton.

532
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,277
And he told me to
give you message.

533
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:02,741
Me?

534
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:06,037
W-why didn't you
tell me this before?

535
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,075
You've seen so much.

536
00:31:10,142 --> 00:31:11,598
I just...

537
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,741
I just wanted to see you smile.

538
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,221
What was the message?

539
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,094
Bobby?!

540
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:14,609
All right, if I hand you a gun
and you see a dead person,

541
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:16,108
I don't care if it's your friend,

542
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:18,509
your neighbor, or your wife.

543
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:20,142
You shoot for the head.

544
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,575
That's the only way we survive.

545
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:24,575
Uh, you mind telling us
who the hell you are?

546
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,008
Friend of Bobby Singer's.

547
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:27,041
Town drunk.

548
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:30,813
No, I-I thought...

549
00:32:32,024 --> 00:32:33,641
he was the town drunk.

550
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:34,674
Who told you that?

551
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:37,290
Bobby Singer.

552
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:41,041
Stay sharp.

553
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:43,352
I'll watch the front door.

554
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:56,741
You know, Bobby, if you
want to sit this one out...

555
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:01,575
Let's just get going.

556
00:33:52,442 --> 00:33:53,375
Dean?

557
00:33:54,052 --> 00:33:55,019
Dean?!

558
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:13,679
Dean?

559
00:34:44,713 --> 00:34:45,979
Dean!

560
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:03,445
Little help here?

561
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:13,145
- That's fine.
- Yeah, fine.

562
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:33,719
You got any more ammo? I'm low.

563
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:34,819
Yeah, we got plenty.

564
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:36,183
Just run back past the zombies.

565
00:35:36,415 --> 00:35:37,816
It's in the van,
where we left it.

566
00:35:37,882 --> 00:35:39,115
A simple "no" would have been fine.

567
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,515
What are they all
doing here, anyway?!

568
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:42,182
- I think I get it.
- What?

569
00:35:44,482 --> 00:35:45,382
Oh, that ain't good.

570
00:35:53,046 --> 00:35:53,916
I'm out.

571
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:54,782
- Me too.
- Come on!

572
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:23,916
Kind of a tight fit,
don't you think?

573
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,148
It's all right. They're idiots.

574
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:26,242
They can't pick a lock.

575
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:38,696
Don't you ever get
tired of being wrong?

576
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,147
I'm making this
stuff up as I go.

577
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:41,207
Sue me.

578
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:54,536
Get down!

579
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:28,715
Are you okay?

580
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,867
Well, if there's any
zombies left out there,

581
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:53,106
we can't find them.

582
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:56,188
How are the townspeople?

583
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:57,611
Pretty freaked out.

584
00:37:58,308 --> 00:37:59,995
Hell, traumatized.

585
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:02,547
A few of them are
calling the papers.

586
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:05,175
As far as I can tell,
nobody's believed 'em yet.

587
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,333
Would you?

588
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,865
How are you holding up?

589
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:24,281
Is that everyone?

590
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:28,561
All but one.

591
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,884
So, thinking maybe
I should apologize

592
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,484
for losing my head back there.

593
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:56,655
Bobby...

594
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:00,249
you don't owe us anything.

595
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:03,744
Hey, look, I don't know squat
from shinola about love, but...

596
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,096
At least you got to spend
five days with her, right?

597
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:10,790
Right.

598
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:16,075
Which makes things about
a thousand times worse.

599
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:20,937
She was the love of my life.

600
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:23,124
How many times do
I got to kill her?

601
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:29,769
Are you gonna
be okay, Bobby?

602
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,585
You boys should know...

603
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:43,074
Karen told me
why death was here.

604
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:44,506
What do you mean?

605
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:47,137
I know why he took a
stroll through a cemetery

606
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,077
in the sticks of South Dakota.

607
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,501
He came for me.

608
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:54,707
What do you mean, you?

609
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:56,642
Death came for me.

610
00:39:57,802 --> 00:40:00,593
He brought Karen back
to send me a message.

611
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,605
You, why you?

612
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,216
Because I've been helping you,
you sons of bitches.

613
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:09,598
I'm one of the reasons you're
still saying no to Lucifer, Sam.

614
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:13,881
So this was like a
hit on your life?

615
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:16,198
I don't know if they wanted
to take my life or...

616
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,488
my spirit.

617
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,186
Either way, they wanted
me out of the way.

618
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:25,698
But you're gonna be all right.

619
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:29,009
Right, Bobby?
