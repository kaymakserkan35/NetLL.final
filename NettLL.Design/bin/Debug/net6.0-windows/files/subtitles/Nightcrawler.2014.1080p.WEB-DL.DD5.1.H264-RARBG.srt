1
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,020
What are you doing out here?

2
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,388
I'm lost.

3
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,190
This is a restricted area.

4
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,525
Oh, I didn't know
that. There's no signs.

5
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,294
They're everywhere.

6
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,629
Let's see some ID.

7
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,331
Why?

8
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,134
There's a broken gate back
there, and you're trespassing.

9
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,203
Excuse me, sir, that gate was open

10
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,171
and I was under the opinion
that this was a detour.

11
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,340
Let me see the ID. Take it out.

12
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,808
What kind of uniform is that?

13
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,878
I'll ask the fucking questions.

14
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,380
It's a private outfit, huh?

15
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,150
I tried to get one of those
jobs. I like guarding things.

16
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,585
Really?

17
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,753
Here you go, sir.

18
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,021
I think what must have happened

19
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,791
is I just must have
gotten turned around.

20
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,832
<i>Is it in the high-end
or the low-end range?</i>

21
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,200
<i>Oh, there's no question it's up!</i>

22
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,902
<i>Yes, but 20%?</i>

23
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,671
<i>Foreclosure, foreclosure, foreclosure!</i>

24
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,007
<i>We're talking about over
two-thirds of the market,</i>

25
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,775
<i>and, of course, it's
linked to unemployment.</i>

26
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,510
<i>So, the opportunity for the average</i>

27
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,346
<i>investor with the right know-how...</i>

28
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,715
<i>Is all in the book. In the seminars.</i>

29
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,617
<i>Very little doubt?</i>

30
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,018
<i>Yes, their distress sales makes
them want them off the books.</i>

31
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,353
<i>Oh...</i>

32
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,522
<i>They need to sell them.
They have to, right?</i>

33
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,194
<i>...you name it, we teach them all.</i>

34
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,395
<i>I guesstimate</i>

35
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,731
that I have about 50
pounds of copper wire,

36
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:26,965
100 pounds of chain-link fence

37
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,635
and two manhole covers.
The nice thick ones.

38
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,737
I'll give 50 cents a pound for the wire,

39
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,472
15 for the fence, and 10 for the covers.

40
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,240
That's below market value.

41
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,775
Market value?

42
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,611
You know the cops came by
asking about manhole covers?

43
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,648
I'd like to counter at a
dollar a pound for the copper,

44
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,616
30 cents a pound for the fence,

45
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,485
and 20 cents per for the covers.

46
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,953
Ah, sell them somewhere else.

47
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,122
I'd feel good at 75, 25, and 15.

48
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,723
I'm not negotiating with you.

49
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,225
I think we're close. I'm done.

50
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,135
I'm willing to take less to
establish a business relationship.

51
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,470
If that's your last best
offer, then I guess I accept.

52
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,905
All right. Drive around
back and unload them.

53
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,510
Excuse me, sir?

54
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,746
I'm looking for a job.

55
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,181
In fact, I've made up my mind

56
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,617
to find a career that I
can learn and grow into.

57
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,320
Who am I? I'm a
hard-worker, I set high goals

58
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,121
and I've been told that I am persistent.

59
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,823
Now, I'm not fooling myself, sir.

60
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,525
Having been raised with
the self-esteem movement

61
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,693
so popular in schools,

62
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,361
I used to expect my
needs to be considered.

63
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:30,796
But I know that today's work culture

64
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,664
no longer caters to the job loyalty that

65
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,499
could be promised to
earlier generations.

66
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,368
What I believe, sir, is that good things

67
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,170
come to those who work their asses off.

68
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,538
And that people such as yourself,

69
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,973
who reach the top of the
mountain, didn't just fall there.

70
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,042
My motto is if you
wanna win the lottery,

71
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,711
you have to make the
money to buy a ticket.

72
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,914
Did I say that I worked in a garage?

73
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:55,187
So, what do you say? I could
start tomorrow, or why not tonight?

74
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,188
No.

75
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:06,965
How about an internship then?

76
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,367
A lot of young people are taking

77
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,835
unpaid positions to
get a foot in the door.

78
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,636
That's something I'd be willing to do.

79
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,472
I'm not hiring a fucking thief.

80
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,774
This thing's gonna blow!

81
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,008
Crap! Gotta move!

82
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,747
Help!

83
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,091
This thing is not budging. Hold on.

84
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,194
I can't move!

85
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,273
Let's go. Let's go!

86
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,045
Let's go!

87
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,382
We're first!

88
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:33,051
No shit! Get a shot on the other side!

89
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,152
All right, all right.

90
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,123
Get a shot inside the car.

91
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,762
Go around. Get inside the car.

92
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,063
The fuck am I paying you for?

93
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,971
Yeah, it's free.

94
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,473
Get back, Loder. Get back!

95
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,141
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back!

96
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:01,213
All units. EMS, just past exit 31.

97
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,934
Excuse me.

98
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,769
Will this be on television?

99
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,038
Morning news. If it bleeds, it leads.

100
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,473
What channel?

101
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,309
Whoever pays the most.

102
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,245
What do you get for something like this?

103
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,014
Not nearly enough.

104
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,888
Enough to buy all that gear.

105
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,689
Let me tell you something.

106
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,191
It's a flaming asshole of a job.

107
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:50,262
Can I ask you, are you currently hiring?

108
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,865
Fuck, no.

109
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,234
Well, thank you for taking the time

110
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,802

111
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,487

I don't know. I'll give you $500.

162
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,193
This is a custom racing bicycle, sir.

163
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,728
Designed for competitive road cycling.

164
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,262
This bike has a light-weight,

165
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,597
space-age carbon frame

166
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,566
and handlebars positioned
to put the rider

167
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,434
in a more aerodynamic posture.

168
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,336
It also has micro-shifters
and 37 gears,

169
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,571
and weighs under six pounds.

170
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,873
I won the Tour de Mexico on this bike.

171
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,008
$700 is as high as I'll go.

172
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,945
It cost me over $8,000 new.

173
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,179
$700.

174
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,581
$2,500, and that's giving it away.

175
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,583
No bike has got 37 gears.

176
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,419
$2,000.

177
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,653
No.

178
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,890
Could I please speak to your boss?

179
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:39,758
I'm the owner.

180
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,663
How about $800 in store credit?

181
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,399
What are you after?

182
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,335
A camcorder and a police scanner.

183
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,076
<i>7-X-76 Roger.

194
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,285
Hey! Who the hell are you?

195
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,619
Freelance!

196
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,921
What are you doing?

197
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:43,855
Filming for TV.

198
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,223
No. Back away.

199
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,358
What's happening?

200
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,827
I said turn around and leave.

201
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,962
I'm fairly certain I'm
allowed to film this.

202
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,297
Film what?

203
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,632
I don't know. What's happening?

204
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,001
Walk away, or get
arrested for obstruction.

205
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,136
Yes, Officer.

206
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,637
Hurry up. Get out of here.

207
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,843
Blow, blow, blow. Almost. Almost.

208
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,612
Will you move that cam?
Man, you better back up.

209
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,314
Leave!

210
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,115
Do you think I'm playing with you?

211
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,788
<i>More street units, ambulance to 11.</i>

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,723

<i>Code Three, incident 4259. ID 703.</i>

215
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,153
All right, let's get some blood
pressure. He's pretty shocked.

216
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,855
Breathing is very shallow.

217
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,258
He's got a second chest wound
here. MEDIC 1: Put pressure on it.

218
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,059
We got it. Strap it on the other side.

219
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,327
You got a dressing on it? MEDIC 1: Yeah.

220
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,663
GCS is
1-1-1, guys.

221
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,231
Give me pressure.

222
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,933
90 over 60.

223
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,068
No radial pulse.

224
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,336
We're losing him.

225
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,638
He's bleeding out. Can you bag him?

226
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,676
Let's start bagging him.
Keep on high flow, too.

227
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,378
Yep.

228
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,379
I got no pulse here.

229
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,947
Unresponsive.

230
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,116
Get back. You. Get back.

231
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,584
Get the fuck back now.

232
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,887
Okay.

233
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,422
Shit. All right.

234
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,392
Get back, 100 feet back, now.

235
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,527
You get back, too. 100 feet.

236
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,397
Fucking asshole, you shut it down.

237
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,532
I had a great fucking angle
back there until you crowded in.

238
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,801
Get the fuck home. There's people
trying to do their fucking job.

239
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,269
Fucking asshole.

240
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,109
Yeah. It's Ace Video. Your lead's
gonna be at First and Western.

241
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,812
Yeah, you wanna get
there. It's a shooting.

242
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,315
Yeah, I got some great footage
of a victim being treated.

243
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,150
No, the LAPD hasn't released it

244
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,818
but a manager at a Walgreens says

245
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,420
it's a carjacking and
the victim is the owner.

246
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,955
He's Asian and critical.

247
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,489
Right.

248
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,924
Look, I got a 60-second cut

249
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,125
with the manager and a neighbor.

250
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,962
$500.

251
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,564
Then, make me a deal. $400.

252
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,299
$300. All right, deal.

253
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,004
Are you fucking kidding me?

254
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,305
Get out of here.

255
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,052
Okay, dip into graphics.

256
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,021
I don't think that's going to cover it.

257
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,555
Frank, it's not my call.

258
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,959
Oh, excuse me.

259
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,463
Excuse me. I have video footage.

260
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,631
Uh, down the hall, to the right.

261
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,371
Right here. Okay.

262
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,007
Put the neighbor here, and the
kids with their mother by the door.

263
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,343
You can get it back from
2:16. MALE EDITOR: Yeah.

264
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,811
Then I want to lay in some nat-sound.

265
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:27,979
Let's loop the neighbor's dog barking.

266
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,548
And then try taking the
crying kid from B-roll

267
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,050
and dropping that in the background.

268
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,484
Got it.

269
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,919
You my fill-in operator?

270
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,055
I don't think so. I'm Lou Bloom.

271
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,556
I have some footage for sale.

272
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,891
A stringer?

273
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,793
What? Who do you work for?

274
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,398
At the moment, I work for myself.

275
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,334
See Frank out there, the way you came.

276
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,502
Uh, what's it timed to?

277
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,570
1:06.

278
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,006
What do you have?

279
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,210
Something I'm fairly certain

280
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,078
you'll be very excited about.

281
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,113
What is it?

282
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:05,216
It's a shooting. A man was
shot. Several times, in fact.

283
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,919
He's lying on the ground, and
he's bleeding on the ground.

284
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,720
I'd be surprised if
he survived, honestly.

285
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,556
He was shot during a carjacking.

286
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:12,623
Western and First?

287
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,559
Yes, that's right.

288
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,761
We're getting that from Ace.

289
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,063
I was there. I was much
closer to what happened.

290
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,732
Okay. Okay.

291
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:22,934
Let's see it.

292
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,005
You can fast forward through this.

293
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,310
Keep going, keep going.

294
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,612
<i>Walk away, or I'll arrest you for...</i>

295
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,114
A minute-and-a-half
in.

296
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,986
There.

297
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,621
Oh, fuck.

298
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,693
I need you to see something.

299
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,603
Yeah? Lou Bloom.

300
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:01,239
Frank Kruse, our assignment editor.

301
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,406
Play it back.

302
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,210
<i>I got no pulse, here.</i>

303
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,181
That's the lead.

304
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,783
I want to break it up and do
a wrap-around from the scene.

305
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,586
I want a walking stand-up,
teaser at five, repeat on the half

306
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,021
and I want the copy to
start with a warning.

307
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,156
You're going to show this?

308
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,091
With a warning. It's excessive.

309
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,859
We should have packages
like this every day.

310
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,261
People are eating breakfast.

311
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,263
And they'll talk about it at work.

312
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,365
Tie it in with the carjacking
last month in Glendale.

313
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,535
And the other one, the van in
Palms. When was that? In March?

314
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:31,769
March, yeah.

315
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,337
It's a carjacking crime wave.

316
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,039
That's the banner.

317
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,807
Call the victim's family,
get a quote, mic it.

318
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,176
You know what to do.

319
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,010
Yeah.

320
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,213
How much?

321
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,848
I'm selling this
particular piece for $1,000.

322
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,016
Not even close.

323
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,684
This late, you have nowhere else to go.

324
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,686
And the quality's for shit.

325
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,855
I'll give you $250,
that's the most I'll do.

326
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:51,956
Now, let's get you paid.

327
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,960
Here you go.

328
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,496
Buy yourself some better
equipment, a directional mic,

329
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,064
and get interviews when you can.

330
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,232
You have a good eye.

331
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,667
Thank you.

332
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,136
I'm just beginning, so praise
from someone such as yourself,

333
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:07,004
well, you can imagine
that it means quite a lot.

334
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,973
I'll help in any way I can.

335
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,509
And, of course, you can
help me by calling us first.

336
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,711
I want you to contact me
when you have something.

337
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,046
Something like this. That's right.

338
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,048
Bloody.

339
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,483
Well, that's only part
of it. We like crime.

340
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,018
Not all crime.

341
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,321
Carjacking in Compton, for example.

342
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,855
That isn't news, now is it?

343
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,358
We find our viewers are more interested

344
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,261
in urban crime creeping
into the suburbs.

345
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,830
What that means is a victim, or victims,

346
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,366
preferably well-off and white,

347
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:38,236
injured at the hands of
the poor or a minority.

348
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,670
Just crime.

349
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,439
No. Accidents play.

350
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,608
Cars, busses, trains, planes. Fires.

351
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,842
But bloody.

352
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,179
Well, graphic.

353
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:49,847

00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,098
I bet I wasted five dollars
of gas just getting here

533
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,533
or don't you think
that's a lot of money?

534
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,468
I'm sorry.

535
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,537
I couldn't see the screen,
you were driving so fast.

536
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,440
Okay, first of all, Richard,

537
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:13,343
don't answer me by telling me a problem.

538
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,012
I have enough of those already.

539
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,547
Bring me a solution, and then
we can make a decision together.

540
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,684
Okay. Maybe if you didn't rush me.

541
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:24,955
Don't rush you. Okay.

542
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,291
I can use that.

543
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,960
See, Rick, they've done studies

544
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,629
and they found that in any
system that relies on cooperation

545
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,031
from a school of fish,

546
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,667
say, or even a professional
hockey team, for example,

547
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,436
these experts have
identified communication

548
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,505
as the number one single key to success.

549
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,682
You know what "fear" stands for?

550
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,283
What?

551
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,586
"False Evidence Appearing Real. "

552
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,624
You're going really fucking fast, dude.

553
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:01,825
Get out of your head, Rick.

554
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:03,527
It's a bad neighborhood.

555
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,862
Now, when you get a chance,

556
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,396
I'd like to know where we're going.

557
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,098
Uh, left on Third. Six blocks.

558
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,040
Find a more appropriate
place to park the car,

559
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,675
and don't get blocked in.

560
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,377
Are you the one that made the call?

561
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,012
No, no. I think...

562
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,681
I was trying to go to
sleep, and I heard a sound.

563
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,683
It scared me. That's why I called.

564
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,552
Sir, what's going on?

565
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,653
Who the fuck are you?

566
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,361
TV news. What happened?

567
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,196
It was a shooting.

568
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,398
I told the cops that he
was waving a gun last week,

569
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,833
but they didn't fucking care.

570
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,236
Can you try one more
time without swearing?

571
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,537
I'm not doing it again.

572
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,673
But this is for TV.

573
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,375
Yeah? I don't have a TV.

574
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,220
It's over.

575
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:04,955
Shot the place to shit.

576
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,533
All right, guys, pack
it up. Let's move it out.

577
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,703
...running out of there as fast as
we could. Through that window there.

578
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:27,571
<i>Great shot.</i>

579
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,075
Oh, that's fantastic.

580
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,745
Oh, that's a great piece of tape.

581
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,148
You didn't get an
interview with the couple?

582
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,683
I have footage of them.

583
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,184
I have an interview with a neighbor.

584
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,652
She curses, but you can cut that out.

585
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,554
How did you get inside the house?

586
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:45,655
The door was open.

587
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:46,723
They allowed you?

588
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,125
I heard somebody yell to come in,

589
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,526
and when nobody was inside, I left.

590
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,395
And the only shot of the
couple is through a window?

591
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,063
The police were shutting it down.

592
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,531
I don't like it. Like what?

593
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,299
The footage looks like he broke in.

594
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,001
There's no close-up of the homeowners

595
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,136
and he's giving us their name

596
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,637
off a piece of private correspondence.

597
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,638
Excuse me, that's junk mail.

598
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,407
Well, I have a problem with that.

599
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,875
We'll knock out a killer package.

600
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,543
This is my job. No!

601
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,545
Your job is writing
the tweet of the day.

602
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,913
And getting Deb to turn sideways

603
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,148
during the weather forecast.

604
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,417
We're running it.

605
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,419
I like how you handled Frank.

606
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,554
You didn't soften the
truth or dilute it.

607
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,589
I think being clear with your
objectives is more important

608
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,558
than trying to present your ideas

609
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,393
in a non-confrontational manner.

610
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,595
Do you have experience in an office?

611
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,531
Myself? Not presently, no.

612
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,166
Where did you get all that?

613
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,333
I study a lot online.

614
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,701
Yeah? Like what?

615
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,370
All sorts of things, actually.

616
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,638
I'm on my computer all day.

617
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,442
I haven't had what you'd call
much of a formal education,

618
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:40,744
but you can find most anything
if you look hard enough.

619
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:52,689
Last year, I took an online
business course, for example.

620
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,559
And I learned that you
have to have a business plan

621
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,627
before starting a business.

622
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,963
And that why you pursue something

623
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,865
is equally as important
as what you pursue.

624
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,436
The site advised you

625
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,904
to answer the following question

626
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,140
before you decide where
to focus your abilities.

627
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,741
The question was

628
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,443
"What do I love to do?"

629
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,580
The site suggested making a list

630
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,981
of your strengths and weaknesses.

631
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,282
What am I good at?

632
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,585
What am I not good at?

633
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,487
Maybe I want to strengthen
and develop knowledge

634
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,788
about the things I'm already good at.

635
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,890
Maybe I want to
strengthen my weaknesses.

636
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,965
I recently remade my list.

637
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,302
And I'm thinking

638
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,605
that television news

639
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:44,908
might just be something I love

640
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,877
as well as something
I happen to be good at.

641
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,359
On TV, it looks so real.

642
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,729
Yes. It does.

643
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,599
Well, I have a show to do.

644
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,502
Your check is at the desk.

645
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,938
Outstanding work, Lou.
Really, just great.

646
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,007
Thanks, Nina. That means an awful lot.

647
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,610
Okay.

648
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,537
<i>It's every parent's nightmare.</i>

649
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,873
<i>Imagine singing a lullaby to your
infant and tucking them into bed</i>

650
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,908
<i>and then having to shield them</i>

651
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,710
<i>as a barrage of high-caliber bullets</i>

652
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,745
<i>literally blast into your home.</i>

653
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,347
<i>For the Cahills of Echo Park,</i>

654
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:00,183
<i>that fear became a terrifying reality</i>

655
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:03,053
<i>when an adjacent house
became the setting for a scene</i>

656
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,821
<i>right out of the Wild West.</i>

657
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,838
<i>Dude!</i>

658
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,240
<i>Paying too much at the pump?</i>

659
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:32,676
<i>Well, sign up for our super saver card</i>

660
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:35,812
<i>and you'll be saving buckets
of duckets on every purchase.</i>

661
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,414
<i>Takes minutes to sign up</i>

662
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,449
<i>and you'll start saving right away.</i>

663
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:42,085
<i>You'll also be eligible

664
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,921
<i>So sign up now and start saving!</i>

665
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,812
Rick, I'm very pleased
with how you progressed.

666
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,847
You're doing a great job.

667
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,282
However, you just
spilled gasoline on my car

668
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:13,383
which will eat the paint.

669
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,151
I need you tighten up a bit on this.

670
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,319
Because if you fill it like that again,

671
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,387
I will terminate you immediately,

672
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,122
I promise you.

673
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,726
"Bed, Bath & Beyond. "

674
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,161
Oh, that's a good store.

675
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,032
Making peace with what you don't have,

676
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,934
that's what it's all about.

677
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,704
Living with what you ain't got, right?

678
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,672
Don't you think?

679
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:10,774
<i>Traffic units,</i>

680
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:11,941
<i>ambulance traffic, Benedict Canyon.</i>

681
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,176
<i>Overturned vehicle with injuries.</i>

682
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:15,678
Crash with injuries. Good neighborhood.

683
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,284
TV news. What happened?

684
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,186
I think it was a head-on collision,

685
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:24,687
and there's a guy who's dead over there.

686
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,589
There's a woman... Did
you see what happened?

687
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,525
Am I supposed to help? I
didn't see, I came after.

688
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,026
Can you tell me exactly what happened?

689
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,428
Will you get the camera out of my face?

690
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,796
Get it out!

691
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,264
I'm trying to talk to 911!

692
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,134
No, it's at... The guy is down.

693
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:26,075
Make some room! We'll block it off.

694
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,756
Not getting through here.

695
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:41,758
Son of a bitch.

696
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,060
Let's go.

697
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,161
Fuck this.

698
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:49,132
Here you go.

699
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,239
Ben Waterman wears the
same gold tie on Fridays.

700
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,607
We're leading with it.

701
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:59,108
That's your third start this week.

702
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:02,712
I'm focusing on framing.

703
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,948
A proper frame not only
draws the eye into a picture

704
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,683
but keeps it there longer,

705
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:07,917
dissolving the barrier

706
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,752
between the subject and
the outside of the frame.

707
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,256
Is that blood on your shirt?

708
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:16,893
I don't think so.

709
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:19,395
I recently heard of a Mexican restaurant

710
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:20,964
called Cabanita. Have you heard of it?

711
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,699
It's also on your sleeve.

712
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,602
I didn't see that.

713
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:29,639
What I'm asking is,

714
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:30,540
do you like Mexican food, Nina?

715
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,710
Yes.

716
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:36,312
Stand by, people. Here we go.

717
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,081
Cabanita has been called

718
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:39,148
"an authentic taste of Mexico City. "

719
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:43,786
Do you wanna go with me?

720
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,821
I think we could have fun together.

721
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:48,091
Thanks, but I'm busy.

722
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,092
Saturday is your night off, isn't it?

723
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:51,060
I have a rule, Lou.

724
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,262
I don't date people I work with.

725
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,064
And I'm twice your age.

726
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,299
I like older women.

727
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,568
Besides, I don't work with you.

728
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,669
You're someone I sell to.

729
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:02,271
And I don't wanna fuck that up.

730
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:05,308
What if by saying no, you fuck it up?

731
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,809
All right, 10 seconds to go and back on.

732
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,177
Is that what you're saying?

733
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:11,614
I didn't say that.

734
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:15,184
Eight, seven, six, five...

735
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,919
Well, I don't know what to say.

736
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,955
...three, two, one.

737
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:20,990
Good morning. Thank you for
joining us. I'm Lisa Mays.

738
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,358
And I'm Ben Waterman.

739
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,494
<i>First up on This Morning on KWLA News,</i>

740
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,963
a horrible car crash
over in Benedict Canyon.

741
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,132
It's claimed the life now of one man.

742
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:30,600
Severely injured a young woman.

743
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:33,569
Hey, Lou!

744
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,675
Hey, man. Joe Loder, Mayhem.

745
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,643
Great get tonight.

746
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:43,146
They were closing it down
by the time we showed up.

747
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:45,314
Were you waiting for me out here?

748
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,650
No, I was driving by and I saw your car.

749
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:50,553
You're not dropping your shit
off, are you? Nobody does that.

750
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:52,989
You need an air card if
you want to be in the game.

751
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,824
Import the video to your laptop.

752
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,958
Cut the video.

753
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,627
Upload to your FTP site

754
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:59,962
and notify stations you
got something for sale.

755
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:01,531
Boom, boom, boom!

756
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,266
Otherwise, it's a nice ride.

757
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,569
Listen, man, you got a good run going

758
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,304
but there's valleys out there.

759
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,973
Take it from me. I've been
nightcrawling for 14 years.

760
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,542
You heard I'm adding a second van?

761
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:13,876
No. I didn't hear that.

762
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,312
Gonna be a game changer.

763
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:18,347
Cut my on-scene time in half.

764
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,916
I'm setting up a
dedicated dispatch, too.

765
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,719
No more listening and
driving. That's for suckers.

766
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,520
You like the Canon 305s?

767
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:25,888
Never used one.

768
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,323
Six thou a piece.

769
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:32,095
2.4 megapixels. Night vision. 18:1 zoom.

770
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:34,497
I got one of those puppies
with your name on it.

771
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:35,998
I have a camera.

772
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,767
I want you running my second van.

773
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:40,203
Two crews. Half the area to cover.

774
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:41,571
Now, I know what you're thinking.

775
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,039
Half the money, right?

776
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,108
You should be thinking, twice the sales.

777
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,442
Because we're going to be the first

778
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:47,744
at every scene.

779
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,012
Why compete when we can work together?

780
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,581
You can share my press cards.

781
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,016
Puppy dog off my police connections.

782
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:56,586
This is the big move, the next level.

783
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,221
We can corner this whole thing.

784
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:00,389
I'm talking about putting some
heavy digits in our pocket, brah.

785
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,024
Thank you for offering me the position

786
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,293
but working for myself is more in line

787
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:05,495
with my skills and career goals.

788
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:09,699
Take a few days to think about it.

789
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:10,933
No.

790
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,268
You'll need to hire someone else,

791
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,436
and I don't want to hold up the process.

792
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,471
You want to be on the
inside of this, man

793
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,307
because I'm going to be
tag-teaming every call.

794
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:21,477
You keep talking like it's something

795
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,746
that I may be interested
in, but I'm not.

796
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,948
You don't even understand the offer.

797
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,317
If you did, you'd be
fucking sucking my dick!

798
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,786
You'd be asking me questions.

799
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:31,888
What does this mean?
What does that mean?

800
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,391
I feel like grabbing you
by your ears right now

801
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:37,794
and screaming in your face,

802
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,362
"I'm not fucking interested. "

803
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,534
Instead, I'm going to drive
home and do some accounting.

804
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:50,206
Fuck you!

805
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:52,041
Twerp.

806
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,024
I didn't wake up until 5:00.

807
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:10,927
My body is so off, I feel
like it's time for breakfast.

808
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,034
I bet you're beautiful
any time of the day.

809
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,970
In fact, I'd say

810
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,772
you're much prettier than Lisa Mays.

811
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,210
I like the dark makeup on your eyes.

812
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:28,845
I also like the way you smell.

813
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,683
So, where you from, Lou?

814
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:37,453
The north end of the Valley.

815
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,990
Some of the calls sometimes
take me over there,

816
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,726
but nobody I know still lives out there.

817
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,795
You're from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

818
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:47,997
How did you know that?

819
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:49,098
It's online.

820
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,868
Everything about you is online.

821
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,303
Not everything, but definitely a lot.

822
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,239
I've watched all the videos
from when you were a reporter.

823
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,473
I'm sure you look at those, of course.

824
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,175
No. God, no.

825
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:00,309
Not without a drink in my hand.

826
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,213
I watch my work all the time.

827
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,848
Yeah? Do you want to become a reporter?

828
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,782
No.

829
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,819
Most of you guys want air time.

830
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,587
Not me.

831
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:15,024
I want to be the guy that owns
the station that owns the camera.

832
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:17,593
The business is going well,

833
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,495
but in order to grow to the next level,

834
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:20,863
I need to stay one step
ahead of my competition

835
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,265
and take risks.

836
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,300
I also need financial support
to implement expansion.

837
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:27,837
Would you like another margarita?

838
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,473
One is enough.

839
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,242
Thanks for coming out to talk.

840
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:35,778
The place I'm in now

841
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,214
is that I want a relationship

842
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,549
with someone I can team up with

843
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,519
and share, like we share, the
same job and hours and whatnot.

844
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,254
I could go down a laundry
list, but you get the idea.

845
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,889
Yes.

846
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,691
Well, I hope you find someone.

847
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,296
Here's the thing about that, Nina.

848
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:54,697
I'm quite certain I already have.

849
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,035
Okay.

850
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:02,371
Let me put this politely.

851
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,540
I only came out to dinner with you, Lou,

852
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,809
purely as a professional courtesy.

853
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:10,513
Thank you.

854
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:14,150
I don't think it's any secret

855
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:15,618
that I've single-handedly raised

856
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,986
the unit price of your ratings book.

857
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:22,792
Our ratings book price? Whoa!

858
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,162
I'm a very fast learner.

859
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:28,164
We had a conversation where
I specifically mentioned that.

860
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,031
Do you remember that?

861
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:31,734
Well, do you?

862
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,336
Yes.

863
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,504
I recently learned, for instance,

864
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:38,541
that most Americans watch
local news to stay informed.

865
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,144
I also learned that

866
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,679
the average half-hour of
Los Angeles television news

867
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,082
packs all of its local
government coverage

868
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,284
including law enforcement,
budget, transportation,

869
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,986
education and immigration

870
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,954
into 22 seconds.

871
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,757
Local crime stories, however,
not only usually led the news

872
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,425
but filled 14 times the broadcast,

873
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:57,994
averaging five minutes
and seven seconds.

874
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:01,263
KWLA relies heavily on such stories.

875
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:02,999
With Los Angeles crime rates going down,

876
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,135
I think that makes items like
mine particularly valuable.

877
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:07,770
Like rare animals.

878
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,873
I can only imagine that
your needs will increase

879
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,008
during next month's
rating sweeps period.

880
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:16,045
Ooh!

881
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,282
Yeah.

882
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:22,718
Well, we certainly
appreciate what you do.

883
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,761
There's certain good
things about being alone.

884
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,866
You have time to do
the things you wanna do,

885
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,501
like study and plan,

886
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:39,535
but you can't have dinners like this

887
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,970
or be physical with a person.

888
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:42,605
I mean, outside of flirtation-ship.

889
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:47,376
Where are you going with this?

890
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:50,880
I want that.

891
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:54,717
With you.

892
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:00,222
Like you want to keep your
job and your health insurance.

893
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,227
Look, just for starters,

894
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,931
I don't need you to keep my fucking job.

895
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,767
You're the news director
on the vampire shift

896
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,137
of the lowest-rated
station in Los Angeles.

897
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:22,745
We have what could be considered
an almost-exclusive relationship.

898
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,848
There are many other places I could go.

899
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,684
I have to think that you're
invested in this transaction.

900
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:29,752
Here you are.

901
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:30,853
Wow.

902
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,621
Enjoy. Thank you.

903
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:40,396
Where did you get the balls to
even suggest something like this?

904
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:41,864
We're still talking.

905
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:44,100
No. There's nothing more to say.

906
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,434
You can leave.

907
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,909
Okay, look.

908
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:56,812
You've done well. Okay?

909
00:51:56,814 --> 00:52:00,316
And we pay you well,
very well. We always have.

910
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,920
If you like, I could get
you an exclusive retainer.

911
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:07,156
That would be on top
of your segment fees.

912
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,592
I could maybe even get
you a job at the station

913
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,227
starting as a production assistant.

914
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,095
So that you could learn the
business from the inside.

915
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,730
That's where you said
your interests lie.

916
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,232
Mmm-hmm.

917
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,667
You're not listening, Nina.

918
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,004
I happen to know that you
haven't stayed at one station

919
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:23,939
for longer than two years at a time,

920
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:25,474
and you're coming up on two years soon.

921
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,179
I can imagine

922
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,514
that your contract is
for that length of time.

923
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:32,815
And that next month's ratings

924
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,350
directly affect that.

925
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:37,286
So, you're threatening
that if I don't...

926
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,654
I'm negotiating.

927
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,322
You're threatening
to stop selling to me.

928
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,525
That's your choice.

929
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:44,093
The true price of any item

930
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:45,694
is what somebody's
willing to pay for it.

931
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,630
You want something.

932
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,331
And I want you.

933
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,699
To fuck you.

934
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,369
And as a friend.

935
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:56,105
Jesus Christ, friends
don't pressure friends

936
00:52:56,107 --> 00:52:57,173
to fucking sleep with them.

937
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,543
Actually, that's not true, Nina.

938
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,282
Because as I'm sure you know,

939
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:10,019
a friend is a gift you give yourself.

940
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,920
Okay, a left on Roth,

941
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,422
and then six blocks to the ramp.

942
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:47,823
You're putting me on the 5?

943
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:50,259
Yeah, the 2 to the 5
to the 110 to the 10.

944
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:52,895
Did you read my traffic memo yesterday?

945
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,897
Did I read it?

946
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,398
Yeah, I read it.

947
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,434
What did it say?

948
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:00,236
About the 5?

949
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,037
Okay. I looked at it. What?

950
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,405
Well, for one thing, it included that

951
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,740
the 5 has floating construction

952
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,941
in the fast lane for
the next three weeks.

953
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,876
So, given that, I expect you to put me

954
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,945
on the 2 to the 101
to the 110 to the 10.

955
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:12,081
That's half of one, six of the other.

956
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,616
It's half dozen of
one, six of the other.

957
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,783
What I'd like you to do is admit that

958
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,418
you didn't read what you said you did.

959
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,920
You know I'm a reasonable person,

960
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,588
but nobody likes to be lied to!

961
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,757
Okay! When am I going to get my raise?

962
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,192
That's reasonable, right?

963
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:24,927
You keep talking about
this performance review.

964
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,028
When is it gonna happen?

965
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,630
I've been out here two months already,

966
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,131
busting my ass every night.

967
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,400
I'm tired of your
promises for more pay, man.

968
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,601
I'm sleeping in a garage.

969
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,536
Rick, trying to leverage your salary

970
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,405
in this economic environment
is near impossible.

971
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:38,240
Most firms have set starting wages.

972
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,409
Ideally, you could
leverage with other offers,

973
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:41,610
but that's just not the case

974
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,045
in your situation right now.

975
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:44,546
<i>Test 498.</i>

976
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:45,981
<i>Engine 91. North division. Battalion 12.</i>

977
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:47,383
<i>Heavy rescue. 56.</i>

978
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:48,784
<i>Air ops respond. Reported plane down.</i>

979
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:49,718
<i>Whiteman Field, south of Foothill.</i>

980
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,420
Reroute us to that.

981
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:53,489
We're 22 minutes from Foothill,

982
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,090
and only five from a hit and run.

983
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:56,659
They're rolling heavy
rescue and an air ambulance.

984
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:58,327
Get me there, please.

985
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:16,679
It's good right there.
Stay on that spot.

986
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,414
Not getting through here.

987
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:21,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's
all over here, buddy.

988
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:22,985
Turn it around, let's go.

989
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,589
You're late.

990
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:31,093
Hey, brah!

991
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:34,163
Five fatals. Come screaming
out of the fucking sky.

992
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:35,931
All lit up with the brush on fire.

993
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:39,335
Mine. Exclusive. I'm banging!

994
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:44,106
And my other van is in
Carson, getting the jumper.

995
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:46,141
You know...

996
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:48,677
I was trying to hook you up, man.

997
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,546
I was trying to teach you something.

998
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:55,617
Welcome to the future, brah.

999
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,469
A car crash.

1000
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:16,305
Well, none of this is
gonna knock anybody out.

1001
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:17,906
I can't use any of this in my rundown.

1002
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:19,808
Is this it?

1003
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,911
No, I have a stabbing in Corona.

1004
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,980
Where's the plane crash at Foothill?

1005
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:26,915
I don't mind saying that I'm
trying to bring you stories

1006
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,384
that happen here on the ground.

1007
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:30,919
Two has it. It'll be their lead.

1008
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:32,354
Well, I hope that works well for them.

1009
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:34,156
Now, let me show you
the stabbing in Corona.

1010
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:37,526
I don't give a goddamn
about fucking Corona!

1011
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:39,361
You know how important this week is.

1012
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:42,531
This shit is fucking death to me!

1013
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:43,999
I understand your frustration.

1014
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,201
I was just trying not
to be too hard on myself.

1015
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:49,271
I sold you upstairs as some
kind of fucking sweeps savior.

1016
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:52,274
And I'm leading with a goddamn stabbing.

1017
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:53,409
In Corona!

1018
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:55,411
So, you want that, then?

1019
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,746
I want you to get in the goddamn game!

1020
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,115
I want something people
can't turn away from.

1021
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:02,184
I want what you fucking promised me!

1022
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,632
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

1023
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,133
<i>Thanks for joining us. I'm Pat Harvey.</i>

1024
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:20,068
<i>Hope your day's getting off to
a good start. I'm Kent Shocknek.</i>

1025
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,770
<i>We begin with a tragedy last night</i>

1026
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,439
<i>in the foothills of Santa Susana Pass</i>

1027
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:26,241
<i>where a private plane
crashed with no survivors.</i>

1028
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,811
<i>CBS2 has obtained this exclusive video.</i>

1029
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:30,145
<i>We want to remind you now</i>

1030
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:32,147
<i>that what you're about
to see is graphic,</i>

1031
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:33,782
<i>and viewer discretion is advised.</i>

1032
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:35,544
Since when did Coldwater
become faster than Laurel?

1033
00:58:35,546 --> 00:58:38,814
Huh? What was the thinking there?

1034
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,482
I didn't ask that to hear myself speak.

1035
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:43,485
Because, you know, Coldwater
only has six lights.

1036
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:44,786
Laurel has places to pass.

1037
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:47,356
I can't get around this
person until Ventura.

1038
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:49,725
It's the same argument,
man. I said this route.

1039
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,026
If you wanted to take Laurel,

1040
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,294
you should have said something.

1041
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:53,662
I thought that you
worked in other factors.

1042
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:55,297
If I didn't think that
you could do better,

1043
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:57,232
I wouldn't ride you so
hard about the routes.

1044
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:58,834
I think you know that, Rick.

1045
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:00,335
I think it may just be possible

1046
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:03,171
that I have a higher opinion of
you than you have of yourself.

1047
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:04,573
What the fuck?

1048
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,707
God damn it!

1049
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,278
Seriously?

1050
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:12,681
To get to a van crash on Moorpark?

1051
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:15,150
Who cares? What's the rush?

1052
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:18,220
Why aren't we at the rape at
Griffith Park like everybody else?

1053
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:28,363
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck me.

1054
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:31,166
Oh, God! That's the fucking Mayhem van.

1055
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:32,668
Joe Loder and the other dude.

1056
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,103
What's his name? Fucking Marcus.

1057
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,072
Park the car and get your camera.

1058
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:42,377
Now, let's get one guy
inside. Hold the seats back.

1059
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:43,545
You can't get that in right there?

1060
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,447
No, there's no room.

1061
00:59:47,518 --> 00:59:49,351
Here we go.

1062
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,558
What the hell happened?

1063
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,761
According to witnesses, they were
driving at a high rate of speed,

1064
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,630
probably toward Griffith Park,

1065
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:03,532
when, apparently, they ran
head-on into this light pole.

1066
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:05,100
No other car. Single vehicle.

1067
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,770
How did they just run into a pole?

1068
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,811
Get that backboard right up against him.

1069
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:17,245
Easy.

1070
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:19,448
Hey, don't film that,
man. He's one of us.

1071
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,949
Not anymore, Rick.

1072
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,618
We're professionals.

1073
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:25,087
He's a sale.

1074
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:28,290
Got facial trauma. Got
lacerations all the way down...

1075
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,559
Yeah, I'm calling it in.

1076
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:31,927
Minimize that movement.

1077
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:34,429
Get him back in the ambulance
and put some oxygen on him.

1078
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,998
Drop him down. Keep pressure on him.

1079
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Back that unit off.

1080
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:40,002
Yeah, let's get some
four-by-fours on there.

1081
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:42,604
Bring the gurney all the way up.

1082
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:44,806
Come on, let's go.

1083
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,174
Stay with me.

1084
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:48,076
I got him, I got him.

1085
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:49,978
Make sure you size him
right. MAN 3: All right.

1086
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,274
Man, we are way the hell out here.

1087
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:28,050
<i>Any Mission unit.</i>

1088
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:29,785
<i>Residential 211 in progress.</i>

1089
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,486
<i>37 Bonhill Road.</i>

1090
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:33,355
<i>Receiving 211 siren activation.</i>

1091
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:36,558
Armed response on a home invasion.

1092
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,460
We're five blocks away. Pull a U-turn.

1093
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:51,707
At the end of the street. Coming up.

1094
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,742
4808. Here!

1095
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,549
We beat the police.

1096
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,718
What do you want me to do?
You know what to do, Rick!

1097
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:30,799
<i>3-X-21.
Go ahead.</i>

1098
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,567
<i>3-X-21,
confirm address</i>

1099
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:34,069
<i>on the 211 at Bonhill Road.</i>

1100
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,699
What is going on?

1101
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:39,567
We're leaving. What?

1102
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:41,970
What's in there? What's going on?

1103
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:43,138
What happened in there?

1104
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,272
You should have walked
in and looked, Rick,

1105
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,573
if you're that curious.

1106
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:46,708
That's what I'm paying you to do.

1107
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,943
You need to show initiative.

1108
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,278
There is no better way
to achieve job security

1109
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,647
than by making yourself
an indispensable employee.

1110
01:05:52,649 --> 01:05:53,982
I heard gunshots!

1111
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:56,117
All the more reason you
might have helped me.

1112
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,086
You might have learned a new
skill that made you more useful

1113
01:05:58,088 --> 01:05:59,554
and put us on a track toward growth!

1114
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:38,827
Stay in the car.

1115
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,562
Why? Because I said so.

1116
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:30,211
We have a hit-and-run
in Beverly Hills,

1117
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,014
a car versus pedestrian
incident and a robbery.

1118
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:34,215
Do we have footage of the crash?

1119
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,116
Surveillance footage.

1120
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,857
I've been trying to reach
you for the last hour.

1121
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:44,726
In the future, when
you don't have anything,

1122
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,162
man up and don't dodge my fucking calls.

1123
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:48,897
I do have something.

1124
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:51,332
What?

1125
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:54,536
Home invasion, triple
murder in Granada Hills.

1126
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:55,670
That's just breaking now.

1127
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:57,272
We got there before the police.

1128
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:01,142
You have it?

1129
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:07,449
I'm not going to list the
many benefits of this piece.

1130
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:10,118
I think it's probably best if
you just watch it for yourself.

1131
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,686
I could have had
someone out there by now.

1132
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,288
Why didn't you call it in?

1133
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,290
To increase your need, and
improve my bargaining position.

1134
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:18,827
Frank, Jenny! Bay 2, now!

1135
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:50,058
Get Linda in here.

1136
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,403
Home invasion in Granada.

1137
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:03,805
He got there before the cops.

1138
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:04,939
We have 10 minutes to airtime.

1139
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:06,341
How much of this can we show?

1140
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,010
You mean, legally?

1141
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:11,346
No, morally. Of course, legally.

1142
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:12,580
Have they been identified?

1143
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,282
It just happened, so
you have to assume no,

1144
01:09:14,284 --> 01:09:15,917
and that's just one of the issues.

1145
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,418
We can't broadcast their identities

1146
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,853
without notifying the next of kin.

1147
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,255
We're not identifying them.

1148
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:22,157
You are by proxy, by
showing their faces.

1149
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,025
We pixelate the faces.

1150
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:25,093
Where did you get this?

1151
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:26,427
Stringer.

1152
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:27,996
Hi, Linda. I'm Lou.

1153
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,465
Um, Jesus. Is there a
dead baby inside of there?

1154
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:32,000
No. The crib was empty.

1155
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:33,101
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1156
01:09:33,103 --> 01:09:34,769
Are we breaking the law by showing this?

1157
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,041
Block the faces, don't
give out the exact address.

1158
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:43,511
Do that, I guess. I don't know.

1159
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,313
I wouldn't think so, no.

1160
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:46,447
Journalistically and ethically?

1161
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:47,515
This isn't Hartford.

1162
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,617
We are beyond all broadcast standards.

1163
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:51,619
Have you seen the overnights?

1164
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,454
I'll risk the fine.

1165
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:54,822
What did you pay for this?

1166
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:56,858
The price hasn't been negotiated yet.

1167
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:58,993
Give us a minute.

1168
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,094
Thanks.

1169
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:07,535
How much? $100,000.

1170
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,238
How much? $50,000.

1171
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,307
I need a number. Nine
minutes. I need a number.

1172
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:13,675
I just gave you two.

1173
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,076
$3,000.

1174
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:16,711
I got $3,000 for the
food truck stabbings.

1175
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,346
There were more dead.

1176
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:20,215
Those were poor Mexican
people in a roach coach.

1177
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:21,549
Two of them were illegals.

1178
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,917
These are three wealthy white people,

1179
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,519
shot and killed in their mansion.

1180
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:27,222
Including a suburban housewife
shotgunned in her bed.

1181
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:28,856
I know you, Nina.

1182
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,258
I know your interest and
excitement in this product

1183
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,759
is greater than the
amount you're offering.

1184
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:41,569
$5,000. $30,000.

1185
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:42,503
$7,000. $25,000.

1186
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:43,571
$8,000. $15,000.

1187
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,806
$9,000. $15,000.

1188
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,175
$10,000. $15,000.

1189
01:10:47,177 --> 01:10:48,843
Give me a serious number.

1190
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,411
$15,000.

1191
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,913
Can't do it. Never happen.
There's a matter of precedent.

1192
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:53,548
Ten is my last best offer.

1193
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,649
Okay.

1194
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,118
Really?

1195
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,287
Where are you going?

1196
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:01,856
Seven has approached me
at least several times.

1197
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,524
The ND there gave me his number.

1198
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:05,426
They'll make me a better
offer. It's a five-minute drive.

1199
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,961
Hold on!

1200
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:15,436
Twelve.

1201
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,871
Fifteen.

1202
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:19,707
I can't spend a month's
budget on a single story.

1203
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:20,608
What if the story's not over?

1204
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:23,878
The people who did this escaped.

1205
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,448
They're still out there, walking
around with the rest of us.

1206
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,385
If I had a family and I lived in
a home, that might make me nervous.

1207
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:32,587
I'd want updates on what was going on.

1208
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,689
With this footage, people would
turn to your channel for the story.

1209
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:37,959
I like you, Nina.

1210
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,727
And I look forward to our time together.

1211
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:41,329
But you have to understand.

1212
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:44,265
$15,000 isn't all that I want.

1213
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:46,301
From here on, starting now,

1214
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:48,903
I want my work to be credited
by the anchors and on a burn.

1215
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:50,405
The name of my company is

1216
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:53,508
Video Production News, a
professional news-gathering service.

1217
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:54,609
That's how it should be read

1218
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:56,511
and that's how it should be said.

1219
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,681
I also want to go to the
next rung, and meet your team.

1220
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:01,816
And the station manager and
the director and the anchors.

1221
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,951
And start developing my
own personal relationships.

1222
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,653
I'd like to start
meeting them this morning.

1223
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,655
You'll take me around, you'll
introduce me as the owner and President

1224
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,190
of Video Production News

1225
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:12,160
and remind them of some
of my many other stories.

1226
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:13,428
I'm not done.

1227
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,863
I also want to stop our
discussion over prices.

1228
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:16,998
This will save time.

1229
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,299
When I say that a particular number

1230
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:20,001
is my lowest price,
that's my lowest price.

1231
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,202
And you can be assured that I arrived

1232
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:23,371
at whatever that number
is very carefully.

1233
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:27,942
Now, when I say that
I want these things,

1234
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,044
I mean that I want them.

1235
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,946
And I don't want to have to ask again.

1236
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,614
And the last thing that I want, Nina,

1237
01:12:33,616 --> 01:12:35,350
is for you to do the
things that I ask you to do

1238
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:36,718
when we're alone together
in your apartment.

1239
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,086
Not like the last time!

1240
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:43,358
So...

1241
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:47,295
I'll tell you what.

1242
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:50,365
I have the van crash
on Moorpark tonight.

1243
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:52,200
It was a couple of stringers, actually.

1244
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:53,968
That could lead by itself
on an average night.

1245
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:56,204
I'd be willing to
throw that in for free.

1246
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:01,609
So what do you say, do we have a deal?

1247
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:07,849
Lisa Mays, Ben Waterman, Lou Bloom.

1248
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:10,084
Hi. Hello. How are you, Lisa?

1249
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:12,687
You remember Lou from
the Benedict Canyon crash.

1250
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:14,088
Oh, yeah. Amazing stuff.

1251
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,357
That was my company,
Video Production News.

1252
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:17,859
I would just like to say

1253
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:21,362
that I think that what the two
of you do is incredibly valuable.

1254
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:22,897
Thank you. That's nice of you to say.

1255
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,665
We appreciate it.

1256
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:25,733
I don't know how long

1257
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,368
this tape runs, we might dump out.

1258
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:29,237
Twenty seconds to back. Ben
and Lisa, 20 seconds to back.

1259
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:31,672
Set up a sting dig,
Camera Two on a two-shot.

1260
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:32,774
Where's the banner?

1261
01:13:32,776 --> 01:13:33,775
Did we decide on one?

1262
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:34,876
Horror House.

1263
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:36,444
What did we talk about?

1264
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:38,179
Can you build that? Put it on CG-one.

1265
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:39,380
Back in 10 seconds.

1266
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:42,884
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1267
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:45,920
five, four, three,

1268
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,756
two, one. Sting it.

1269
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,860
Mics. Dissolve. Cue.

1270
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:55,263
<i>Hello, everybody. This is
KWLA with breaking news.</i>

1271
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:58,083
<i>Over the last half-hour or so,</i>

1272
01:13:58,084 --> 01:14:00,902
<i>we've now received word of an
apparent home invasion triple homicide</i>

1273
01:14:00,904 --> 01:14:03,204
<i>in the Granada Hills area
of the San Fernando Valley.</i>

1274
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:05,206
<i>Now, at present, the
number of those dead...</i>

1275
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,474
Preset Camera Two.

1276
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:07,741
<i>...have not been
confirmed yet by the police</i>

1277
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:10,311
<i>but KWLA has obtained exclusive footage</i>

1278
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:12,547
<i>from inside the crime scene</i>

1279
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:14,816
<i>in which at least three
bodies can be observed.</i>

1280
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:17,318
<i>Now, we're going to show
you segments of that footage</i>

1281
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,953
<i>throughout the rest of this broadcast,</i>

1282
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,655
<i>but also throughout the day.</i>

1283
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:22,056
Ben, Lisa, I have a tape.
When you're ready, throw to it.

1284
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:24,258
I'll follow you.

1285
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,562
<i>Again, we're about to show
you exclusive KWLA video</i>

1286
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:29,297
<i>from inside the actual crime scene.</i>

1287
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:30,631
It's graphic. Repeat it.

1288
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,733
<i>And before broadcasting this video,</i>

1289
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:36,737
<i>we want to warn our viewers that
these are extremely graphic images.</i>

1290
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:39,273
<i>And I'm hearing from our control
room that we have that video,</i>

1291
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:41,142
<i>and we're going to show it now.</i>

1292
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:44,312
<i>This is footage that we have
obtained exclusively by KWLA</i>

1293
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:45,947
<i>from Video Production News.</i>

1294
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:48,082
<i>This is a professional
news-gathering service.</i>

1295
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:50,284
<i>This is what appears to be a shotgun,</i>

1296
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:52,653
<i>something you might
use for home defense.</i>

1297
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:53,988
<i>You can see the pistol grips</i>

1298
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,456
<i>on the front and the back there.</i>

1299
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,158
<i>Quite possibly the murder weapon.</i>

1300
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,994
<i>And now, Lisa, as we move
inside, this is a beautiful home.</i>

1301
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,597
<i>A beautiful home in a
very safe neighborhood.</i>

1302
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:04,432
<i>Or, what most people think
is a safe neighborhood.</i>

1303
01:15:04,434 --> 01:15:07,368
<i>It appears that that is the first body.</i>

1304
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,537
<i>A young woman, I'm
guessing, from this angle.</i>

1305
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:11,539
<i>A young woman on a sofa, there.</i>

1306
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:14,342
<i>All of the faces, though,
have been blurred out.</i>

1307
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:15,776
They've escaped. They're on the loose.

1308
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:17,845
<i>That is the first of what we understand</i>

1309
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:20,381
<i>are three bodies in the
home in Granada Hills.</i>

1310
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:23,217
<i>And this was committed
by a suspect, or suspects</i>

1311
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:24,986
<i>who are still out there.</i>

1312
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,954
<i>They're believed to have escaped.</i>

1313
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:29,156
<i>And if you think about that, that
is a very frightening thought.</i>

1314
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:30,491
Repeat that.

1315
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:32,360
<i>Yes, scary, and very concerning,</i>

1316
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:34,128
<i>particularly given what
we're looking at here.</i>

1317
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,497
<i>The savagery of what
these pictures show.</i>

1318
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:38,199
<i>And now, look, there on the floor.</i>

1319
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:41,002
<i>Lisa, what is that? A
bloodied article of clothing?</i>

1320
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:42,303
<i>It looks like a silk shirt.</i>

1321
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:43,905
<i>Maybe a woman's silk blouse.</i>

1322
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:45,573
<i>It's just so sad.</i>

1323
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:47,808
Stand by to dissolve, Two.

1324
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,011
<i>And, obviously, there
is the second body.</i>

1325
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:51,746
<i>They've escaped. Repeat it.
- The person or people</i>

1326
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:54,415
<i>who committed all of this
brutal home invasion robbery,</i>

1327
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:57,685
<i>they're presently unidentified
and at large, still on the streets.</i>

1328
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:59,020
Hit it again. Harder.

1329
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:00,755
<i>This has got to be a huge worry</i>

1330
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:02,390
<i>not only to the residents
in this neighborhood,</i>

1331
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:03,724
<i>the Granada Hills area as well.</i>

1332
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,743
<i>All of Los Angeles,
if you think about it.</i>

1333
01:16:05,744 --> 01:16:07,761
<i>Yeah, the entire Southland,
really. Tonight, absolutely.</i>

1334
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:10,398
<i>An apparent family
attacked, savagely killed.</i>

1335
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,733
<i>We believe this is their own home.</i>

1336
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,769
<i>In what is one of the quieter,</i>

1337
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:17,838
<i>I think a frankly more upscale
and affluent neighborhoods</i>

1338
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,073
<i>in the whole Valley.</i>

1339
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,908
<i>In all of Los Angeles.</i>

1340
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,010
<i>And now, as we're
moving, this is a nursery.</i>

1341
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:24,412
<i>And you hope to God... Build it.</i>

1342
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:26,847
<i>...that there's not a baby in that crib.</i>

1343
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:29,216
<i>Yeah, you're just praying
that that crib is empty.</i>

1344
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:31,419
<i>Because this is
definitely a child's room.</i>

1345
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:34,221
<i>And, now, as we look, thank
goodness. Absolutely great.</i>

1346
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:35,856
<i>In fact, our understanding right now</i>

1347
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,858
<i>is that there was no
baby found in the house.</i>

1348
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,393
<i>Or any baby that was seen at all</i>

1349
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:41,028
<i>by the people who filmed this for us.</i>

1350
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,196
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

1351
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:43,898
<i>That's Video News,</i>

1352
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,701
<i>this is a professional
news-gathering service that we use.</i>

1353
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:48,769
<i>Apparently, what we're
hearing from their photographer</i>

1354
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:52,239
<i>is that they arrived even
before the police did.</i>

1355
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:54,241
<i>And then entered this home to help,</i>

1356
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,577
<i>or at least offer
some sort of assistance</i>

1357
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:58,412
<i>and then came upon what
you're looking at here.</i>

1358
01:16:58,414 --> 01:17:00,948
<i>They came upon three bodies.</i>

1359
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,051
<i>And that, right there is
the third body on the floor.</i>

1360
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,821
<i>This is a man, gray hair. What would
you think, Lisa? Maybe 40s, 50s?</i>

1361
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:08,155
<i>Yeah, 50s. Maybe even 60s.</i>

1362
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:10,625
"Vicious attack. "

1363
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:12,460
<i>We've been looking at
all this graphic footage</i>

1364
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:14,762
<i>and just the viciousness,
the severity of violence.</i>

1365
01:17:14,764 --> 01:17:16,397
Master control, we're
going to come to a break.

1366
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:19,066
We're going to commercial, then
cutting to Joel and a police statement.

1367
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:20,468
<i>I'm getting word right now that police</i>

1368
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:23,070
<i>are getting ready to issue a statement</i>

1369
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:26,007
<i>from the scene and Joel
Beatty is there for that.</i>

1370
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:28,075
<i>Right now, we're going
to take a quick break.</i>

1371
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,511
Ready to break in five, four...

1372
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:31,612
Sneak in your music.

1373
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:33,781
Three, two, one.

1374
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:35,850
Fade to black. Roll your break.

1375
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:36,951
That's a 10-share.

1376
01:17:38,588 --> 01:17:39,954
I want theme music on the return,

1377
01:17:39,956 --> 01:17:42,123
the cut we used for the Simi rail crash.

1378
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,291
Audio, cut 32, please.
Cut 32 when we come back.

1379
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:50,197
Hello?

1380
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:51,332
Rolling with your banner.

1381
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:52,533
Thank you.

1382
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:55,936
Actually, he'd like to meet you.

1383
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,938
Come back, One, and key on Ben.

1384
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,774
<i>Hey, heads up, you guys.
The police spokesman</i>

<i>from the police out

1388
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:08,816
Tell them to call the station.

1389
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:10,384
Fifteen seconds.

1390
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:12,553
<i>They want to talk to the
person who shot it. I shot it.</i>

1391

Joel, it's Video Production News.

1392
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:15,990
Tell them to call me.

1393
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:17,525
Lou, they can't hear you.

1394
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,393
Coming back in five,

1395
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:23,330
four, three, two, one.

1396
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:24,665
Fade up.

<i>We have more information coming
in from the Granada Hills area</i>

1400
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:38,212
<i>and their housekeeper...</i>

1401
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,513
<i>What we know at the moment is that</i>

1402
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:41,315
<i>at some time around 5:00 this morning,</i>

1403
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:43,551
<i>gunmen broke into this upscale...</i>

1404
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:46,520
<i>Residents are disturbed and concerned
by the brutal triple murder...</i>

1405
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:48,489
<i>The way we got it, though,
is a video production crew</i>

1406
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:50,191
<i>that we work with from time to time.</i>

1407
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:51,692
<i>They, apparently, arrived on the scene</i>

1408
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:53,661
<i>in Granada Hills before
the police got there.</i>

1409
01:18:53,663 --> 01:18:54,829
<i>Before anybody.</i>

1410
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:57,031
<i>The photographer who took those pictures</i>

1411
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:59,500
<i>told us earlier that he
walked up to the door,</i>

1412
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:02,203
<i>he saw what we all saw in his videotape.</i>

1413
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:05,272
<i>And then he started to look
inside, so that he could help</i>

1414
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:07,007
<i>or render assistance to someone.</i>

1415
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:08,342
<i>That's when he walked into the house</i>

1416
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:10,277
<i>and started shooting the video.</i>

1417
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,279
<i>He found the three
deceased in the house.</i>

1418
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:13,481
<i>The two females and the one...</i>

1419
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,928
Hello. Hi.

1420
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,431
I'm Detective Frontieri. This is
my partner, Detective Lieberman.

1421
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:31,599
Are you Louis Bloom?

1422
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,200
Yes, I'm Lou.

1423
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,236
You live here? Yes, that's right.

1424
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:36,704
May we come inside?

1425
01:19:36,706 --> 01:19:37,972
Why? Why not?

1426
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,207
You want to? Yes.

1427
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:41,375
I don't care.

1428
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:42,543
Wonderful.

1429
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,650
You were in Granada Hills last night.

1430
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:51,218
Yes, that's right.

1431
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,820
You shot the video in the house?

1432
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:55,122
Yes, ma'am, I did. That's right.

1433
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,526
You went inside the house? You
filmed all through the house?

1434
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:00,361
You even filmed the bodies.

1435
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:02,730
All before the police came.

1436
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:03,731
That door was open, ma'am.

1437
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:05,132
Detective.

1438
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:08,068
The door was open and what I did was

1439
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,470
I went in to see if I could help,

1440
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,938
because the alarm was ringing.

1441
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,473
An active crime scene.

1442
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:13,908
I didn't know it was a crime scene.

1443
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,911
You knew what it was.

1444
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:19,013
I know that an alarm means
someone is in trouble.

1445
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:21,816
And you sold it to be shown on TV.

1446
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:23,851
We're a professional
news-gathering service.

1447
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:26,020
What did you see when you arrived?

1448
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,355
Uh, two men leaving in a vehicle.

1449
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,124
You saw two men?

1450
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,827
They were just shapes,
really. I was afraid, so I hid.

1451
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,428
And then I saw the shapes of two men

1452
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:36,630
moving inside the
vehicle, if that helps.

1453
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:37,932
Describe the men.

1454
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:39,200
It was dark.

1455
01:20:39,202 --> 01:20:41,001
And then they drove away.

1456
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,870
Black? White? Tall? I couldn't see.

1457
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:44,004
What were they driving?

1458
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,272
An SUV.

1459
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,441
Dark-colored.

1460
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:49,276
Rims? Tinted windows?

1461
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:51,846
Maybe. Not that I saw.

1462
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:54,448
Do you have any film
on the men or the car?

1463
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,617
No, I don't. I only started
filming when I was inside.

1464
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,485
Mmm-hmm.

1465
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:00,654
I'd like a copy of that footage.

1466
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:02,823
Do I have to give it to you?

1467
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:05,159
Is there any reason why you wouldn't?

1468
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,995
No, no, I made you a copy.
I expected someone to come.

1469
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:18,999
What's up, man?

1470
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:22,870
I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

1471
01:22:22,872 --> 01:22:25,372
Why are we starting so early?

1472
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:28,609
One of the people in the
house last night was alive.

1473
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:32,646
I cut that part out.

1474
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:34,415
I also cut out the men
leaving in their car.

1475
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:36,650
I have a name and an address.
We're gonna drive there.

1476
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:41,522
We're gonna find the
person that drove that car.

1477
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,056
So you know who killed those people?

1478
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:44,625
One of them, quite possibly, yes.

1479
01:22:46,162 --> 01:22:47,962
You gotta call the cops.

1480
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,396
And we will, at the right time.

1481
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,642
I'm offering you a real
opportunity here, Rick.

1482
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:03,711
To do what?

1483
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,249
I don't usually share my
business plan with you.

1484
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,655
But a moment has arrived
that could allow the company

1485
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,424
to make enough money to
expand to the next level.

1486
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:20,661
We could call this

1487
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:26,934
the critical moment.

1488
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:28,869
I'm inviting you, Rick,
to be a part of the team

1489
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:31,839
that pounces on this opportunity.

1490
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:33,273
You've been asking a lot
about your performance review.

1491
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:35,142
Yeah.

1492
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:36,243
Well.

1493
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:39,446
For starters,

1494
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:40,714
I've been seeing a great improvement

1495
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:42,716
in your overall focus
and order-following.

1496
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:46,487
Given complex problems, you're
developing a real ability

1497
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:48,722
to find clear and simple solutions.

1498
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:51,025
I'm also aware of your
increased enthusiasm.

1499
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:52,126
It's great to see your eyes light up

1500
01:23:52,128 --> 01:23:53,293
when you're working on a new idea.

1501
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:55,062
I hope you'll be inspiring us

1502
01:23:55,064 --> 01:23:58,265
with your innovative
thinking for years to come.

1503
01:23:59,802 --> 01:24:02,603
Thank you, man. I'm trying. You know?

1504
01:24:03,873 --> 01:24:06,306
Which is why I'm promoting you

1505
01:24:06,308 --> 01:24:10,377
to Executive Vice
President of Video News.

1506
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:14,715
What am I now?

1507
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:17,785
You're an assistant.

1508
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:22,122
That's... Big.

1509
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:28,996
Does it come with a raise?

1510
01:24:28,998 --> 01:24:30,697
Absolutely.

1511
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:32,733
How much?

1512
01:24:34,003 --> 01:24:36,770
Pick a number. You pick a number.

1513
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,610
A...

1514
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:49,416
$75 a night?

1515
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,019
Agreed.

1516
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,790
What about more? You know?

1517
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,258
Not now.

1518
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,160
We closed the deal.

1519
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,132
I could have gotten more, couldn't I?

1520
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:06,767
Absolutely.

1521
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:11,905
All right. It's coming up on the left.

1522
01:25:11,907 --> 01:25:15,442
Halfway down the
block. 1701 North Burns.

1523
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:28,222
Is that the car? That's the car.

1524
01:25:28,224 --> 01:25:29,289
Oh, shit.

1525
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:52,846
Do you think there's a reward?

1526
01:25:52,848 --> 01:25:54,481
There is a reward.

1527
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,683
How much? $50,000.

1528
01:25:58,254 --> 01:25:59,686
Do I get any of that?

1529
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:00,854
I just gave you a raise.

1530
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:05,459
That's salary. I mean, a bonus.

1531
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:07,761
Bonuses come at the end of the year.

1532
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:17,604
So, we're gonna call it in?

1533
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:19,873
We're gonna wait. For what?

1534
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:21,775
First, we want to see
if he's actually inside.

1535
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:24,111
And then, we want to find a more
interesting place to film the arrest.

1536
01:26:25,314 --> 01:26:26,180
Like where?

1537
01:26:29,318 --> 01:26:31,151
Anywhere we want.

1538
01:26:31,153 --> 01:26:32,686
What we're going to
do, is we're gonna wait

1539
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,955
and then we're gonna follow him.

1540
01:26:34,957 --> 01:26:36,223
Then, when he reaches
what would be considered

1541
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:37,991
a better or more populated neighborhood,

1542
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:39,960
then we'll report his
location to the police.

1543
01:26:39,962 --> 01:26:41,495
He's a violent, wanted criminal.

1544
01:26:41,497 --> 01:26:42,563
I can't believe

1545
01:26:42,565 --> 01:26:44,231
that he's just going
to peacefully surrender.

1546
01:26:51,307 --> 01:26:52,873
Okay. I want more money.

1547
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:54,942
A lot more.

1548
01:27:04,353 --> 01:27:06,220
What makes a job desirable, Rick,

1549
01:27:06,222 --> 01:27:08,355
isn't just the dollar
amount attached to it.

1550
01:27:08,357 --> 01:27:10,591
You're at the ground floor
of a growing business.

1551
01:27:10,593 --> 01:27:11,758
Your reward is a career.

1552
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,093
Fuck that.

1553
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:15,362
You're talking about some
seriously messed-up shit.

1554
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:17,030
You're expecting me

1555
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:19,933
to just go along with it. I want more.

1556
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:21,368
I can't make people do things, Rick.

1557
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,836
You have a choice if you wanna do this.

1558
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:24,304
And I have a choice if you don't.

1559
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:27,975
Are you threatening to fire me?

1560
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:30,711
Hey, I... I got something, too.

1561
01:27:30,713 --> 01:27:32,279
How about not calling in criminals,

1562
01:27:32,281 --> 01:27:34,781
waiting for them to start
some shit so you can film it?

1563
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:36,383
That's against the fucking law.

1564
01:27:36,385 --> 01:27:39,686
Yeah, cops would be majorly
interested in that, no doubt.

1565
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:42,356
Okay? So, I... I want more money.

1566
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:47,461
We can re-open negotiations, Rick.

1567
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:49,763
But, remember,

1568
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:51,431
when it comes to your work reputation,

1569
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:54,067
you can't un-ring the bell.

1570
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:55,969
I want half of whatever we make tonight.

1571
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:58,872
How did you arrive at that number?

1572
01:27:59,808 --> 01:28:02,209
There's two of us out here.

1573
01:28:02,211 --> 01:28:04,244
So, 50-50.

1574
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:06,313
I'll counter at $10,000.

1575
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:07,748
You don't set the numbers on this.

1576
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,950
I want half. I want half.

1577
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:12,786
If you're saying I can't negotiate,

1578
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:14,288
then I guess I'm...

1579
01:28:22,164 --> 01:28:24,631
I'm just gonna have to give it to you.

1580
01:28:27,603 --> 01:28:29,403
Well, all right, then.

1581
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:30,904
Oh...

1582
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:32,773
Now I can feel good about it, at least.

1583
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:35,008
Now, I'll go the extra mile.

1584
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:37,844
That's what you never understood, man.

1585
01:28:37,846 --> 01:28:39,046
It's been the problem the whole time.

1586
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:43,917
You gotta bring people
in, Lou. Seriously.

1587
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:46,787
You gotta talk to them like
they're fucking human beings.

1588
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,188
I'm saying this for you, dude.

1589
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:50,791
For the future, to help you.

1590
01:28:50,793 --> 01:28:53,093
Because you got a seriously
weird-ass way of looking at shit.

1591
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,997
You know you do!

1592
01:28:56,999 --> 01:28:58,432
You know what your trouble is, man?

1593
01:28:58,434 --> 01:28:59,933
You don't fucking understand people.

1594
01:29:02,471 --> 01:29:03,570
Okay?

1595
01:29:04,306 --> 01:29:05,339
Mmm-hmm.

1596
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,542
I'll take the first watch.

1597
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:11,078
Okay.

1598
01:29:35,471 --> 01:29:36,770
Rise and shine.

1599
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,339
He's leaving.

1600
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:43,577
Is that him?

1601
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:45,278
That's one of them.

1602
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:30,223
You're too fucking close, man.

1603
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:32,159
Oh, shit.

1604
01:30:33,095 --> 01:30:34,694
You're too fucking close.

1605
01:30:34,696 --> 01:30:36,129
This guy might have already seen us,

1606
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:38,165
and he's bringing us here as a trap.

1607
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,201
You ever think of that?

1608
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:47,174
Oh, shit.

1609
01:31:26,748 --> 01:31:29,749
They're gonna see us.
We're in a red fucking car.

1610
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,488
Lower your window, please.

1611
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:04,985
Keep your window down.

1612
01:32:04,987 --> 01:32:07,087
I'm fucking cold.

1613
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:18,265
Shit, they're parking.

1614
01:32:19,067 --> 01:32:20,734
Keep going.

1615
01:32:39,154 --> 01:32:40,353
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

1616
01:32:40,355 --> 01:32:41,488
Uh, yes, good evening.

1617
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:43,256
I'd like to report
the location of two men

1618
01:32:43,258 --> 01:32:46,526
responsible for the triple murder
in Granada Hills last night.

1619
01:32:46,528 --> 01:32:47,694
<i>What's your address?</i>

1620
01:32:47,696 --> 01:32:49,563
Uh, I followed them,

1621
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:51,731
and they just pulled into the
Chinatown Express at Western and Third.

1622
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:53,567
Um, I can see them inside.

1623
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:55,669
<i>Okay, it's a restaurant
called Chinatown Express</i>

1624
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:57,170
<i>at Western and Third.</i>

1625
01:32:57,172 --> 01:32:59,739
That's right. I can see them at
the counter and they're ordering.

1626
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:02,008
These men are wanted for the triple
murder in Granada Hills last night.

1627
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:04,077
<i>What's your name, sir? Louis Bloom.</i>

1628
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:05,712
<i>Do you have a description of the men?</i>

1629
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:07,447
Uh, yes, I do. They're
both Latin American men.

1630
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:10,417
Uh, probably what you
would call Hispanic.

1631
01:33:10,419 --> 01:33:13,353
Uh, one is big, very
much on the heavy side.

1632
01:33:13,355 --> 01:33:14,421
And the other's face is scratched.

1633
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:16,222
He has scratches on his face.

1634
01:33:16,224 --> 01:33:17,324
<i>How old are the men?</i>

1635
01:33:18,427 --> 01:33:22,429
Uh, thirty. Perhaps, maybe, 35.

1636
01:33:22,431 --> 01:33:24,564
<i>What are they wearing?</i>

1637
01:33:24,566 --> 01:33:26,900
The big man is wearing light
pants and a striped sweater,

1638
01:33:26,902 --> 01:33:29,302
and the man with scratches is
wearing brown pants and a vest.

1639
01:33:29,304 --> 01:33:31,771
He looks like he has a gun.

1640
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:34,541
<i>You said the suspect is armed?</i>

1641
01:33:34,543 --> 01:33:36,242
I believe so, yes. I'm
sorry, I have to go.

1642
01:33:36,244 --> 01:33:37,611
Otherwise, they might see me.

1643
01:33:50,325 --> 01:33:52,258
<i>All west units, possible 187.</i>

1644
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,728
<i>Suspects there now. Western and Third.</i>

1645
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:56,229
<i>Western and Third at Chinatown Express.</i>

1646
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:57,931
<i>Suspects are two male Hispanics.</i>

1647
01:33:57,933 --> 01:33:59,750
<i>Number one, large build.</i>

1648
01:33:59,751 --> 01:34:01,568
<i>Number two with scratches on
his face, inside the location.</i>

1649
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:06,606
<i>Possibly armed. Code Three,
incident 357 and 9753.</i>

1650
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:09,075
There's fucking people in there.

1651
01:34:09,077 --> 01:34:12,112
I count six.

1652
01:34:12,114 --> 01:34:14,347
So, they could start shooting.

1653
01:34:15,117 --> 01:34:16,282
They could.

1654
01:34:16,284 --> 01:34:17,817
So you said we were waiting for

1655
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:19,185
a better neighborhood with more people,

1656
01:34:19,187 --> 01:34:20,487
not a fucking restaurant.

1657
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,139
We work with what we're given.

1658
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:23,790
<i>Unit 14, responding to that Code Three.</i>

1659
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:25,158
You're going to go down the street,

1660
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,826
get an angle inside from over there.

1661
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:29,963
Steady hands. Use the zoom.

1662
01:34:29,965 --> 01:34:31,364
No fast pans.

1663
01:34:31,366 --> 01:34:32,966
I'll be filming from here.

1664
01:34:32,968 --> 01:34:35,268
Fuck that. I'm not
getting out of the car!

1665
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:39,839
I need a second angle
from down the street.

1666
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,307
We'll cut it together.

1667
01:34:41,309 --> 01:34:42,776
Two angles.

1668
01:34:42,778 --> 01:34:45,345
Believe me, it's more
dangerous here in the car.

1669
01:34:45,347 --> 01:34:47,313
I don't believe anything you say.

1670
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:49,949
Man, this is fucked!

1671
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:52,552
Do you know I've never once
sworn in front of an employer?

1672
01:34:52,554 --> 01:34:55,655
I am not doing it! I'm
not getting out of the car.

1673
01:34:55,657 --> 01:34:57,390
You're making a mistake.

1674
01:34:57,392 --> 01:35:00,260
I don't care about
the fucking job title.

1675
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:08,234
What if my problem wasn't
that I don't understand people,

1676
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:09,903
but that I don't like them?

1677
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:16,276
What if I was obliged to hurt
you for something like this?

1678
01:35:17,846 --> 01:35:19,312
I mean, physically.

1679
01:35:21,183 --> 01:35:23,550
I think you'd have to believe
afterwards, if you could,

1680
01:35:23,552 --> 01:35:26,019
that agreeing to participate

1681
01:35:26,021 --> 01:35:29,856
and then backing out at the
critical moment was a mistake.

1682
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:31,291
Because that's what I'm telling you.

1683
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:40,100
As clearly as I can.

1684
01:37:00,015 --> 01:37:02,882
<i>7-A-14. We're Code Six to location.</i>

1685
01:37:06,655 --> 01:37:09,556
<i>7-A-21. Show us backing 7-A-14.</i>

1686
01:38:06,414 --> 01:38:07,881
Oh, God.

1687
01:38:17,525 --> 01:38:19,792
<i>7-A-21. We're Code Six with 7-A-14.</i>

1688
01:38:39,047 --> 01:38:40,680
Oh, God.

1689
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:44,117
Oh, God.

1690
01:38:51,893 --> 01:38:53,159
Gun!

1691
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:57,196
Oh, God! Oh, fuck!

1692
01:38:57,198 --> 01:38:58,798
We have a gun! Two of them!

1693
01:39:00,702 --> 01:39:01,968
Call it in!

1694
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:03,202
<i>Shots fired. Shots fired.</i>

1695
01:39:03,204 --> 01:39:04,804
<i>Officer down. Officer needs help.</i>

1696
01:39:06,141 --> 01:39:07,607
One's down! In pursuit!

1697
01:39:09,144 --> 01:39:10,543
Go, go, go!

1698
01:39:11,646 --> 01:39:13,212
Oh, my God!

1699
01:39:20,722 --> 01:39:22,488
<i>Suspect leaving in a black Escalade</i>

1700
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:24,324
<i>and out of the location, heading north.</i>

1701
01:39:24,326 --> 01:39:25,625
Fuck!

1702
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,427
Did you get it?

1703
01:39:27,429 --> 01:39:29,929
There's people dead in there!

1704
01:39:29,931 --> 01:39:32,231
<i>7-A-27. I'm behind
vehicle, we are in pursuit.</i>

<i>All units at all frequencies, stand by.</i>

1707
01:39:37,772 --> 01:39:39,739
Aim the camera at the
car and start filming.

<i>7-A-27 in

<i>Suspect vehicle is a black Escalade.</i>

01:39:46,915 --> 01:39:48,648

1712
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:57,423
Oh!

01:39:57,425 --> 01:39:59,125
<i>7-A-27. We just turned
northbound on Western.</i>

1714

Stay on the police car.

1715
01:40:00,462 --> 01:40:02,595
You're right up his ass.

1716
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:04,330
Wide angle. We want all of this.

<i>...approaching a red light.</i>

01:41:08,863 --> 01:41:10,730
This guy's crazy. Fucking shit!

1745
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:12,165
<i>He's ramming my vehicle!</i>

1746
01:41:12,167 --> 01:41:13,366
<i>All units. Officer needs help.</i>

1747
01:41:13,368 --> 01:41:15,034
<i>Northbound Western.</i>

1748
01:41:15,036 --> 01:41:16,769
<i>Suspect now ramming a police vehicle.</i>

1749
01:41:16,771 --> 01:41:18,104
No matter what, keep shooting.

1750
01:41:18,106 --> 01:41:19,705
<i>Continuing northbound.</i>

1751
01:41:19,707 --> 01:41:20,773
Fuck!

1752
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:22,909
Oh, shit! Shit!

1753
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:25,678
Oh, my God!

1754
01:41:35,623 --> 01:41:37,256
<i>7-L-7,
come in.</i>

1755
01:41:40,295 --> 01:41:41,627
<i>7-L-7,
come in.</i>

1756
01:41:41,629 --> 01:41:43,129
Turn off the car.

1757
01:42:07,222 --> 01:42:08,488
He's dead.

1758
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:10,556
Get this shot.

1759
01:42:25,106 --> 01:42:26,339
Steady hands.

1760
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:33,079
Use your zoom.

1761
01:43:07,782 --> 01:43:09,782
Hold it right there! Put the gun down!

1762
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:26,866
He had a weapon. That was a just fire.

1763
01:43:26,868 --> 01:43:28,067
He's not moving.

1764
01:43:33,741 --> 01:43:34,807
Let's seal this off.

1765
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:40,880
You saw him.

1766
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:46,285
You saw him!

1767
01:43:48,656 --> 01:43:53,392
I can't jeopardize my company's success

1768
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:57,263
to retain an untrustworthy employee.

1769
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:00,733
You're crazy.

1770
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:04,604
You're crazy!

1771
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:08,541
You took my bargaining power, Rick.

1772
01:44:08,543 --> 01:44:10,776
You used it against me.

1773
01:44:10,778 --> 01:44:12,044
You would have done it again.

1774
01:44:12,046 --> 01:44:13,446
Just admit it.

1775
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:17,183
I don't know.

1776
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,686
I don't know.

1777
01:44:21,289 --> 01:44:22,622
I know.

1778
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,859
I know.

1779
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:37,770
Don't touch that unless it's
for prints. Make a clean sweep.

1780
01:44:40,808 --> 01:44:42,708
Go around the vehicle.

1781
01:44:47,081 --> 01:44:48,848
Let them through, here they come.

1782
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:10,069
Hello, Juliana.

1783
01:45:11,406 --> 01:45:13,005
Hello, Willy.

1784
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,646
Hello, Ben. Hello, Lisa.
- Hi!

1785
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:21,747
Hey. It's Lou, right?

1786
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:23,015
Yes, that's right!

1787
01:45:23,017 --> 01:45:24,317
Video News? That's right.

1788
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:25,651
You got something good for us tonight?

1789
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:27,920
I think so. I'm about
to show Nina right now.

1790
01:45:27,922 --> 01:45:30,256
I can tell by your tie, it's Friday.

1791
01:46:08,463 --> 01:46:10,229
You can leave.

1792
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:22,408
Wasn't that your partner?

1793
01:46:23,811 --> 01:46:25,911
As a matter of fact, that's him.

1794
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:29,982
Oh, I'm floored.

1795
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:33,152
I mean, it's amazing.

1796
01:46:33,988 --> 01:46:35,488
Thank you.

1797
01:46:36,357 --> 01:46:39,158
I mean, just amazing.

1798
01:46:41,262 --> 01:46:43,195
Thank you.

1799
01:46:43,197 --> 01:46:44,797
No, thank you.

1800
01:46:46,234 --> 01:46:48,100
Thank you for bringing it to me.

1801
01:46:49,404 --> 01:46:51,103
You're welcome.

1802
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,740
I want it, obviously.

1803
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:56,609
How much do you want it?

1804
01:46:58,546 --> 01:47:00,179
You tell me.

1805
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:04,583
Get this to graphics.

1806
01:47:04,585 --> 01:47:05,584
Who's in charge here?

1807
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:06,786
Who are you?

1808
01:47:06,788 --> 01:47:08,687
LAPD. Major case.

1809
01:47:08,689 --> 01:47:09,922
Pull the footage from these screens.

1810
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:11,257
Round it up. Let's go. All copies.

1811
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:13,125
Excuse me.

1812
01:47:13,127 --> 01:47:15,194
I'm the news director. Can I help you?

1813
01:47:15,196 --> 01:47:16,395
You can help yourself

1814
01:47:16,397 --> 01:47:18,130
by collecting up every
copy of the shootout

1815
01:47:18,132 --> 01:47:19,799
the chase, the crash, all of it. Now.

1816
01:47:19,801 --> 01:47:21,567
It's KWLA property.

1817
01:47:21,569 --> 01:47:23,402
It's evidence. Of what?

1818
01:47:23,404 --> 01:47:25,738
I got a cop near death in the hospital,

1819
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:27,606
three dead, four wounded,

1820
01:47:27,608 --> 01:47:29,742
and a dozen major crimes
stretching a mile of Third.

1821
01:47:29,744 --> 01:47:31,043
This tape is evidence.

1822
01:47:31,045 --> 01:47:32,778
It's news footage bought and paid for

1823
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:34,213
from an independent contractor.

1824
01:47:34,215 --> 01:47:35,581
And how do you think he got it?

1825
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:37,216
If there's an issue, speak to him.

1826
01:47:37,218 --> 01:47:38,417
Don't get in the way of this.

1827
01:47:38,419 --> 01:47:39,885
Unless you have a judge's order,

1828
01:47:39,887 --> 01:47:41,053
we're going with it in four minutes.

1829
01:47:41,055 --> 01:47:42,621
Hey.

1830
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:44,123
Isn't that him?

1831
01:47:48,896 --> 01:47:50,396
Camera One, stay centered up.

1832
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,633
Camera Two, we'll do a
zoom out when we come out.

1833
01:47:56,437 --> 01:47:59,171
Joel has got a source on the
taskforce who says they found drugs

1834
01:47:59,173 --> 01:48:00,840
at the Granada Hills house.

1835
01:48:00,842 --> 01:48:04,343
Cocaine in wrapped packages hidden
in crawlspaces. Over 50 pounds.

1836
01:48:04,345 --> 01:48:07,246
He confirmed it with an
investigator at the scene.

1837
01:48:07,248 --> 01:48:09,849
It wasn't a home invasion.
It was a drug robbery.

1838
01:48:09,851 --> 01:48:11,350
Give it to the noon crew.

1839
01:48:12,687 --> 01:48:13,686
This is news.

1840
01:48:13,688 --> 01:48:15,488
It detracts from the story.

1841
01:48:15,490 --> 01:48:17,356
It is the story.

1842
01:48:17,358 --> 01:48:20,292
The story is urban crime
creeping into the suburbs.

1843
01:48:20,294 --> 01:48:22,528
That's the story.

1844
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:24,196
Jesus, you sound like Lou.

1845
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:25,764
Ten seconds to back.

1846
01:48:25,766 --> 01:48:29,335
I think Lou is inspiring all
of us to reach a little higher.

1847
01:48:29,337 --> 01:48:34,373
Five, four, three, two, one. Sting it.

1848
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,277
Mics. Dissolve.

1849
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:51,290
You understand that you've
been read your rights,

1850
01:48:51,292 --> 01:48:53,325
and you're here voluntarily?

1851
01:48:53,327 --> 01:48:55,027
That's right. Yes.

1852
01:48:56,163 --> 01:48:58,998
And this is being recorded and filmed?

1853
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,766
<i>Yes, from the camera up there.</i>

1854
01:49:01,469 --> 01:49:02,935
<i>Wide angle.</i>

1855
01:49:03,337 --> 01:49:04,370
Mmm-hmm.

1856
01:49:08,075 --> 01:49:09,808
Would you tell me how it is you were

1857
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:11,210
at the Chinatown Express tonight

1858
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:12,578
and called the 911?

1859
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,812
Of course.

1860
01:49:13,814 --> 01:49:15,614
It began earlier in the day.

1861
01:49:16,984 --> 01:49:18,984
I was watering my plant.

1862
01:49:20,187 --> 01:49:22,755
I looked out my window at my apartment.

1863
01:49:22,757 --> 01:49:26,025
The one you visited.

1864
01:49:26,027 --> 01:49:29,228
I saw a dark-colored vehicle with two
men inside parked across the street.

1865
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,329
I didn't think anything of it,

1866
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:31,297
otherwise I would have reported it then.

1867
01:49:32,934 --> 01:49:34,633
We began our night,

1868
01:49:38,172 --> 01:49:41,006
my employee and myself.

1869
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:44,009
And around approximately 12:38,

1870
01:49:44,011 --> 01:49:45,945
I looked in my rearview mirror

1871
01:49:45,947 --> 01:49:48,013
and I saw what looked like the same men

1872
01:49:48,015 --> 01:49:50,182
in the same vehicle following us.

1873
01:49:50,184 --> 01:49:51,684
I made an evasive maneuver.

1874
01:49:51,686 --> 01:49:54,687
I circled back and tailed
them to the restaurant.

1875
01:49:54,689 --> 01:49:56,355
At which point, I saw them go inside

1876
01:49:56,357 --> 01:49:59,124
and recognized them as the
same men from the home invasion.

1877
01:50:00,127 --> 01:50:02,227
You told me you didn't see the men.

1878
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:04,096
That you didn't get a good look at them.

1879
01:50:04,098 --> 01:50:07,066
Well, it all came back to
me when I saw them going in.

1880
01:50:07,068 --> 01:50:10,536
Their shapes and their movements.

1881
01:50:10,538 --> 01:50:13,072
And then I saw that one of the
men had a gun under his shirt,

1882
01:50:13,074 --> 01:50:16,241
so I immediately got
my phone and dialed 911.

1883
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:17,876
That's your story?

1884
01:50:17,878 --> 01:50:20,045
That's what happened. That's
why I'm sitting here with you.

1885
01:50:20,047 --> 01:50:22,481
I think that the men saw my footage

1886
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:25,985
and they tracked me down.

1887
01:50:25,987 --> 01:50:27,720
You want to know what I think?

1888
01:50:28,823 --> 01:50:31,323
Yes, please.

1889
01:50:31,325 --> 01:50:34,560
I think you withheld information.

1890
01:50:34,562 --> 01:50:37,496
I think you saw the two men in
the murder house in Granada Hills

1891
01:50:37,498 --> 01:50:41,734
and you saw the car and you sat on it

1892
01:50:41,736 --> 01:50:44,103
to get something you could film.

1893
01:50:44,105 --> 01:50:46,171
What do you think about that?

1894
01:50:47,908 --> 01:50:50,109
I think that would be

1895
01:50:50,111 --> 01:50:52,911
a very unprofessional thing
for me to do in my business.

1896
01:50:52,913 --> 01:50:55,180
It would be murder.

1897
01:50:55,182 --> 01:50:56,582
I can understand why
you're looking into it,

1898
01:50:56,584 --> 01:50:58,117
but I didn't do anything like that.

1899
01:50:58,119 --> 01:50:59,585
Nothing that could be considered wrong.

1900
01:50:59,587 --> 01:51:01,086
You don't fool me for a minute.

1901
01:51:01,088 --> 01:51:03,088
I'm glad.

1902
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:06,525
I think everything you said is a lie.

1903
01:51:06,527 --> 01:51:08,827
I wish my partner was here
to back up what happened.

1904
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:10,696
You left your dead partner.

1905
01:51:10,698 --> 01:51:11,964
No, the ambulances arrived.

1906
01:51:11,966 --> 01:51:13,532
They're trained professionals.

1907
01:51:13,534 --> 01:51:15,434
Yeah, and you seem real
broken up about that.

1908
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:17,503
No, um...

1909
01:51:17,505 --> 01:51:19,438
He died doing what he loved.

1910
01:51:20,975 --> 01:51:23,542
You filmed him dying.

1911
01:51:25,613 --> 01:51:27,680
<i>Yeah. That's what I do. It's my job.</i>

1912
01:51:27,682 --> 01:51:29,114
<i>I like to say that if you're seeing me,</i>

1913
01:51:29,116 --> 01:51:31,283
<i>you're having the
worst day of your life.</i>

1914
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:05,317
<i>Any Rampart unit,</i>

1915
01:52:05,319 --> 01:52:07,553
<i>ambulance to 11 Rampart
on Second Avenue.</i>

1916
01:52:07,555 --> 01:52:09,955
<i>Victim, female, white.
Unknown property taken.</i>

1917
01:52:29,009 --> 01:52:30,342
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1918
01:52:32,847 --> 01:52:35,681
Congratulations.

1919
01:52:35,683 --> 01:52:37,616
Your selection by Video Production News

1920
01:52:37,618 --> 01:52:39,284
is evidence of the hiring
committee's recognition

1921
01:52:39,286 --> 01:52:43,222
of your employment history
and unique personal qualities.

1922
01:52:43,224 --> 01:52:45,424
It is my hope that through
hard work and commitment,

1923
01:52:45,426 --> 01:52:47,392
you will move through the intern program

1924
01:52:47,394 --> 01:52:49,528
and continue to pursue your career goals

1925
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:53,398
as full-time employees
of Video Production News.

1926
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,434
I can tell you from experience

1927
01:52:55,436 --> 01:52:58,437
that the surest way up the
ladder is to listen carefully

1928
01:52:58,439 --> 01:53:00,973
and follow my orders.

1929
01:53:00,975 --> 01:53:05,043
You may be confused at times,
and other times, unsure.

1930
01:53:05,045 --> 01:53:09,047
But remember, I will never
ask you to do anything

1931
01:53:10,384 --> 01:53:12,718
that I wouldn't do myself.
