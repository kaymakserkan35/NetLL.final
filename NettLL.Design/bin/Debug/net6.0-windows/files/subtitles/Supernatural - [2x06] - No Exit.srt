1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,720
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off...

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,820
saving people,
hunting things.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,990
The family business.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,680
THEN

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,570
Anybody here?

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,550
Don't move.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,770
Sam? Dean?

8
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,910
Mom, you know these guys?

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,110
I think these are John Winchester's boys.

10
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,130
Hey, I'm Ellen.
That's my daughter, Jo.

11
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,500
You're not gonna hit me again, are you?

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,280
You called our dad,
said you could help.

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,030
Help with what?

14
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,410
The demon, of course.

15
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,850
How do you know about all this?

16
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,470
Hey, I just run a saloon.

17
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,830
Hunters have been known
to pass through now and again --

18
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,170
including your dad a long time ago.
John was like family once.

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,020
You think dad and Ellen ever had a thing?

20
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,150
No way.

21
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,080
Then why didn't he tell us about her?

22
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,190
How did your mom get into this stuff?

23
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,420
My dad. He was a hunter.
He passed away.

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,280
I could help

25
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,130
I'm sure you could,
but I think your mother might kill me.

26
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,060
You're afraid of my mother?

27
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,700
I think so.

28
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,230
NOW

29
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,950
PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA

30
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,940
I checked the fuses. They're fine.

31
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,690
It's the wiring!

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,550
Look, you promised this placewould
be ready when I moved in.

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,890
No! You come up now!

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,090
Please.

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,360
Thank you.

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,350
Gross.

37
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,080
What the hell?

Los Angeles, California.

42
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,590
What's in L.A.?

43
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,030
A young girl's been kidnapped
by an evil cult.

44
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,220
Yeah?

45
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,600
- The girl got a name?
- Katie holmes.

46
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,760
That's funny.

47
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,530
Of course, on the other hand,
catfight.

48
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,470
I am your mother!
I don't have to be reasonable!

49
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,180
You can't keep me here!

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,400
Don't you bet on that,
sweetie!

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,430
Are you gonna chain me up
in the basement?

52
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,710
You've had worse ideas
than that recently.

53
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,770
You don't want to stay?
Don't -- go back to school!

54
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,590
I didn't belong there!
I was a freak with a knife collection!

55
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,830
Getting yourself killed on some dusty back road --
that's where you belong?

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,190
- Guys,bad time.
- Yes,ma'am.

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,430
We rarely drink
before 10:00 anyway.

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,750
Wait.

59
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,100
I want to know what
they think about this.

60
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,120
I don't care
what they think!

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,580
Are you guys open?

62
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,100
- Yes!
- No!

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,710
We'll just check out
the arby's down the road.

64
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,820
Harvelle'S.

65
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,750
Yeah,preacher.

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,790
Three weeks ago,a young girl disappears
from a philadelphia apartment.

67
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,320
Take it.
It won't bite.

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,750
No,but your mom might.

69
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,600
And this girl wasn't the first.
Over the past 80 years,6 women have vanished --

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,140
all from the same building,
all young blondes.

71
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,730
It only happens every decade or two,
so cops never eyeball the pattern.

72
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,070
So we're either dealing with one
very old serial killer --

73
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,030
who put this together?
Ash?

74
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,710
I did it myself.

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,600
I got to admit,
we hit the road for a lot less.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,690
Good. If you like the case
so much,you take it.

77
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,050
Joanna beth,this family
has lost enough.

78
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,020
I won't lose you,too.

79
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,130
I just won'T.

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,820
Mother told me

81
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,020
yes,she told me

82
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,280
I'd meet girls like you

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,100
she also told me,

84
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,090
"stay away

85
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,610
you'll never know
what you'll catch"

86
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,480
Mommy's all right,

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,950
daddy's all right

88
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,430
they just seem
a little weird

89
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,010
surrender,surrender

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,800
I feel kind of bad,
snaking jo's case.

91
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,810
Well,maybe she put together
a good file,

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,020
but could you see her out here
working one of these things?

93
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,890
I don't think so.

94
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,130
You getting anything?

95
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,130
No,not yet.

96
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,870
What's that?

97
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,720
What?

98
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,850
Holy crap.

99
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,310
That's ectoplasm.

100
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,250
Well,sam,I think I know
what we're dealing with here.

101
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,020
It's the stay-puftmarshmallow man.

102
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,630
Dean,I've only seenthis stuff like twice.

103
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,270
I mean,to make this stuff,
you have to be one majorlypissed-off spirit.

104
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's find this badass
before he snags any more girls.

105
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,440
Yeah,it's a great building.
I fixed it up real nice.

106
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,830
All the apartmentscome furnished,too.

107
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,600
Yeah,I lovethe furnishings.
It's so spacious,

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,940
and the locationis so convenient for me.

109
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,590
What the hellare you doing here?

110
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,450
There you are,honey.

111
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,460
This is my boyfriend,dean,and his buddy sam.

112
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,230
Good to meet you.Quite a gal you got here.

113
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,140
Yeah,she's a pistol!

114
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,840
So,did you already check outthe apartment?

115
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,480
The one for rent.

116
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,770
Yeah. Yes. Loved it.
Great flow.

117
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,440
- How'd you get in?
- It was open.

118
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,190
Now,ed,when did the lasttenant move out?

119
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,390
Uh,about a month ago.
Cut and run,too.

120
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,400
Stiffed me for the rent.

121
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,170
Well,her loss,our gain,

122
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,510
'cause if deano loves it,
it's good enough for me.

123
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,460
Oh,sweetie.

124
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,810
We'll take it.

125
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,750
Okay.

126
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,540
I'll flip youfor the sofa.

127
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,900
Does your mother even knowyou're here?

128
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,110
I told herI was going to vegas.

129
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,200
You thinkshe's gonna buy that?

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,080
I'm not an idiot.

131
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,010
I got ash to laya credit-card trail
all the wayto the casinos.

132
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,410
You shouldn't lieto your mom.
You shouldn't be here,either.

133
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,460
Well,I am,so untwist
your boxers and deal with it.

134
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,400
Where'd you get allthat money from,anyways?

135
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Working at the roadhouse.

136
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,640
Hunters don't tip that well.

137
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
They aren't that goodat poker,either.

138
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,920
- Yeah?
- Is she with you?

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,110
Oh,hi,ellen.

140
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,750
She left a noteshe's in vegas.
I don't believe itfor a second.

141
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,890
-*************
-*************

142
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,740
-*************
-*************

143
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,340
- Dean?
- I haven't seen her.

144
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,600
- You sure about that?
- Yeah,I'm sure.

145
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,730
Well,please,if she shows up,
you'll drag her butt back here,won't you?

146
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,840
- Absolutely.
- Okay. Thanks,hon.

147
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,820
This place was builtin 1924.

148
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,180
It was originallya warehouse,
converted into apartmentsa few months ago.

149
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,510
Yeah?What was here before 1924?

150
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,890
Nothing.An empty field.

151
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,770
So the most likelyscenario --

152
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,040
someone died bloodyin the building,
and now he's backand raising hell.

153
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,050
I already checked.

154
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,750
In the past 82 years,zero violent deaths,

155
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,080
unless you count a janitorwho slipped
on a wet floor.

156
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,910
Would you sit down,please?

157
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,790
So,have you checkedthe police reports,
county death records?

158
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,290
Obituaries,mortuary reports,
and seven other sources.

159
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,360
I know what I'm doing.

160
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,540
I think the jury's still outon that one.

161
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,070
Would you putthe knife down?

162
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,710
Okay.
So,uh,it'ssomething else,then.

163
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,350
Maybe some kindof cursed object
that brought a spiritwith it.

164
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,180
We got to scanthe whole building.
Right.So,you and me --

165
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,860
we'll take the toptwo floors.

166
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,080
We'd move fasterif we split up.

167
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,980
Oh,this isn't negotiable.

168
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,980
So,are you gonnabuy me dinner?

169
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,230
What are youtalking about?

170
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,030
It's just if you're gonnaride me this close,
it's only decentyou buy me dinner.

171
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,980
Oh,that's hilarious.

172
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,520
It's bad enoughI lied to your mom,

173
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,480
but if you think I'm lettingyou out of my sight --

174
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,960
I don't knowif you noticed,
but you're kindof the spirit's type.

175
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,680
Exactly.

176
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,900
You want to be bait?

177
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,740
The quickest way to draw it out,and you know it.

178
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,890
- What?
- I'm so regretting this.

179
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,010
I've had it up to herewith your crap.

180
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,700
Excuse me?

181
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,400
Your chauvinist crap.

182
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,070
You think womencan't do the job.

183
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,620
Sweetheart,this ain't gender studies.
Women can do the job fine.

184
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,000
Amateurs can'T.You got no experience.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,620
What you do have is a bunchof
half-baked romantic notions
that some barfly has putin your head.

186
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,260
And now you sound likemy mother.

187
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,470
Oh,and that's a bad thing
?Because let me tell you --

188
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,410
what?

189
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,340
Forget it.

190
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,790
No,you started this.

191
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,510
Jo,you got options.
No one in their right mindchooses this life.

192
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,880
My dad started me in thiswhen I was so young.
I wish I could dosomething else.

193
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,110
You love the job.

194
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,550
Yeah,butI'm a little twisted.

195
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,190
You don't thinkI'm a little twisted,too?

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,130
Jo,you got a motherthat worries about you,

197
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,460
who wants somethingmore for you.
Those are good things.

198
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,840
You don't throw thingslike that away.

199
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,560
They might be hardto find later.

200
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,290
What?

201
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,750
I'm not sure.

202
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,910
Do you smell that?

203
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,360
What is it,a gas leak?

204
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,720
No.It's something else.

205
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,190
I know it.
I just can't put my fingeron it.

206
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,520
Mazel tov.
You just foundyour first spirit.

207
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,760
It's inside the vent.

208
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,970
Here.

209
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,460
There's somethingin there. Here.

210
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,440
Someone's keepingsouvenirs.

211
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,830
This building -- I swear to god.

212
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,910
I'm so out of here.

213
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,980
Morning,princess.

214
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,040
- Where's sam?
- Went to get coffee.

215
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,730
My back.

216
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,110
How'd you sleepon that big,soft bed?

217
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,760
I didn'T.

218
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,300
I've just been going overeverything.

219
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,830
Here.

220
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,160
What's this for?

221
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,570
It'll work a hellof a lot better than that little
pigstick you've been twirling around.

222
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,230
W A H

223
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,460
William anthony harvelle.

224
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,280
I'm sorry.My mistake.

225
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,160
What do you --

226
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,150
what do you rememberabout your dad?

227
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,850
What's the first thingthat pops into your head?

228
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,660
Come on. Tell me.

229
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,070
I was 6 or 7...

230
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,320
and,uh...

231
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,290
he took me shootingfor the first time.

232
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,340
Bottles on a fence --that kind of thing.

233
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,790
I bull's-eyedevery one of them.

234
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,030
And he would smile,like...

235
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,740
*****************

236
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,960
he must have been proud.

237
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,890
What about your dad?

238
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,760
I was still in pigtailswhen my dad died,but...

239
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,640
I remember him coming homefrom a hunt.

240
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,510
He'd burstthrough that door like --

241
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,230
like steve mcqueenor something.

242
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,410
And he'd sweep me upin his arms,

243
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,350
and I'd breathe in that oldleather jacket of his.

244
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,000
And my mom --who was sour and pissed

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,050
from the minute he left -
she started smiling again.

246
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,950
And we were...

247
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,090
we were a family.

248
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,090
You want to know whyI want to do the job?

249
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,120
For him.

250
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,210
It's my way of being closeto him.

251
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,490
Now,tell me,what's wrong with that?

252
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,860
Nothing.

253
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,590
- Where's the coffee?
- There are cops outside.

254
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,690
Another girl disappeared.

255
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,300
Theresa ellis --apartment 2-F.

256
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,530
Her boyfriend reported hermissing around dawn.

257
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,070
And her apartment?

258
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,000
Cracks all over the plaster --walls,ceiling.

259
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,510
There's ectoplasm,too.

260
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,710
Between thatand that tuft of hair,
I'd say the sucker'scoming from the walls.

261
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,970
But who is it?
The building's history'stotally clean.

262
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,590
Maybe we're lookingin the wrong place.

263
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,170
- What do you mean?
- Check this out.

264
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,980
An empty field?

265
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,770
It's where this buildingwas built.
Take a look at the onenext door.

266
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,550
The windows.

267
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,520
Bars.

268
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,430
We're next doorto a prison?

269
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,680
Thanks,ash.

270
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,710
Oh,and if you breathe a wordof this to my mom --

271
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,760
that's right. I will.With pliers.

272
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,750
Okay.
Moyamensing prison --

273
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,530
built in 1835,torn down in 1963.
And get this --

274
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,380
they used to execute peopleby hanging them
in the empty field next door.

275
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,890
Well,then,we need a list
of all the peopleexecuted there.

276
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,860
Ash is already on it.

277
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,930
157 names?

278
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,410
- We got to narrow that down.
- Yeah.

279
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,090
Or else we're gonna be diggingup a hell
of a lot of stiffs.

280
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,200
Herman webster mudgett?

281
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,580
Yeah?

282
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,560
Wasn't that H.H. Holmes'real name?

283
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,480
You got to be kidding me.

284
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,860
MULTI-MURDERER MEET HIS  M******

285
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,240
Holmes was executedat moyamensing may 7,1896.

286
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,490
H.H. Holmes himself.

287
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,640
Come on.I mean,what are the odds?

288
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,470
Who is this guy?

289
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,800
The term "multi-murderer" --
they coined itto describe holmes.

290
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,100
He was america's firstserial killer
before anybody knewwhat a serial killer was.

291
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,620
He confessed to 27 murders,
but some put the death tollat over 100.

292
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,220
And his victim flavorof choice --
pretty,petite blondes.

293
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,620
He,uh,used chloroformto kill them,

294
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,920
which is what I smelledin the hallway last night.

295
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,780
At his place,cops found human remains,

296
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,400
bone fragments,and long locksof bloody blond hair.

297
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,520
Boy,he sure knewhow to pick them.

298
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,190
We just find the bones,
salt them,and burn them,right?

299
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,520
It's not that easy.

300
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,800
His body is buried in town,

301
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,500
but it's encased in a coupletons of concrete.

302
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,210
What? Why?

303
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,490
The story goesthat he didn't want
anybody mutilatinghis corpse

304
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,210
'cause,you know,it's what he used to do.

305
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,120
You know something?

306
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,100
We might have an even biggerproblem than that.

307
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,080
How does this get bigger?

308
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,040
Holmes built an apartmentbuilding in chicago.

309
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,340
They called itthe murder castle.
The whole placewas a death factory.

310
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,500
They had trapdoors,acid vats,quicklime pits.

311
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,110
He built thesesecret chambers...

312
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,020
inside the walls.

313
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,230
He'd lock his victims in,keep them alive for days.

314
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,030
Some,he'd suffocate.

315
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,160
Others,he'd letstarve to death.

316
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,200
So theresa couldstill be alive.
She could beinside these walls.

317
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,660
We need sledgehammers,crowbars.
We got to smash these walls

318
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,920
anywhere thick enoughto hide a girl.

319
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,000
Okay.
Call us after you checkthe southeast wall.

320
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,930
Sam's almost donewith the first floor.

321
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,630
He hasn't foundjack squat,either.

322
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,650
What is it?

323
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,200
It's too narrow.We can't go any further.

324
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,900
- Let me see.
- What are you --

325
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,310
- I should have cleanedthe pipes.
- What?

326
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,760
I wish the pipeswere clean.

327
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,730
Shut up!

328
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,250
I can fit in there.

329
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,000
You're not going in thereby yourself.

330
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,610
You got a better idea?

331
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,040
The --

332
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,500
- Where are you?
- By the north wall.

333
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm heading downsome kind of air duct.

334
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,270
No,no,no,no.Stay up here.

335
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,400
We got to find this girl,don't we?

336
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,470
I'm okay.

337
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,410
All right.I'm heading to you.

338
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,210
Oh,god.

339
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,410
What is it?

340
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,790
Jo? Jo?!

341
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,420
Jo!

342
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,140
Jo?!

343
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,260
Jo!

344
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,620
- He's got jo.
- What?How'd that happen?

345
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,690
I wasn't with her.I left her alone.
Damn it!

346
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,490
Look,we'll find her.Where?
Inside the walls.We were inside the walls.

347
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,830
None of the other girlsare there.
She won't be,either.

348
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,650
Look,take a beatand think about this.
Maybe we got holmes'M.O. Wrong.

349
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,670
Well,we better friggin'think fast.

350
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,100
Yeah?

351
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,070
You lied to me.She's there.

352
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,380
- Ellen.
- Ash told me everything.

353
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,400
The man's a genius,but he folds like a cheap suit.

354
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,880
You put my damn daughteron the phone.

355
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,300
She's gonna haveto call you back.
She's,uh,taking careof feminine business.

356
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,520
Yeah,right.Where is she?

357
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,980
Where is she?!

358
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,580
Look,we'll get her back.

359
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,020
Get her back?Back from what?

360
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,690
The spirit we're hunting --it took her.

361
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,410
Oh,my god.

362
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,930
She'll be okay.
I promise.You promise?

363
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,800
*******************That is not the first time
I'veheard that from a winchester.

364
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,920
What?

365
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,840
If anything happens to her --

366
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,370
it won'T.I won't let it.

367
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,180
Ellen,I'm sorry.I really am.

368
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,870
I'm taking the firstflight out.
I'll be there in a few hours.

369
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,620
Damn it!

370
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,680
Don't beat yourself up,dean.
There's nothingyou could have done.

371
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,190
Tell me you got something.

372
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,460
Uh,maybe.

373
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,180
Look.

374
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,950
If you look at the layout
of the holmes murder castle,

375
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,220
there's other torture chambersinside
the walls,right?

376
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,630
But there's one we haven'tconsidered yet --

377
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,990
the one in his basement.

378
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,050
This building doesn't havea basement.

379
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,710
You're right.It doesn'T.
But I just noticed this.

380
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,320
Beneath the foundation,

381
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,530
it looks like partof an old sewer system.
It hasn't been used for --

382
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,980
let's go.

383
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,910
Hello?

384
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,900
Is -- is anybody there?

385
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,910
Your name's theresa?

386
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,000
Yes.

387
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,850
This won't make youfeel better,but...

388
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,630
I'm here to rescue you.

389
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,420
Oh,god.He's out there.
He's gonna kill us!

390
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,490
No,he won't!

391
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,760
We're getting out.

392
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,470
My friendsare looking for us.

393
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,220
Oh,god,it's him!

394
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,530
Shh! Just be quiet!

395
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,760
Here.

396
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,490
Got it?Yeah.

397
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,190
You're so pretty.

398
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,220
So beautiful.

399
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,240
Go to hell!

400
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,800
How do you like that?!

401
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,790
Pure iron,you creepy-assson of a bitch!

402
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,100
Is he gone?

403
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,170
I don't know.
I --

404
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,670
Hey!

405
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,070
No!

406
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,870
Jo!

407
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,040
I'm here!

408
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,380
Hey. I'm gonna get you out
of here,all right?

409
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,560
Sam!

410
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,570
Hang on.

411
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,050
- You all right?
- I've been better.

412
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,200
Let's get the hell out of here
before he comes back.

413
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,240
Actually,I don't think
you're leaving here just yet.

414
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,920
What?

415
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,500
Remember when I saidyou
being bait was a bad plan?

416
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,650
Now it's kind ofthe only one we got.

417
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,920
Now!

418
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,450
Scream all you want!
There's no way you're steppingover that salt!

419
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,660
So...

420
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,370
is this job as glamorous
as you thought it would be?

421
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,780
Well,except for all thepee-
your-pants terror,yeah.

422
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,200
But that theresa girl'sgonna
live a life 'cause of us.

423
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,860
It's worth it,isn't it?

424
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,290
Yeah.

425
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,740
Yeah,it is.

426
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,680
Hey,what if somebodyfinds
that sewer done there

427
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,580
or a stormwashes the salt away?

428
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,900
Both very fine points,
which is why we're waiting here.

429
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,410
For what?

430
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,470
FOR THIAT

431
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,650
You ripped offa cement truck?

432
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,160
I'll give it back.

433
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,740
Well,that ought tokeep him down there
till hell freezes over.

434
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,840
well,you --
you really weren't kidding
about flying out,were you?

435
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,240
How about we listento some music?

436
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,030
You're as cold as ice

437
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,850
This is gonna bea long drive.

438
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,300
Ellen...

439
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,160
it was my fault.Okay?
I lied to you,and I'm sorry.

440
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,420
But jo did good out there.
I think her dad would be proud.

441
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,100
Don't you dare say that --not you.

442
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,730
I need a momentwith my daughter --
alone.

443
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,320
You're angry.I understand.

444
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,210
Angry doesn't beginto touch it!

445
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,860
Let's just think about this.
Everything's okay.

446
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,350
I'm alive.

447
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,890
Not afterI'm through with you!

448
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,320
Is this about me huntingor something else?

449
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,940
You let those boysuse you as bait.

450
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,710
They were backing me upthe whole time.

451
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,620
That is why you do not have
the sense to do this job.

452
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,360
- You're trusting your lifeto them.
- What are you talking about?

453
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,720
Like father,like son.
That is whatI'm talking...

454
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,770
john?

455
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,500
I thought you and johnwere friends.

456
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,620
Yeah,we were. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean --

457
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,030
mom...

458
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,300
what aren't youtelling me?

459
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,370
- That bad,huh?
- Not right now.

460
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,640
What happened?Hey,talk to me.

461
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,310
Get off me!

462
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,690
Sorry.I'll see you around.

463
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,900
Dean...

464
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,830
it turns out my dad hada partner
on his last hunt.

465
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,110
Funny,he usually worked alone.
This guy did,too.

466
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,110
But I guess my father figuredhe
could trust him.

467
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,560
A mistake.
The guy screwed up,got my dad killed.

468
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,920
- What does this have --
- it was your father,dean.

469
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,480
What?

470
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,090
Why do you thinkjohn never came back,
never told you about us?

471
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,990
'Cause he couldn't look
my momin the eye after that --
that's why.

472
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,130
- Jo --
- just --

473
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,360
just get out of here.

474
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,040
Please,just leave.
