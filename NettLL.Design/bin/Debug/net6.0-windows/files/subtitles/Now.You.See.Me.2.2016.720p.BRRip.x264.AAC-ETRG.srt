to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

it won't be a snipe hunt.

to trip the other.

that it's funny "ha ha."

I guess it's all

Well, Lula's been on
the underground scene
for the last decade,

296
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,550
and I think she
has some real talent,

try her on stage

get back on stage again.

just showed up.

I've been behind

is we've been in this...

is that we have been

know what it is.

you say that.

you're referring to
is us, not you.

Listen, I'm getting
my orders directly
from the Eye.

315

Okay? And then
I give them to you.

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,717
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

317

But I'm... Mmm.

just weigh in here
really quickly?

in the neck one time.

a little bit like
my family unit.

Literally?
But, yeah.

00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,383
It was an accident,
I think.

327
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:26,508
Okay. So, does this mean
we're actually going
to do something?

328
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,633
Yes.

died about a year ago.

been leading to?

of the next-gen cell phone.

333
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:42,675
Once these phones
hit the streets,

334
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,592
they'll siphon
their users' information
to the black market.

335
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:49,383
Meaning Octa's
selling privacy
to up their profit.

336
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,383

to expose them for it.

is to hijack the show.

been waiting for.

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,675
Then what about girls?

1010
00:46:57,675 --> 00:46:59,550
Like, relationships?
(GROANS)

1011
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,758
What?

1012
00:47:04,592 --> 00:47:08,300
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

1013
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,883
but every girl
I get close to,

1014
00:47:11,883 --> 00:47:14,383
I end up
taking their trust.

1015
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:16,883
And then their wallet.

1016
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,633
So...

1017
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,550
You take their wallets?

1018
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,633
Yeah.

1019
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:27,925
You ever take
their belts?

1020
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:30,592
Or how about

1021
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:33,842
some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

1022
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:36,842
Not sure why
you took those.

1023
00:47:36,842 --> 00:47:40,008
I'm sorry, did you think
that I was like
those other girls?

1024
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,467
Oh, Jack.

1025
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,383
ATLAS: Okay. So there's
a marketplace
down the street.

1026
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:53,550
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

1027
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,383
He'll get the stick
to the right people
and get us home.

1028
00:47:56,383 --> 00:47:58,425
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

1029
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,300
And, hey,
put your belt on.

1030
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,008
(STAMMERS)
Oh, no, it's not...
She took it off me and...

1031
00:48:04,008 --> 00:48:06,967
MERRITT: You know,
the most heartbreaking
moment of my life

1032
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,300
was when I discovered

1033
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,800
that you had stolen
all my money and split.

1034
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,967
I didn't realize until now

1035
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:16,550
how much of that money
you put into your face.

1036
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:21,300
Seriously, is it weird
to have more hair in your
nose than on your head?

1037
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,842
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

1038
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:26,633
you might wanna
consider requesting

1039
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:29,550
something other
than old man pubes.

1040
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:33,675
You know what?
You are such a buffoon,
Mer-Bear.

1041
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:35,675
And this little ploy
you have

1042
00:48:35,675 --> 00:48:39,842
of stalling me
while your friends
screw over my employer?

1043
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:41,550
Not gonna work.

1044
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,717
(GIGGLES)

1045
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,675
Chase!
As you stare
into my eyes,

1046
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:48,050
you will find
that you wanna sleep.

1047
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,592
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

1048
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:54,050
and realize that
you will never be
half the man that he is.

1049
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,342
(SLAPS)

1050
00:48:56,008 --> 00:48:57,300
Merritt,

1051
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,717
I am so, so
very, very sorry

1052
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:05,550
about how pathetic
your pupil is.

1053
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,800
Hey, a little hint
on your technique
of surprise.

1054
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,592
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

1055
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:15,925
Hey, this has been fun,
Mer-Bear.

1056
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:18,008
Let's do it again
sometime.

1057
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:22,967
THADDEUS: Well,

1058
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:26,508
I've had ample time to do
some research, and you know,

1059
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,342
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

1060
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:32,800
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

1061
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,842
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

1062
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:38,383
that this road would lead
to the great wizard
behind the curtain

1063
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:40,883
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

1064
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:43,842
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

1065
00:49:43,842 --> 00:49:45,342
Listen to me.
I broke you out of there.

1066
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:46,592
We're not
changing the terms now.

1067
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:47,842
You put me there!
Yeah,

1068
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:49,425
because you deserve
to be there.

1069
00:49:49,425 --> 00:49:52,050
Listen, I did not
kill your father.

1070
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,967
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

1071
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,425
I know who you are,

1072
00:49:58,425 --> 00:49:59,675
Shrike.

1073
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:02,967
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

1074
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:07,008
I know you think
I goaded him into performing
a trick he couldn't pull off.

1075
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:09,425
I know the time in
jail was a result

1076
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:11,592
of a 30-year revenge plot
against me.

1077
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,300
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

1078
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,508
Man.

1079
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,425
30 years.

1080
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:24,592
and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

1081
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:26,967
Just to put me
behind bars.

1082
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,342
Okay.

1083
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:31,883
So how did it feel,
seeing me there?

1084
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:34,675
Was it all you hoped?

1085
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:35,883
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1086
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:37,050
You're lying.

1087
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,425
It was an empty experience.

1088
00:50:40,425 --> 00:50:42,508
And you wanna know
how I know?

1089
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,425
I know because you know.

1090
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:50,842
There's always, always more

1091
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:52,675
than what's on the surface.
So what,

1092
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,300
the past didn't happen,
and you're not
who I think you are?

1093
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,883
Now, don't tell me
in 30 years

1094
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:58,758
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

1095
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:00,925
I am not my father.

1096
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,758
You're not getting
in my head, okay?

1097
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:05,425
You think you're
luring me into a trap?
You're not.

1098
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:08,008
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

1099
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:11,633
My only concern is
the health and well-being
of the Horsemen.

1100
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:14,425
And you're gonna
lead me to them.
And if you don't,

1101
00:51:14,425 --> 00:51:16,425
I promise you,
you're gonna end up
far worse

1102
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:19,008
than in some cushy
jail cell somewhere.

1103
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,050
THADDEUS: What if the Horsemen
don't actually
need you to save them?

1104
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:43,342
ATLAS: All right.
So the lab is made up
of two distinct layers,

1105
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:44,633
the security perimeter

1106
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:46,633
and the clean room.

1107
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,675
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

1108
00:51:48,717 --> 00:51:50,717
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

1109
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:52,633
and replace it with a decoy.

1110
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:58,592
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size
to a playing card,

1111
00:51:58,592 --> 00:52:00,550
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

1112
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,675
Whoa, whoa!

1113
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,342
That's no good.

1114
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:20,967
ATLAS: So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

1115
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:22,842
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

1116
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:24,800
<i>He's RSVP'd with</i>
<i>what looks like</i>

1117
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,675
<i>a couple of members</i>
<i>of his security detail.</i>

1118
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:29,717
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,</i>
<i>and somebody named Buffy.</i>

1119
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:33,508
LULA:  <i>Yeah, apparently,</i>
<i>he travels with a different</i>
<i>bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>

1120
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:35,550
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

1121
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,675
Hey, can I get in?

1122
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:49,925
At the soothing
sound of the slots

1123
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:53,508
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

1124
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:59,300
<i>they will think you're Hannes,</i>
<i>so lead them out</i>
<i>and keep them busy.</i>

1125
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,508
You trust your
people implicitly.

1126
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:03,550
You will have them
take care of everything,

1127
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,967
and you will wait
in the car.

1128
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:08,675
And eyes open,
wide awake. Go.
(SNAPS FINGERS)

1129

JACK: Excuse me.
These people
are following me.

1130
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:11,842
You might wanna
check their pockets.

1131
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:13,467
(ARGUING IN CANTONESE)

1132
00:53:15,842 --> 00:53:17,633
ATLAS:  <i>Then our time is</i>
<i>ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

1133
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:19,008
<i>and get the card</i>
<i>to the market,</i>

1134
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:20,508

<i>so we can all</i>
<i>get the hell home.</i>

1136
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,717
Ah! Hannes, my old friend.

1137
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,425
So glad
you could make it.

1138
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:47,550
I knew you had
a soft spot for
an old-school bidding war.

1139
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,675
How have you been?

1140
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:50,842
I trust my people
implicitly.

1141
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:55,592
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see
it for yourself.

1142
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:58,425
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

1143
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:03,425
Or not. Also fine.

1144
00:54:03,425 --> 00:54:05,508
Well, if you'd like
to follow me.

1145
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:11,508
You'll have to
remove all your metal.

1146
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:12,717
Watches, rings, etc.

1147
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:13,967
Yeah, of course.

1148
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:15,842
Excuse me for asking...

1149
00:54:15,842 --> 00:54:17,758
Where might I
have seen you before?

1150
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,508
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

1151
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,675
The book jacket!

1152
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,342
I have to say,
Dr. Michaelakis,

1153
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:25,592
I'm a huge fan.

1154
00:54:25,592 --> 00:54:27,550
(CHUCKLING) Oh,
thank you so much.

1155
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,008
Uh, which book?
There have been so many.

1156
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,883
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

1157
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:36,758
Doctor?

1158
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:43,342
Sorry, when you say "chippy,"
you are referring
to Buffy here, yeah?

1159
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:44,508
Of course.

1160
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:48,550
Hannes prefers
the term "floozy"

1161
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,842
for all his boy toys.

1162
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:53,883
Yeah. He does.
That's good.
Noted.

1163
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:56,008
By the way,
I got your email,
Dr. Michaelakis.

1164
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:57,633
You had a query
about our ability

1165
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,758
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1166
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,675
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators,

1167
00:55:01,717 --> 00:55:04,425
or error correction.

1168
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:06,008
Do you care
to elucidate?

1169
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,550
Right.
Yeah.

1170
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,550
Yes, I did send that email.

1171
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,342
The other day, I saw you.
I did, I sent it.

1172
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:12,592
So what gives?

1173
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:14,008

2189
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,717
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

2190
01:53:04,717 --> 01:53:07,550
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

2191
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:09,842
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

2192
01:53:11,717 --> 01:53:12,967
10 minutes.

2193
01:53:15,467 --> 01:53:17,592
DYLAN: Now you're playing
the long game.

(HELICOPTER HOVERING)

2195
01:53:31,425 --> 01:53:33,675
Dad, I promise
you I will fix this.

2196
01:53:33,675 --> 01:53:36,008
You can't.
Stop calling me dad.

2197
01:53:36,008 --> 01:53:40,050
There were so many women,
I have no idea
whose bastard you are.

2198
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:43,717
What happened?
Thin air, gone.
Come with me.

2199
01:53:43,717 --> 01:53:45,550
What're you talking
about, gone?

2200
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:47,508
People don't
just disappear.

2201
01:53:47,508 --> 01:53:50,342
You realize that
he doesn't actually
have magical powers!

2202
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,383
Hey, guys.
Hey!

2203
01:54:31,383 --> 01:54:33,758
Good to see you all.
Good to see you, Li.

2204
01:54:34,842 --> 01:54:36,008
Come on in.

2205
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:40,633
BU BU: Good morning.

2206
01:54:40,967 --> 01:54:42,050
Welcome.

2207
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:46,467
I'm proud of you.

2208
01:54:46,467 --> 01:54:48,008
All of you.

2209
01:54:48,008 --> 01:54:50,508
I have a lot to show you.

2210
01:54:50,508 --> 01:54:51,717
Come.

2211
01:54:52,842 --> 01:54:54,050
Come.

2212
01:55:05,508 --> 01:55:06,717
Dad.

2213
01:55:24,008 --> 01:55:25,758
THADDEUS: Yes.

2214
01:55:25,758 --> 01:55:28,633
Your father and I
were partners.

2215
01:55:28,633 --> 01:55:31,800
Our act was
that of rivals.

2216
01:55:32,883 --> 01:55:35,842
I was the
hard-eyed realist.

2217
01:55:35,842 --> 01:55:38,675
He was the
dreamy-eyed idealist.

2218
01:55:38,675 --> 01:55:41,508
We thought it was
the perfect misdirect.

2219
01:55:42,508 --> 01:55:46,342
Yes, in public,
I did goad him.

2220
01:55:46,342 --> 01:55:48,300
The only thing
we didn't count on

2221
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:50,925
was it going so wrong.

2222
01:55:54,967 --> 01:55:56,842
Why?

2223
01:55:56,842 --> 01:55:58,758
Why didn't you ever
say anything to me?

2224
01:55:58,758 --> 01:56:00,425
I don't know.

2225
01:56:01,467 --> 01:56:02,800
Give it a name.

2226
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,842
Shame, guilt.

2227
01:56:04,842 --> 01:56:06,342
Regret.

2228
01:56:09,925 --> 01:56:12,925
ATLAS: Hey, guys, uh,
you might wanna come
take a look at this.

2229
01:56:14,633 --> 01:56:15,717
Hmm.

2230
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:18,508
Look.

2231
01:56:18,508 --> 01:56:20,342
DYLAN:  <i>I put you</i>
<i>in jail, man.</i>

2232
01:56:20,342 --> 01:56:22,717
Why didn't you
say something then?

2233
01:56:22,717 --> 01:56:25,842
Well, you know,
I was going to.

2234
01:56:25,842 --> 01:56:29,842
But then, you were
so quick to show your
personal motivations that...

2235
01:56:31,717 --> 01:56:33,508
Well, quite frankly

2236
01:56:33,508 --> 01:56:35,300
it spoiled
the trick for me.

2237
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:36,633
I showed my weakness.

2238
01:56:36,633 --> 01:56:39,508
Well, it showed
you weren't ready.

2239
01:56:39,508 --> 01:56:42,300
But when you came
back to my cell,

2240
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:46,342
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me

2241
01:56:47,592 --> 01:56:48,967
for your Horsemen.

2242
01:56:50,633 --> 01:56:53,342
<i>And I said to myself,</i>

2243
01:56:53,342 --> 01:56:55,425
<i>"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

2244
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:58,675
<i>And I knew it was my job</i>

2245
01:56:58,675 --> 01:57:03,508
<i>to see to it that</i>
<i>he became the magician</i>
<i>he was born to be.</i>

2246
01:57:03,508 --> 01:57:05,842
All that was
left then was...

2247
01:57:07,633 --> 01:57:08,883
For me to hit bottom.

2248
01:57:09,675 --> 01:57:10,967
So the safe,

2249
01:57:10,967 --> 01:57:12,925
my father's wristwatch,

2250
01:57:12,925 --> 01:57:14,592
that was all you?

2251
01:57:17,342 --> 01:57:20,675
<i>Walter and Tressler,</i>
<i>were they in on it too?</i>

2252
01:57:20,675 --> 01:57:23,633
THADDEUS:  <i>Oh, we knew</i>
<i>Walter was in hiding.</i>

2253
01:57:23,633 --> 01:57:27,467
<i>The Octa show was a setup</i>
<i>to expose him to the public.</i>

2254
01:57:30,633 --> 01:57:32,758
<i>And you were right</i>
<i>about the Horsemen.</i>

2255
01:57:32,758 --> 01:57:37,675
<i>They needed to learn</i>
<i>to work together like</i>
<i>a single organism.</i>

2256
01:57:45,383 --> 01:57:47,967
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

2257
01:57:47,967 --> 01:57:49,550
You're the Horsemen,
aren't you?

2258
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:52,633

2259
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,342
(LULA CHUCKLES)

2260
01:57:57,342 --> 01:58:00,967
DYLAN:  <i>But that can't be</i>
<i>what all this is about.</i>

2261
01:58:00,967 --> 01:58:02,967
You know,
the best tricks

2262
01:58:02,967 --> 01:58:05,508
work on many levels.

2263
01:58:05,508 --> 01:58:07,425
And the deepest one,

2264
01:58:07,425 --> 01:58:09,550
for me, at least,

2265
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:12,425
is this moment
right here.

2266
01:58:15,842 --> 01:58:17,508
I'm sorry, Dylan.

2267
01:58:18,008 --> 01:58:20,675
I miss your father.

2268
01:58:20,675 --> 01:58:24,383
30 years is a long time
to drag something
around, isn't it?

2269
01:58:24,383 --> 01:58:25,967
Yes, it is.

2270
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:37,342
So, now what?

2271
01:58:39,633 --> 01:58:42,592
Now I'm about
out of moves.
Oh...

2272
01:58:42,592 --> 01:58:46,425
Come on, you're the one
who said that you
believe that this road

2273
01:58:46,425 --> 01:58:48,342
lead to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

2274
01:58:48,342 --> 01:58:52,592
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

2275
01:58:53,008 --> 01:58:54,758
I am.

2276
01:58:58,425 --> 01:58:59,508
(CHUCKLES)

2277
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,008
It's your game now.

2278
01:59:03,008 --> 01:59:05,758
You play it however
you see fit.

2279
01:59:06,883 --> 01:59:09,342
My suggestion, however,

2280
01:59:09,342 --> 01:59:12,842
is that you find
yourself a successor.

2281
01:59:12,842 --> 01:59:14,800
Hi. Okay, so, um...

2282
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,967
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions.

2283
01:59:16,967 --> 01:59:18,925
Right?

2284
01:59:18,925 --> 01:59:20,758
Uh... By "a few,"
I think he means,
like, five million.

2285
01:59:20,758 --> 01:59:22,467
Yeah.
Well.

2286
01:59:22,467 --> 01:59:24,383
Good luck to you all.

2287
01:59:24,383 --> 01:59:25,967
What!
Okay. See,
that's not fair.

Come on.
That's not right.

2289
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,550
That's gonna make
me really angry!

(ALL CHATTERING)
Not right now.

2291
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,550
Oh, um,
by the way...

2292
01:59:33,675 --> 01:59:36,342
Pay no attention
to the curtain.

2293
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,508
There is a curtain.

2294
01:59:40,508 --> 01:59:41,883
Go, go, go.

2296
01:59:53,842 --> 01:59:55,758
<i>But is it truth?</i>

2297
01:59:55,758 --> 01:59:58,508
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

2298
01:59:58,508 --> 02:00:01,008
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

2299
02:00:01,008 --> 02:00:03,050
<i>When you emerge,</i>

2300
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:05,508
<i>and you will,</i>

<i>But very much deserve.</i>

<i>is an eye</i>
