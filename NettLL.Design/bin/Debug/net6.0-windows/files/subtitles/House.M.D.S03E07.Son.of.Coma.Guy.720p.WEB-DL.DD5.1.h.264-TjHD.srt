<i>MAN.: See you Tuesday.</i>
<i>WOMAN.: How about right now?</i>

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,410
<i>What? What?</i>

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,440
<i>You wanna throw in the towel?</i>

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,040
<i>No, I don't wanna</i>
<i>throw in the... towel!</i>

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,980
<i>I thought</i>
<i>that's what you said!</i>

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,890
<i>I'm not upset about anything!</i>

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,380
<i>Where the... are we going?</i>

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,780
What are you doing
down here?

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,630
I thought you usually
had lunch with Coma Guy.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,500
This is Vegetative State Guy.
Better company.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,040
Hey, hey, tell him
about those Sherpas

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,370
you dropped acid with
in Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,210
You stole my prescription pad
and you forged my name.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,780
What did you tell the cop?
I lied.

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,310
They'd have put you away
for 10 years,

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,650
after they took your license
to practice medicine.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,980
So, everything's good, then.

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,080
I lied. To the cops.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,850
There is no case
unless they can prove

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,760
that either
I got the drugs illegally
or I sold them illegally.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,060
I didn't do the second,
you lied about the first.
Game over.

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,720
Yeah, Tritter's just playing.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,460
He's gonna see
how clever you are
and then just walk away.

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,130
The important thing is
that you keep prescribing

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,970
the same amount of drugs to me
or it'll look suspicious.

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,300
Here's another way
to look at it,

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,310
having forced me
to lie to the police,

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,670
your first concern
is securing
your drug connection.

(DOOR OPENING)

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,270
Joining my father for lunch?

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,280
I should have called ahead
for a table.

34
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,480
Dr. House was just...

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,220
Enjoying a Reuben.

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,750
It's okay.

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,960
After 10 years,
anything that'll get doctors
in the same room as...

38
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,400
What are you doing?
Nothing.

39
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,230
What are you doing?

40
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,830
Chips?

41
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,700
Wanna see something
really cool?

42
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,720
I saw you leaving
last Tuesday.

43
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,520
You practically
tripped over two guys
on your way out,

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,520
but you had no problem
opening doors.

45
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,290
It's called akinetopsia.

46
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,590
You can't see things
when they move.

47
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,100
Now, since you haven't been
hit by a bus, I assume
that it's intermittent.

48
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,530
It's probably
accompanied by seizures,

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,060
which made me think that
I could set one off
by flashing the...

50
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,210
God, I love this family.

51
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,950
I can see fine now.

52
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,720
I've had seizures before.
Most of the time
they're small.

53
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,350
Doctors ran me through
all the tests.
Couldn't find anything.

54
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,690
Any history of epilepsy
in your family?

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,750
The only things I know
that run in my family are

56
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,530
a lot of chutzpah
and the ability to sleep
for 10 years.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,440
Although
I'm not really an expert.

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,560
Dad never really liked
my mother's side
of the family,

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,740
and after she died
and he came here
I was raised by a guardian.

60
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,940
I wouldn't even know
how to get in touch with them.

61
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,570
How about your father's side
of the family?

62
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,050
Any relatives
we could speak with?

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
My father was an only child.

64
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,120
And my grandparents
are dead.

65
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,380
Well, who did you put down

66
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,250
as the person the hospital
should contact
in an emergency?

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,380
I left it blank.

68
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,120
There's gotta be someone,
a friend...

69
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,390
I have plenty of friends.

70
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,990
Just no one that would care
if I was here.

71
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,260
Say, do you mind passing me
my backpack?

72
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,000
(CLINKING)

73
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,080
Hair of the dog.

74
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,380
CAMERON: Could be infection.
FOREMAN: Or a brain tumor.

75
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,580
Says he had a CT.

76
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,750
What's wrong
with the simplest explanation?
Trauma?

77
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,090
He didn't report any injuries.

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,220
He didn't report
being an alcoholic, either.

79
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,890
Drinking equals falling down
equals trauma equals...

80
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,060
Maybe it's inherited.

81
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,660
How would you jump to genetics
from his EEG?

82
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,470
All you've got
are some vaguely
epileptiform waves.

83
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,840
It's not his EEG.
It's his father's.

84
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,880
When it comes
to cortical seizures,
like father, like son.

85
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,510
Small seizures
aren't unheard of

86
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,980
in a patient
in a vegetative state.

87
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,640
Similarities
are interesting, though.

88
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,310
What caused
the vegetative state?

89
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,120
His house burned down.

90
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,790
Went back in to get his wife,

91
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,450
firefighters
found him unconscious

92
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,590
three feet from the bedroom,
asphyxiated.

93
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,490
Not an inherited condition.

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,300
Test his DNA.
Start with
adrenomyeloneuropathy.

95
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,600
Check out the home.

96
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,610
He has a single bed.

97
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,980
They still make single beds?

98
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,950
It could mean
he just doesn't have sex,

99
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,420
though there were condoms
in the apartment.

100
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,520
House asked you
to check out
the home for toxins.

101
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,990
No mold, no leaks, no pets.

102
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,220
MRI and LP
are both inconclusive.

103
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,190
Infection's still possible,
tumor's less likely, but...

104
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,290
DNA?
The adrenomyeloneuropathy test

105
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,350
was negative.

106
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,590
DNA test again.

107
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,860
Try Unverricht-Lundborg
and late-onset Lafora's.

108
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,330
CHASE: Genetic tests
take forever.

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,530
You can't just keep testing
for every inherited condition
you think it might be.

110
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,630
Well, not me.
I'll be leaving early.
But you guys can.

111
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,170
You said no one's been sick
but what about
delivery people, repair guy?

112
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,810
I wouldn't know.
I work from home.

113
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,080
Haven't been to the office
in over a month.

114
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,310
CAMERON: Visitors?

115
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,620
Haven't had any.

116
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,560
The only person
I've seen in the last week

117
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,990
was the pizza delivery guy
and he looked pretty healthy.

118
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,160
There's gotta be someone
you're close to.

119
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,230
Actually, the person
I see most often
is my father.

120
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,300
He's asleep
so he can't stop me.

121
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,770
(GROANS)

122
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,940
What is it?

123
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,450
I'm just feeling
a little nauseous.

124
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,410
I think his liver's failing.

125
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,350
God. Does that mean
that I'm...

126
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,550
We need a central line kit,

127
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,790
two units of
packed red blood cells
type O Negative.

128
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,290
He's unconscious
and heading for a coma.

129
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,300
He's at a four
on the RLAS scale.

130
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,740
Stop all treatment.

131
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,310
You think this is a reaction
to our meds?

132
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,570
Well, they're obviously
not helping.

133
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,210
Given the fact
that he's an alcoholic,

134
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,580
there's a good chance
his liver wasn't so hot
when he came in.

135
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,980
Anti-seizure drugs
could have just pushed him
over the edge.

136
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,650
We take him off those meds,
what do we put him on?

137
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,810
I was hoping you'd know.

138
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,190
It may be academic,
I just started him
on dialysis.

139
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,090
Kidney and liver failure.
Not too many people
come back from that.

140
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,360
Trauma's out of the picture.
Could still be infection.

141
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,660
Or neurological...
Or genetic.

142
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,000
We need a better history.

143
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,100
Did you miss the part
where the patient
lost consciousness?

144
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,540
L-dopa?

145
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,040
You're not waking Kyle.
You're waking his father.

146
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,140
I commend
your observational skills.

147
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,340
You have no reason to think

148
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,720
any amount of drugs
will wake a man from a coma.

149
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,620
Vegetative state.
Much easier.

150
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,560
This guy's no Terry Schiavo,
his brain's all there,
he moves around,

151
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,320
his muscles
have barely atrophied.

152
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,690
He's just waiting
for a fairy-tale kiss.

153
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,320
After I do that,
I'll stick a needle in him.

154
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,330
The amount
of amphetamines alone
would be dangerous,

155
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,600
besides
whatever the hell else
you've got in there.

156
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,770
There are reports
out of South Africa

157
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,140
about a pill that would
temporarily revive someone
in a vegetative state.

158
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,810
You've all seen <i>Awakenings,</i>
made me cry.

159
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,640
I wanna cry.

160
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,810
CUDDY: Put the syringe down.

161
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,190
I can outdraw you,
mysterious stranger.

162
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,380
We don't experiment
on helpless patients.

163
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,760
Be reasonable.
There's no way
this is gonna work.

164
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,530
Even if you woke him,
it would only be
for a few hours.

165
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,430
A day, two at the most.

166
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,900
You're risking his life.

167
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,770
I'm risking getting sued,
that's the only
objection here.

168
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,310
You'll be torturing him
and his family.

169
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,810
Well, good news for Legal,
the only family
he's got is upstairs dying.

170
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,210
Hey!

171
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,020
I want this patient monitored
for the next 24 hours.

172
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,820
I want someone with him
at all times

173
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,320
to make sure
you didn't kill him.

174
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,620
I want your ass in my office.

175
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,960
(MOANING)

176
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,170
God, I'm starving.

177
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,160
I could really go for a steak.

178
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,780
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you are?

179
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,910
Gabriel Wozniak.
I don't know the name
of this hospital.

180
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,180
How much are three and five?

181
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,110
Eight.

182
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,320
Also known as half of 16,
a quarter of 32,
two to the third power.

183
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,190
Coolest thing ever.

184
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,560
Any history of seizure
in your family?

185
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,400
No.
Liver disease?

186
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,490
No.

187
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,800
How long have I been here?
I...

188
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,630
I got the feeling
it's been a long time.

189
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,730
Interesting.

190
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,140
Your internal clock
kept ticking.

191
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,740
How deep
does that awareness go?

192
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,210
Pick up scraps
of conversations?

193
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,410
Do you have the vague sense

194
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,470
that the
hospital administrator
dresses like a trollop?

195
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,040
Or that the new
<i>Star Wars</i> movies
were a disappointment?

196
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,150
I know my wife is dead.

197
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,520
I don't know
how long it's been.

198
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,740
Ten years.

199
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,140
What's the last thing
you remember?

200
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,780
The fire.

201
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,640
My wife was in the bedroom,
she had taken a sleeping pill.

202
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,620
I got Kyle out,
went back in for her.

203
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,520
I knew I didn't make it.

204
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,790
What about your wife's side
of the family?
Any history of seizures there?

206
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,630
Your son Kyle
is a patient here.

207
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,730
I'm afraid
his condition is serious.
He may be dying.

208
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,710
No seizure issues
on my wife's side, either.

209
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,470
What about that steak?
Nobody ever answered me.

210
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,410
(EXCLAIMS)

211
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,820
Rumor in the cafeteria
was Caustic Guy
was waking up Coma Guy.

212
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,590
Technically,
Vegetative State Guy

213
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,990
was woken by,
yeah, Caustic Guy.

214
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,120
So what happened?

215
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,360
I gotta get him a steak
before I can ask him
any more questions.

216
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,870
He doesn't wanna talk
about his son?

217
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,840
Didn't seem
to emotionally register
that his son is sick.

218
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,960
Brain issue?

219
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,700
He was asphyxiated,
spent 10 years as asparagus,

220
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,940
who knows
what damage is in there.
It's possible.

221
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,240
Of course there's always
the simple explanation.

222
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,470
Maybe he just
doesn't like his son.

223
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,650
Only in your world
would that be simple.

224
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,780
The delusion
that fathering a child

225
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,190
installs a permanent geyser
of unconditional love...

226
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,850
Maybe your father's feelings
were conditional,
not everyone's.

227
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,980
Well, of course,
that would play into

228
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,460
your romantic vision
of human...

229
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,930
In terms
you would understand,

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,590
we have
an evolutionary incentive

231
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,130
to sacrifice
for our offspring.

232
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,290
Our tribe, our friends.
Keep them safe.

233
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,830
Except for all the people
who don't.

234
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,000
Everything is conditional.

235
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,970
You just can't always
anticipate the conditions.

236
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,050
Mind if we talk
for a few minutes?

237
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,980
How many pills would you say
Dr. House takes a day?

238
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,220
I'm uncomfortable
setting a number.

239
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,790
Well, try.

240
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,200
Six.

241
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,760
A day?

242
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,180
Has he ever had you
write prescriptions for him?

243
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,000
No. What is it
you want me to say?

244
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,380
That he takes too many pills
and is a danger
to the hospital,

245
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,820
or he takes too few
because
he's selling them on the side?

246
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,610
Either one is ridiculous.

247
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,780
I meant the former.

248
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,320
You're wrong.

249
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,450
Can I ask
what Dr. House has done
to deserve your loyalty?

250
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,590
He's not known
as a great boss.

251
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,190
He's not even
much of a friend.

252
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,330
Look how he left
Dr. Wilson holding the bag.

253
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,500
It's odd.
You don't know about that?

254
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,840
You defend him,
and he won't even tell you
what's happening in his life.

255
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,110
(PAGER BEEPING)

256
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,260
I was paged.

257
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,390
We saw you with the cop.

258
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,620
What'd he want?

259
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,130
How many pills
does House take,

260
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,500
did I ever write him
a prescription?

261
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,030
That sort of stuff.

262
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,170
I told him six.
A day or in a mouthful?

263
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,210
I was just hoping
you guys
would stay consistent with...

264
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,900
He wants to talk to us, too?

265
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,370
You're next.

266
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,870
We've gotta tell House
what's going on.

267
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,810
Tritter says no.
Then no it is.

268

to make life

What's the kid's status?

270
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,650
I gotta get back
to our sleeper

271
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,520
before he goes looking
for the orgasmatron.

272
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,090
See, if that were rhetorical,

273
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,150
it would mean
that I can just turn around
and leave now,

274
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,960
which I'm not doing,
from which
you should deduce...

275
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,370
He's off all drugs
except the antibiotics.

276
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,370
His liver's just managing
to hang in there.

277
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,630
He's still sliding into coma.

Your barber sucks.

279
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,190
Hey, Coma Diet,

280
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,660

282
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,930
Who gave you your clothes?

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,330
Dr. Cuddy.

284
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,590
I guess I'll need
all new ones, anyway.

285
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,230
Everything went in the fire.

286
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,430
Don't worry about it.

287

We use recyclable clothes now.
Wear them once, then eat them.

Your son's
measles vaccination,

289
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,670
do you remember if he had it,
what type it was?

290
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,270
Man, you're a piece of work,
you know that?

291
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,910
You weren't gonna tell me,
were you?

292
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,970
I don't need new clothes.

293
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,890
Dr. Cuddy says
my body
will adjust to the drugs,

294
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,950
that I'll be
a vegetable again
by tomorrow.

295

If I'm really lucky,
the day after.

296
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,980
Yeah.

If I've got a day to live,

298
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,900
I'm not gonna spend it
in a hospital room
being grilled.

299

Come on, where you gonna go?

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,530
Your house burned down,
your wife's dead.
Business was sold off.

301
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,740
The only thing you have left
is down the hall,
heading for a liver biopsy.

302
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,870
Used to be this little
hole in the wall
run by a guy named Giancarlo.

How far is Atlantic City
from here?

You have one day to live,
and you want a sandwich?

308
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,890
People on death row
get a last meal.

309
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,160
The state provides it.
Who's providing for you?

310
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,370
You got a car? Money?

311
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,070
You're negotiating with me.

312
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,440
Take out another 100 for me.
And I need your car.

313
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,250
I'm not doing you any favors.

314
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,920
You'll get it back tomorrow.
Two days, max.

315
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,790
Road trip.

316
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,790
This is like trying
to control the weather,

317
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,000
but I'd prefer it
if you didn't eat in the car,

318
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,500
I just had it detailed.

319
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,340
I drive.
Oh, the hell he does.

320
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,530
Sure.

321
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,380
Aside from the fact
he just woke up
from a vegetative state,

322
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,540
the guy doesn't
have a license.

323
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,410
How about this?
Cops stop us, we lie.

324
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,880
You know how to do that.
Chips.

325
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,750
It's all the drugs
pumping through his system.

326
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,520
Right now his reflexes
are better
than Dale Earnhardt Jr's.

327
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,150
What's this? It says ipod.

328
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,830
I'm coming.

329
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,470
HOUSE: So let's talk about
toxic exposure.

330
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,840
What was wrong
with the old colors?
I trusted brown.

331
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,480
Do the purple ones
have chocolate inside?

332
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,020
Raspberry cocaine.

333
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,020
This house that burned down,
where was it?

00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,390
Moorestown, New Jersey.

Listen, I really need to know
about the candy because
I'm allergic to berries.

336
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,390
You didn't mention that.

337
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,800
Is it significant?

338
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,270
No. So where else
did you live?

339
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,270
List everywhere,
including vacations,

340
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,070
start with
when your wife got pregnant.

341
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,670
We lived in Jersey.
Then we moved to Jersey,
from there, Jersey.

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,800
What are you waiting to hear?
About the little cottage
in the Amazon

343
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,140
with the mosquitoes
and the lead paint
all over the walls?

344
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,270
Yes.

345
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,040
You know what?

346
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,250
I didn't let you come along
so you could suck all the fun
out of my one day of life.

347
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,690
Well, you're outta luck,
because
that's totally why I'm here.

348
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,650
Okay, rule change.

349
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,190
Person with the money
makes the rules.
Or in this case,

350
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,720
the person who's friends
with the person with the money
makes the rules.

351
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,430
Well, you want answers
more than I want money.

352
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,640
All right, so here's the game.

353
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,270
Ask whatever you want.

354
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,900
But for every question
I answer,
you have to answer one first.

355
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,180
Why would you care
about anything I have to say?

356
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,510
The day before I died,
I was a successful man.

357
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,590
I had a factory
with over 200 employees.

358
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,590
People listened when I talked.

359
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,890
I liked power.

360
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,460
Now, the only power
I have left
is the power to annoy you.

361
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,670
I took Wilson's assistant
for coffee.

362
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,210
Why?
Something Tritter said.

363
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,580
She told me the police think

364
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,380
that House stole
Wilson's prescription pad
and forged his name.

365
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,080
You believe it?

366
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,320
Do you?
Well, absolutely I do.

367
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,980
I'm just checking
how naive you are.

368
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,690
He's not gonna
steal his best friend's pad,
jeopardize his career.

369
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,790
Until his best friend
says no to him.

370
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,090
House is a junkie.

371
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,400
Junkies do
whatever they have to do
to get what they need.

372
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,130
Kyle's down to a three
on the RLAS scale.

373
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,970
He's only showing
localized response.

374
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,570
I'll call House,
tell him we're gonna need
an answer soon.

375
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,310
Get in your right lane
for 295.

376
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,750
And pass me the Twizzlers.

377
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,620
I'm curious...
No, you're not.

378
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,280
Why would
a man's first instinct

379
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,420
be to drive away
from the only family
he's got?

380
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,470
No, this is no time
for you to do your thing.

381
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,090
We don't care
about his state of mind,
we don't care if he's happy.

382
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,640
This factory of yours,
what did you make?

383
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
So ask me a question.

384
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,940
I'm thinking.

385
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,770
Only six left, by the way.

386
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,470
So sign my name.
You don't need a doctor,
you need a pen.

387
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,850
What is up with you two?

388
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,250
Wilson lied to the bulls
to keep me
out of the big house.

389
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,550
Are you out of your mind?

390
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,250
Well, who's he gonna tell?

391
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,590
By tomorrow night
he's gonna be
a mindless stalk of celery.

392
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,660
Since I answered that one,
by the way, my turn.

393
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,100
What did you make
in your factory?

394
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,600
Luxury boats.

395
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,130
Have you ever been in love?

396
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,290
Wow!

397
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,100
Going right for the closets
with the embarrassing stuff.
Good move.

398
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,160
Yes. Describe the boats.

399
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,080
Thirty-five to 65-foot hulls,
twin engines,
parquet floors in the galley,

400
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,240
staterooms with queen beds.

401
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,280
How'd you meet?
She shot me.

402
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,240
These boats, I assume you used
mildew-resistant paint
on the hulls?

403
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,950
Naturally. Shot you?

404
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,820
Paintball.
Doctors versus lawyers.

405
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,990
Did you ever take
your son to the factory?
Sure.

406
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,430
He used to run
all over the place,
but it was perfectly safe.

407
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,090
Ever love anybody else?

408
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,770
No more questions,
I got my answer.

409
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,500
While Dad's in the office,
his son's
watching them spray-paint.

410
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,440
And what kid wears a mask?

411
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,240
Mercury specifically targets
the central nervous system.

412
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,470
You're saying
this is my fault?

413
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,810
Mercury poisoning
explains the seizures

414
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,820
and the liver's like
a big soup strainer.

415
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,350
The soup runs through,
chicken dumplings stay.

416
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,120
For soup, read blood,
for chicken...

417
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,680
I get it, I get it. Mercury.

418
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,950
Sits more or less idle

419
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,330
until your kid
pours tequila shooters
into his liver.

420
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,160
When the liver goes,
takes out the kidneys,
explains everything.

421
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,260
Yeah, it's me.

422
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,270
<i>Foreman, draw blood.</i>
<i>Test for mercury poisoning.</i>

423
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,330
Chase,
start heavy metal chelation

424
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,200
while we're waiting
for results.

425
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,710
Chase isn't here.
I'll start the...

426
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,940
Where is he?

427
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,940
The lab.

428
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,920
How many pills
does he take a day?

429
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,820
It's hard to say,
pain levels vary over time...

430
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,990
Could be six, eight, 10.

431
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,330
Ever write
any prescriptions for him?

432
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,960
Yes.
Why?

433
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,730
Did he tell you to?

434
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,760
He asked me to.

435
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,540
Medicine attracts people
who are attracted to power.

436
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,380
I know how he hates
when he is defied
by a patient.

437
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,020
I doubt he handles defiance
from his staff any better.

438
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,080
Now you correct me
if I'm wrong,

439
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,790
but I don't think
Dr. House asks for anything.

440
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,760
I think he takes it.

441
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,790
And I think that you are stuck
lying to the police

442
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,510
to cover up something
you didn't wanna do.

443
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,910
HOUSE: We have been
up and down St. James
like a Monopoly car.

444
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,190
It's not here.
Giancarlo has
left the building.

445
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,390
We can still turn around
and go back to Princeton.

446
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,200
No. We've come this far,
I'm getting the hoagie.

447
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,470
If your son does
have mercury poisoning,

448
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,340
there's a good chance
he'll respond
to the chelation.

449
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,770
You might be able to have
a few minutes with him
before you lapse.

450
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,140
Why are you so concerned
about me?

451
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,180
Deep inside Wilson believes
that if he cares enough

452
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,950
he'll never have to die.

453
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,650
Your behavior isn't normal.

454
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,550
And you would know normal?

455
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,850
What could he have done
that you won't forgive
after 10 years?

456
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,990
When this
is your last chance?

457
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,360
My son is what he is.

458
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,230
His mother's side,
all drunken losers.

459
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,370
He's gone the same way.

460
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,710
House told you drinking
had damaged your son's liver.

461
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,970
I just said that.

462
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,440
But you didn't hear
him say that

463
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,410
until after
we left the hospital.

464
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,310
So why did you leave?

465
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,690
Maybe your son
takes after your side.

466
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,050
Seizures and an allergy
to emotional connections.

467
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,920
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

468
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,000
We're in Atlantic City
and my time's not up yet.

469
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,590
We find a hotel
with a casino.

470
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,530
(MACHINE BEEPING)

471
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,160
BP's starting to drop.

472
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,470
O2-sat's down to 70.

473
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,780
Point-three milligrams
of epi in.

474
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,580
What are you trying to do,
make him bleed faster?

475
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,350
Check the pulse.

476
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,780
It's not his liver.

477
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,480
It's the heart.

478
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,280
WILSON: I understand
he's a French chef

479
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,260
but I'm sure
he can handle this.

480
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,300
You need a 12-inch
Italian roll,

481
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,600
oregano vinegar,
no, not balsamic vinegar,
oregano vinegar.

482
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,770
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

483
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,600
Game's still on.

484
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,970
I thought the answer
was mercury poisoning.

485
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,030
What other questions
would you care about?

486
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,240
If you each had
one day to live,

487
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,110
you'd look for one last meal
and House would look
for one last answer.

488
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,280
WILSON: No, can you just
send the ingredients up here

489
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,380
and I'll make it myself.

490
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,890
Last 10 years,
how much awareness
did you have?

491
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,860
I don't know,
I knew it wasn't the next day.

492
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,400
I knew that...

493
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,260
I recognized your voice.

494
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,070
How often were you in my room?

495
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,370
No, you're wasting a question.

496
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,910
I have a better one.

497
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,200
Why steal my pad?

498
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,070
Oh, my God, you're right.
I'm an addict.

499
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,700
Thanks for opening my eyes.

500
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,650
No, I mean why my pad?

501
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,050
Foreman, Cameron
and Chase's pads
are just as convenient.

502
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,060
But their association
with you is involuntary,
they're employees.

503
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,020
I associate with you
through choice

504
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,790
and any relationship
that involves choice

505
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,520
you have to see
how far you can push
before it breaks.

506
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
This is easy.

507
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,560
You ask the questions,
answer them
and make tasty snacks.

508
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,190
Let's go try the casino.

509
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,170
And one day
our friendship will break

510
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,700
and that'll just prove
your theory that relationships
are conditional

511
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,440
and you don't need
human connection
or deserve it,

512
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:52,710
or whatever goes on
in that
rat-maze of your brain.

513
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,940
Sorry, if I'd known
he was gonna be this annoying,

514
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,680
I would have stolen
Dr. Cameron's pad

515
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,450
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)
And Dr. Foreman's car.

516
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,620
At least she appreciates
my brooding melancholy.

517
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,860
House's House of Whining,
state your complaint.

518
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,520
The patient's BP
just dropped like a stone.

519
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,620
<i>Do an echo.</i>

520
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,130
Mercury isn't likely
to damage the...

521
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,260
<i>It didn't.</i>

522
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,360
Mercury test was negative.

523
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,540
Do an echo.

524
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,880
I was wrong.
Your son's still dying.

525
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,450
I need to go over
every relative
you ever had. Again.

526
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,780
And this time,
forget their diseases,
just tell me how they died.

527
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,850
And we don't have time
to take turns.

528
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,150
You give me the answers,
you get a big one at the end.

529
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,690
You can go
for whatever you want.

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,230

my dignity.

00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,200
Heat exhaustion,

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,760
The woman was 92.

534
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,170
Does anyone in the kitchen
know the hoagie shop

535
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,010
that used to be
on St. James Place?

536
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,340
You sister-in-law
with the diabetes.

537
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,280
As far as you know,
is she still alive?
She's not.

538
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,510
She was killed
in a traffic accident

539
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,180
driving home
from a Phillies game.

540
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,850
I'm sure a lot of beer
was consumed.

541
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,790
The Phillies lost.
Your father?

542
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,050
Old age.
Heart finally gave out.

543
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,450
Your wife's father?

544
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,190
Hit-and-run,
walking the incontinent dog.

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,990
Hi, do you guys deliver?

546
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,590
Let me put it this way,

547
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,730
if you deliver, there'll be
a $100 tip in it for you.

548
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,970
Excellent.

549
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,600
Victory.
The night
is finally going my way.

550
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,910
Wilson, toss me a soda.

551
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,690
Shall we go somewhere
to talk?

552
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,900
House is an ass.

553
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,090
But he obviously needs
pain medication,

554
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,570
and how much pain
one person feels

555
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,100
is not a call
the government
should be making.

556
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,260
So you think
I'm a bureaucrat
with a badge

557
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,540
following
some arbitrary guideline.

558
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,440
Yeah, I do.

559
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,340
So you're saying
I should just trust him.
Do you?

560
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,880
You're not qualified
to make that...

561
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,890
I'm not sure
you are, either.

562
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,920
I've been a cop for 20 years.

563
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,050
And not a day goes by

564
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,580
that someone doesn't try
to sell me
some self-serving story.

565
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,330
If you had my job,
you'd know.

566
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,430
Everybody lies.

567
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,800
I think
you've run out of relatives.

568
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,210
So, it's my turn.

569
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,220
Why did you become a doctor?

570
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,680
That's the big question?

571
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,460
I give you complete license
to humiliate me

572
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,890
and that's the best
you can do.

573
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,090
Well, okay, let's discuss
the wonder of the human body.

574
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,360
No, no, no.
You're a curious guy.

575
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,830
You like to figure things out,
why not go into research?

576
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,530
Why work with people when you

577
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,030
obviously hate people?

578
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,160
Oedipal fixation.

579
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,640
I was seeking
my mother's love

580
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,800
and she thought that Ben Casey
was just the dreamiest...

581
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Okay, fine. You don't think
you'll need
any more answers from me?

582
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,380
Give me a hard time.

583
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,220
When I was 14,

584
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,930
my father was stationed
in Japan.

585
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,330
I went rock-climbing
with this kid from school.

586
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,930
He fell and got injured
and I had to bring him
to the hospital.

587
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,530
And we came in through
the wrong entrance

588
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,630
and passed this guy
in the hall.

589
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,610
He was a janitor.

590
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,940
My friend came down
with an infection

591
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,210
and the doctors didn't know
what to do.

592
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,620
So they brought in

593
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,690
the janitor.

594
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,020
He was a doctor.

595
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,500
And a <i>buraku.</i>

596
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,100
One of Japan's untouchables.

597
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,200
His ancestors
had been slaughterers,
gravediggers.

598
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,740
And this guy,

599
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,210
he knew that he wasn't
accepted by the staff,
didn't even try.

600
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,510
He didn't dress well,
he didn't pretend
to be one of them.

601
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,850
The people around that place,

602
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,550
they didn't think
he had anything they wanted,

603
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,690
except when they needed him.

604
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,890
Because he was right.

605
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,300
Which meant
that nothing else mattered.

606
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,670
And they had to listen to him.

607
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,110

Better hope so.

or his heart's done.

on the night of the fire?

00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,540
Yeah. I'm sure
it's a stressful,
emotional question.

My wife
had taken a sleeping pill
and gone to bed.

00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,820
It was Christmas Eve.

620
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,830
I let Kyle pop corn
in the fireplace.

621
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,960
He managed to knock loose
some tinder.

You act as though
you don't need anybody,
you...

You just blame your son
for what happened.

629
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,790
I don't blame him.
He was a 12-year-old boy.

630
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,800
You don't blame a kid
for an accident.

631
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,730
Then what are we doing here?
Why aren't you with him?

632
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,600
Because it wouldn't matter.

it was too heavy,

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,840
It's an inherited condition.

00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,460
so it only passes
through the mother.

Your wife's family
weren't drunks,
they were sick.

It wouldn't have

The kid is a drunk.

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,630
He thinks that
he killed his mother

656
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,800
and turned his father
into a vegetable.

maybe someone'll come up

Except he isn't near death,
he's saying, "Kill me
and cut out my heart."

682
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

683
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,610
Fine.
I'll think of something else.

684
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,680
I'm sorry.

685
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,290
Wilson, get out.

686
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,700
No.

687
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,110
You lied to the cops
enough for me.

688
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,980
Maybe I don't wanna
push this till it breaks.

689
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,510
Pills are the simplest.

690
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,910
Hanging has less chance
of damaging the heart.

691
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,220
I'm okay with pain.

692
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,790
Strangulation is better
than breaking your neck,

693
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,300
which means this'll be slow.

694
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,240
I wouldn't get to see him
even if we got in the car
right now

695
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:56,370
and broke
the speed limit driving back,
would I?

696
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,540
No.

697
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,010
Tell him...

698
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,290
I don't know
what to tell him.

699
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,590
(SIGHS)

700
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,560
I think it's my turn
to ask a question, isn't it?

701
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,000
I don't think so.

702
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,570
'Cause you just asked me
that thing
about the speed limit.

703
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,210
What do you wanna know?

704
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,250
If you could hear one thing
from your father,
what would it be?

705
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,990
It wouldn't help you.

706
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,250
Try me.

707
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,330
I'd want him to say,

708
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,360
"You were right.

709
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,670
"You did the right thing."

710
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,010
Yeah. It doesn't help.

711
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,860
Hi.
Hi.

712
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,620
I'm Dr. Wilson.

713
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,890
I'm Mrs. Schaffer.

714
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,700
I'm from Princeton.

715
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,270
My husband and I
and our three children
live in Philadelphia.

716
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,010
So, do you like to swing?

717
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,920
No.

718
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,420
Well, if you
change your mind, I'm in...

719
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,880
House? House?

720
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,400
Is it room 622, 642?

721
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,020
622.

722
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,760
622.

723
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,560
Yeah.

724
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,680
Alibi.

725
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,680
I figured.

726
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,600
(THUMPING)

727
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,070
They found
an open bottle of aspirin
by the body.

728
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,110
Lucky he had a headache,
reduced trauma
to the heart in transit.

729
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,150
Lucky.

730
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,660
That can't be all.

731
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,160
Well, you got a heart
out of it.

732
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,290
How many organs
do you want from the guy?

733
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,890
I mean, my father
must have said something.

734
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,300
He couldn't just...

735
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,540
He must have given you
some kind of a message for me.

736
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,650
He said you were right.

737
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,780
You did the right thing.

738
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,820
Right about what?

739
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,530
What does that mean?

740
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,430
How would I know?
He's your dad.

741
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,120
You know
what I found interesting
about this case?

742
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,080
That it proved
that people
can love unconditionally

743
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,850
and you can tell yourself
it's not true,

744
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,480
but you'll just end up
in a hotel room
in Atlantic City

745
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,150
asking someone
to cut your heart out?

746
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,290
(MACHINE BEEPING)
The hoagie.

747
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,660
You thought this guy
was emotionally confused,

748
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,430
and that the hoagie
was just a mask

749
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,230
to hide his real feelings
toward his son.

750
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,530
It was.

751
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,630
Did you know Tritter
was talking to your team
while we were away?

752
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,700
Yeah.

753
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,640
And yet you moved
Heaven and Earth

754
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,700
to get him that mask
with mustard and prosciutto.

755
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,340
Which one of them told you?

756
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,440
All of them.

757
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,140
Which means that none of them
said anything
I have to worry about.

758
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,550
(MACHINE BEEPING)
Back to the hoagie.

759
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,680
You think that
my addiction's out of hand.

760
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,660
Your need to be needed
is so strong that you'll
give people what they want,

761
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,460
what they need,
what they think they need.

762
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,330
I don't think my enabling
is anything you should be
complaining about.

763
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,960
Yes, my name
is Dr. James Wilson,

764
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,230
account number 835687.

765
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,340
The ATM says
I've got zero...

766
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,940
What does that mean, a hold?

767
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,210
Yeah, okay, thanks.

768
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,510
(SIGHS)

769
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,550
My accounts have been frozen
as part of
a police investigation.

770
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,060
They can't keep
your money forever.

771
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,660
No, they can keep it
till I agree to help send
you to prison for 10 years.

772
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,840
You're getting dinner.
