1
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,117
Like a good, little soldier?

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:05,751
Are you that desperate
for his approval?

3
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:06,852
This isn't you talking,
Sam.

4
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:08,254
That's the difference
between you and me.

5
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:11,857
I have a mind of my own.
I'm not pathetic like you.

6
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:13,293
Before dad died,
he told me something.

7
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:14,827
He said that I might
have to kill you, Sam.

8
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:17,030
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- I don't know.

9
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:18,464
We're talking
about the Colt, right?

10
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:19,598
If you are still set

11
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,834
On the insane task
of killing the devil,

12
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:23,269
This is how we do it.

13
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:24,938
- You guys are larping, aren't you?
- Excuse me?

14
00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:26,172
Live-action
role-playing.

15
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:27,706
- You're fans.
- Fans of what?

16
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:29,642
"Supernatural"
by Carver Edlund.

17
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:32,011
his name's Chuck Shurley.
and he's a genius.

18
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:33,179
I'm Dean.
this is Sam.

19
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:34,814
The Dean and Sam
you've been writing about.

20
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,515
I write things and then
they come to life.

21
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,484
- Obviously I'm a god.
- He's a prophet of the lord.

22
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:40,186
You. You're...

23
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,520
Carver Edlund, yeah.
Hi, Becky.

24
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:43,789
I am your number-one fan.

25
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,992
But I know that "Supernatural"
is just a book, okay?

26
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,194
- Becky, it's all real.
- I knew it!

27
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:49,295
You okay, lady?

28
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,365
Sam... is it really you?

29
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,269
- And you're so firm.
- Uhh...

30
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:19,025
Dean. come on!

31
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:27,100
Chuck!
there you are.

32
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:28,067
Guys.

33
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:29,102
What's going on?

34
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,269
Uh, nothing.

35
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:32,938
You know, just, um,
I was kind of hangin'.

36
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,374
What are you guys
doing here?

37
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:35,674
You told us to come.

38
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,343
Uh, no, I didn't.

39
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:38,677
Yeah, you did.
you texted me...

40
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:40,513
This address,
"life-or-death situation."

41
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:41,847
Any of this ringing a bell?

42
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:43,716
No, I-I-I didn't
send you a text.

43
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,051
We drove all night.

44
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,487
I'm sorry. I-I-I don't
understand what could...

45
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:50,089
- Oh, no.
- What?

46
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:53,026
Sam! you made it!

47
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,427
Ohh!

48
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,695
Oh, uh...

49
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,231
Becky, right?

50
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:00,900
Oh, you remembered.

51
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:03,769
You've been
thinking about me.

52
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:05,604
I...

53
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,972
It's okay.

54
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:08,607
I can't get you
out of my head, either.

55
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,243
Um, did you take my phone?

56
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:12,745
I just borrowed it.
from your pants.

57
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,914
- Becky.
- What?

58
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,482
They're gonna
want to see it.

59
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:17,383
- See what?
- See what?

60
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:18,817
Oh, my god.

61
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:21,220
I love it when they talk
at the same time!

62
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,589
Hey, chuck!
come on, pal. it's show time.

63
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:27,460
Guys, I'm sorry.

64
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,296
For everything.

65
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:37,970
# I just found my way #

66
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,441
# but that's all
I'm ever gonna change #

67
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:44,410
# and have a groggy day #

68
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:48,013
Hey, Dean!
lookin' good!

69
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,215
Who the hell are you?

70
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,385
I'm Dean, too.

71
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:53,752
Duh.

72
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,661
Uh-oh.
it's Sam and Dean.

73
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,131
I'm in trouble now.
have fun, you two.

74
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,203
# topsy-turvy, baby... #

75
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:11,304
What?

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,678
# I say, miss topsy-turvy
sure does got me in a spin #

77
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:21,680
# you got me... #

78
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:24,783
Becky, what is this?

79
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,018
It's awesome!

80
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:29,122
A "Supernatural" convention.
the first ever.

81
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:55,148
Welcome to the first annual
"Supernatural" convention.

82
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:58,551
At 3:45 in the magnolia room,

83
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,186
We have the panel

84
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,889
Frightened little boy.
The secret life of Dean."

85
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:05,358
And at 4:30,

86
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:08,561
There's the homo-erotic subtext
of "supernatural."

87
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:11,764
Oh, and, of course, the big hunt
starts at 7:00 p.m. sharp.

88
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:14,867
Whoo!

89
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,335
Okay, but... but right now...

90
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,205
Right now I'd like
to introduce the man himself.

91
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,009
The creator and the writer
of the "Supernatural" books,

92
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,579
The one, the only...

93
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:27,780
Carver Edlund!

94
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:41,727
Uh... oh.

95
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,597
Uh, okay, good.

96
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,865
This isn't nearly
as awkward as I...

97
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,235
it's a little dry mouth.

98
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:10,389
Okay, uh...

99
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:12,091
So, I guess, uh...

100
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,392
Questions?

101
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:17,330
Um, you?

102
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,399
Hey, Mr. Edlund.
uh, big fan.

103
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:22,268
Wow. okay.
I was just wondering...

104
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:27,506
Where'd you come up with Sam
and Dean in the first place?

105
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,842
Oh, uh, I, uh...

106
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,944
It just... came to me.

107
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:35,914
Okay, uh...

108
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,516
Yeah, the, uh...

109
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:38,751
Hook man.

110
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:40,519
Uh, yeah.

111
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:42,488
Why, in every fight scene,

112
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,523
Sam and Dean are having
their gun or knife

113
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:46,024
Knocked away
by the bad guy?

114
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:49,295
Why don't they keep it
on some kind of bungee?

115
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,264
Uh, uh...

116
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:52,632
Yeah, I-I-I really don't know.

117
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,333
Yeah, follow-up...

118
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,769
Why can't Sam and Dean
be telling that Ruby is evil?

119
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,771
I mean, she is clearly
manipulating Sam

120
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,374
Into some kind
of moral lapse.

121
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:02,775
It's obvious, nein?

122
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,944
Hey! if you don't like the
books, don't read 'em, Fritz!

123
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,546
Okay, okay, just, uh...

124
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,048
Uh, okay. it's okay.

125
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,584
So, uh, so, next question.

126
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:15,020
Uh, uh, y-yeah, you.

127
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:17,290
Yeah, at the end
of the last book,

128
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:18,491
Dean goes to hell.

129
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:20,626
So, what happens next?

130
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:25,130
Oh, w-well, there lies
an announcement, a-actually.

131
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:26,231
Um...

132
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,668
You're all gonna find out.

133
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:33,539
Um, thanks to a wealthy
Scandinavian investor...

134
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,140
We're gonna
start publishing again.

135
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:46,619
Sweet lord, yes!

136
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,696
I got you a yellow-eyed cooler.

137
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,096
Thanks, Chuck.

138
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:59,699
Sure.

139
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,001
So, Becky, uh...

140
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:05,003
I was wondering, um,
are you doing anyth...

141
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,005
Oh, hi, Sam!

142
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,244
Excuse us. In case you haven't
noticed, our plates are kind of full.

143
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:15,047
Okay? finding the colt,
hunting the devil.

144
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,615
We don't have time
for this crap!

145
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,317
Hey, I didn't call you.

146
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:20,052
He means the books, Chuck.

147
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:21,487
Why are you publishing
more books?

148
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,756
Um, for food and shelter?

149
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,392
Who gave you the rights
to our life story?

150
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,494
An archangel.
and I didn't want it.

151
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:30,396
Well, deals off, okay?
no more books.

152
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,431
Our lives are not
for public consumption.

153
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,304
Uh, Becky, would you
excuse us for just a second?

154
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,305
Uh-huh.

155
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,744
Do you guys know
what I do for a living?

156
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,011
Yeah, Chuck, we know.

157
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,847
Then, could you tell me?
'cause I don't.

158
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,147
All right, I'm not
a good writer,

159
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,116
I've got no
marketable skills,

160
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,752
I'm not some hero
who can just hit the road

161
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,820
And fight monsters, okay?

162
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:57,990
Until the world ends,
I got to live, all right?

163
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:00,092
And the "Supernatural" books
are all I've got.

164
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:02,060
What else do you
want me to do?

165
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,066
No. guys! wait!

166
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,071
Hey, lady.
hey, you okay?

167
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:14,707
- I think so.
- What happened?

168
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:17,309
- I saw a ghost.
- A ghost?

169
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:19,044
Ma'am, could you tell us
what it looked like?

170
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:20,813
Why don't you leave this
to the grown-ups, pal?

171
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:22,014
A woman.

172
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,682
She was in
an old-fashioned dress.

173
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:25,117
Really old.

174
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:26,685
like a schoolmarm
or something.

175
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,353
did she say
something to you?

176
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,289
Okay.

177
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,124
Gather close, everybody,

178
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,460
For a terrifying tale
of terror!

179
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:37,663
I saw a ghost.

180
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:42,568
None other than the ghost
of Letitia Gore herself!

181
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:45,571
I was on the third floor
when I...

182
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,006
Ooh, the larping's started.

183
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,909
The... what is that again?

184
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,811
Live-action role-playing.
It's a game.

185
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:53,045
The convention puts it on.

186
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,250
Terror gripping
my heart with its icy...

187
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,519
"Dad's journal...
dear Sam and Dean,

188
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:04,022
"this hotel is haunted.
you must hunt down the ghost.

189
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:05,925
"interview witnesses,
discover clues,

190
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,192
"and find the bones.

191
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:11,564
"first team to do so
wins a $50 gift card to sizzler.

192
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:13,666
Love, dad."

193
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,868
You guys are so gonna win.

194
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:22,040
Why, yes, agents
Lennon and McCartney,

195
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,343
As manager
of this fine establishment,

196
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:28,280
I can assure you
that it is indeed haunted.

197
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:30,816
This building
was once an orphanage

198
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:33,786
Run by mean, old
Letitia Gore.

199
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,856
100 years ago
this very night,

200
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,891
Miss Gore went insane

201
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,159
and butchered
four little boys

202
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:42,728
before killing herself.

203
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:46,765
Now folks say that the souls
of those poor, little boys

204
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
are trapped here

205
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:51,804
and that the evil spirit
of Miss Gore punishes them

206
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:55,440
to this... very... day.

207
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,543
Well, that's just about
all the community theater

208
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,077
I can take.

209
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,079
Yeah, this cannot get
any weirder.

210
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:02,915
dad said...

211
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,483
He said, I may have to kill you.

212
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:05,751
kill me?

213
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:07,553
What the hell
does that mean?

214
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,488
I don't know.

215
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,456
Ohh.

216
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,728
I need a drink.

217
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,933
The EMF's going nuts.

218
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,141
whoo-o-o-o-o!

219
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,877
I'm mean, old Letitia Gore.

220
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:34,312
They buried me
in the basement.

221
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:35,948
Whoo-o-o-o-o.

222
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,518
Ow. you got me.

223
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:42,421
you're supposed to vanish.

224
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,222
how am I supposed to vanish?

225
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,960
Yeah, okay, Dean.
we'll see you in five.

226
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:50,663
Hey, but seriously, dude,
don't eat my skittles.

227
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:52,064
Help us.

228
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,136
Help us. Miss Gore
won't let us have any fun.

229
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:01,740
This is part
of the game, right?

230
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,110
Holy mother of crap!

231
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,790
That... was...

232
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,225
Aah! aah! ugh!

233
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:29,234
Naughty! Naughty! Naughty!

234
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,336
Aah!

235
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:50,564
# signin' autographs,
makin' people laugh #

236
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:56,370
How you doin'?

237
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:57,538
Busy.

238
00:11:57,572 --> 00:12:00,608
Well, you sure look
lovely tonight,

239
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:01,743
Especially for a dead chick.

240
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:03,544
Buddy, I have heard that line

241
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:06,413
17 times tonight, okay?

242
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:09,517
And all from dudes wearing
macGyver jackets.

243
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:15,089
But you seem different.

244
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:16,457
How so?

245
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:17,892
Well, you don't seem
scared of women.

246
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:20,828
for the last time, I'm not
making this up, okay?

247
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,397
She... she's upstairs.
a real, live, dead ghost!

248
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:24,932
Excuse me.

249
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:26,868
Look, I'm sure it was
just one of the actors.

250
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:28,836
Who beat the crap out
of me and then vanished?

251
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:29,971
You saw something?

252
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,605
Look, this isn't
part of the game, jerk.

253
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,508
Tim, I'm getting out of here,
and you should do the same.

254
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:38,378
Alex, wait. I...
Hey come back.

255
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:41,649
What do you think?

256
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:45,452
I don't think that guy's a good
enough actor to be acting.

257
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,755
Why, yes, agents
Jagger and Richards,

258
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,257
As the manager
of this fine establishment,

259
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:53,795
I can assure you
it is indeed haunted.

260
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,797
The building
was once an orphanage

261
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:58,733
Run by mean, old
Letitia Gore.

262
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:01,669
Excuse us. mind if we
ask you a few questions?

263
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:03,838
Look, I don't have time
to play "Star Wars," guys.

264
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:07,809
Go ask the guy
in the Ascot.

265
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:09,543
Actually, we, uh...

266
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:11,312
<i>really want to talk to you.</i>

267
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:13,781
Okay. you guys are really into this.

268
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,482
You have no idea.

269
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:17,284
What do you
want to know?

270
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,686
All this stuff
they're saying...

271
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,121
Place being haunted,
Letitia Gore.

272
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:22,356
Any truth to it?

273
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,391
We generally don't like
to publicize this

274
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:26,160
To, you know, normal people.

275
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:30,464
But, yeah, in 1909, this place
was called, Gore orphanage.

276
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:33,868
Miss Gore killed four boys
with a butcher knife,

277
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:35,336
Then offed herself.

278
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,938
And is tonight
really the anniversary?

279
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:39,040
Yep. guess your convention folks
wanted authenticity.

280
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:41,575
Huh.

281
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,244
There been any sightings?

282
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,645
Uh, over the years, yeah.

283
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,647
A few maids have quit,

284
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:49,483
Saying they heard
the boys or saw them.

285
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:51,052
A janitor even
saw Miss Gore once.

286
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:53,221
Where did Miss Gore
carve up the kids?

287
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:56,657
Look, I don't want you
stomping all over the joint.

288
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:58,492
A lot of this place
is off-limits to nerds.

289
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:07,468
The attic.

290
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:34,528
The EMF's going nuts.

291
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:38,166
Great.

292
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,667
So, we got a real ghost,

293
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:42,103
and a bunch of dudes, pretending
to be us, poking at it.

294
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,538
No way this ends well.

295
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:47,641
You know what?
serves them right.

296
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:49,076
Dean.

297
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:51,879
Well, I'm just saying.

298
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:06,994
It's got to be around
here some place.

299
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:08,762
yeah, I don't know, man.

300
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:10,764
No one else
is looking for the attic.

301
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,834
okay, all right, dude.

302
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,236
One, stay in character,
all right?

303
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,471
If it's just me,
I look stupid.

304
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:20,507
And, two, you heard
the guy downstairs.

305
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:23,510
I think this
is part of the game.

306
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:26,013
Help us.

307
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:29,083
Oh, my god!

308
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:31,252
That make-up is amazing.

309
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,419
Amateur.

310
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:35,089
Stay... in... character.

311
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,658
Sorry. Sorry.

312
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:40,862
Help us. Miss Gore
won't let us have any fun.

313
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,629
where's the body buried, kid?

314
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:45,432
We'll light her up
nice and toasty.

315
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:46,767
Yeah.

316
00:15:56,778 --> 00:16:00,281
Wow. Fast runner.

317
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:01,983
Dude.

318
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,086
Check this out.

319
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:09,991
Oh, that is creepy.

320
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:12,059
Must've been what
he was trying to tell us.

321
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:14,595
Gee, you think, Sammy?

322
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:30,711
Okay, this is the
coolest game ever.

323
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:35,616
Yes.

324
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:02,876
My mommy loves me.

325
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:08,416
I said my mommy loves me.

326
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:11,618
I'm sure she does.

327
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,988
My mommy loves
me this much.

328
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:45,953
Awesome.

329
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:48,022
All right, so...

330
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:50,858
That was a guy with the county
historical society.

331
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:52,059
And?

332
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:54,061
Not only did Letitia Gore
butcher four boys,

333
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:55,997
but one of them
was her own son.

334
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,764
- Her son?
- Yeah.

335
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,200
According to the police
at the time,

336
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:00,767
She scalped the poor kid.

337
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:03,304
Oh, that's it. I'm gonna
deep-fry this bitch extra-crispy.

338
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:05,839
- Dude say where she was buried?
- He doesn't know.

339
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:07,608
Check it out.

340
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:11,379
There's the orphanage,
here's the carriage house

341
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:13,981
and right there, cemetery.

342
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:16,950
you think that's
where Letitia's planted?

343
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,986
It's worth a shot.

344
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:22,523
Hey., ooh. hey, hey!
hey, do you mind?

345
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:24,125
It's real, a century old, at least.

346
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,060
And he's right. There is
a cemetery on the grounds.

347
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:27,794
Where'd you get that?

348
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:29,930
It's called a game, pal.

349
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:31,665
It ain't called "charity."

350
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:33,267
All right, give me
the map, Chuckles.

351
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,469
Oh, you're the Chuckles...

352
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:36,670
Chuckles.

353
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:40,107
Besides, Dean
don't listen to nobody.

354
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:42,209
Dean... cool it.

355
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:43,911
Dean.

356
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:46,713
What? They're friggin' annoying.

357
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:49,183
Look, guys, we all want
to find the bones, right?

358
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:52,253
We just thought it would go
faster if we all work together.

359
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,824
We, uh, we get
the sizzler gift card.

360
00:18:57,859 --> 00:18:59,126
Fine.

361
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,028
and we get to
be Sam and Dean.

362
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:03,697
Fine.

363
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:06,167
Yes.

364
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:10,471
Hey, Rufus, Bobby,
would you hurry it up?

365
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:11,939
You alright?

366
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:14,875
I'm trying to be.

367
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,077
So, where were we?

368
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:19,146
Uh, Dr. Ellicott
had just zapped your brain.

369
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:21,549
Right. got it.

370
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,884
Why are we even here, Dean?

371
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:25,686
Do you just follow
in dad's footsteps

372
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,521
Like a good, little soldier?

373
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:29,323
Are you that desperate
for approval?

374
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:30,657
this isn't you talking, Sam.

375
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,659
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

376
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:34,895
I got a mind of my own.
I'm not pathetic.

377
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,565
So, what are you gonna do, Sam?
you gonna kill me?

378
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,967
Man, I am so sick of you
telling me what to do!

379
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:42,169
Oh, you know what?
that... that's it.

380
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:43,404
That is it.

381
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:45,172
what's wrong, Bobby?

382
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:49,143
I'm not Bobby, okay?

383
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:50,711
You're not Sam.

384
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:52,113
You're not Dean!

385
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,514
What is wrong with you?

386
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:56,750
Why in the hell would you
choose to be these guys?

387
00:19:56,784 --> 00:19:59,553
Because we're fans, like you.

388
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:00,687
No.

389
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:03,790
I am not a fan, okay?
Not fans.

390
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:07,961
In fact, I think that the
"Dean and Sam" story sucks!

391
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:11,499
It is not fun,
it's not entertaining.

392
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,234
It is a river of crap

393
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:16,069
that would send most people
howling to the nut house!

394
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:17,404
So, you listen to me.

395
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,406
Their pain is not
for your amusement.

396
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:20,974
I mean, do you think
that they enjoy

397
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,245
Being treated like...
like circus freaks?

398
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,247
Uh, I don't think they care,

399
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,617
Because they're
fictional characters.

400
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:31,785
Oh, they care.

401
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,187
Believe me

402
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:34,421
they care a lot.

403
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,127
He, uh...

404
00:20:41,763 --> 00:20:44,265
He takes the story
really seriously.

405
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:12,826
Found the four boys.
and here's Letitia Gore.

406
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,266
Uh, what are
you guys doing?

407
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:25,138
Uh, we're looking
for bones, genius.

408
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:27,808
They got to be around
here somewhere.

409
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:31,178
Okay, generally,
bones... are in the ground.

410
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:32,513
Yeah.

411
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:34,715
I know that.
I'm just...

412
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:37,784
Wait, hold on.

413
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:41,422
- Are you guys serious?
- Deadly.

414
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:44,391
We're... we're not really
digging up graves, you guys.

415
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:46,227
We're just playing
the game, so...

416
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:47,361
Trust us.

417
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:48,895
You want to win the game, right?

418
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:29,870
Ohh!

419
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,141
That's, uh, not a plastic skeleton.

420
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:35,909
That's a skeleton, skeleton.

421
00:22:35,943 --> 00:22:37,578
You just dug up
a real grave.

422
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:38,779
Yeah.

423
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:45,152
You guys are nuts.

424
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:46,920
I thought you said you guys
wanted to be hunters.

425
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:48,722
Hunters aren't real, man.

426
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,658
- This isn't real.
- Oh, my god.

427
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,226
You guys have just seriously
lost your grip on this...

428
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:56,897
What?

429
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:59,065
Naughty! Naughty! Naughty!

430
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:04,405
Barnes!

431
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:10,511
Oh, my god!

432
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:12,746
Naughty! Naughty! Naughty!

433
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,490
Aah!

434
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:34,435
Real enough for you?

435
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:49,473
# well, she ought to
come on home #

436
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:55,313
That was...

437
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:56,613
Really...

438
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:58,950
Awful, right? Exactly.

439
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,956
Round's on us, guys.

440
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,157
See you around.

441
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:11,662
Hey, how did you know
how to do all that?

442
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:14,297
We, um...

443
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,268
We read the books.

444
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:25,308
Hey, Chuck.

445
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:27,911
Good luck with
the "Supernatural" books.

446
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,081
And screw you very much.

447
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,452
Fans of yours?

448
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:37,688
Hmm. I'd say no.

449
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,830
That's weird.

450
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:49,433
Definitely.

451
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:53,204
Anything?

452
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:54,938
Every exit's locked.
almost like...

453
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,208
- some thing's keeping us in?
- Yeah.

454
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:58,542
This is bad.

455
00:24:58,576 --> 00:24:59,743
Gee, you think, Sammy?

456
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:04,948
Don't go in there!

457
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:08,052
Get downstairs, okay?
go. go!

458
00:25:10,588 --> 00:25:12,723
Why'd you do that?

459
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,658
Why did you send
my mommy away?

460
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:17,495
Uh, maybe because of the
high-and-tight she gave you.

461
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,663
Yeah?
how 'bout some thanks?

462
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:21,532
well, I'm just saying,

463
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:24,235
A little gratitude might
be nice once in a while.

464
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,237
My mommy
didn't do this to me.

465
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:29,673
What? Then, who did?

466
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:44,355
Yeah. How original.

467
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:47,691
"Supernatural" bringing you
more creepy children.

468
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:48,926
Sigh.

469
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,295
Miss Gore wouldn't
let us have any fun.

470
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:54,031
You look nothing
like real ghosts.

471
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,933
Just telling you.

472
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,168
But Miss Gore's gone,

473
00:25:57,202 --> 00:26:00,671
And now we can have
all kinds of fun.

474
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:09,046
<i>gott im himmel!</i>

475
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:24,628
Well, guys, I guess
we're... we're out of time.

476
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:29,933
So thank you for your incredibly
probing and rigorous questions,

477
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,268
And have a good...

478
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:32,570
Hey.

479
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:34,972
What?! Holy crap!

480
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:38,909
You got to keep everyone
safe in here, Chuck.

481
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:40,077
This is life-or-death.

482
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:42,246
- For how long?
- As long as it takes.

483
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,081
Well, how the hell
am I supposed to do that?

484
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:48,385
I don't know, man.

485
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,620
Just do it.

486
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:57,128
Okay, so, uh...

487
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:58,329
Good news.

488
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:01,832
Uh, I got much more
to tell you... I guess.

489
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,100
Awesome.

490
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:06,837
- Buddy, I got work to do.
- You're gonna want to see this. Trust me.

491
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:09,240
It's gonna be
a hell of a show, huh?

492
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:12,376
Here we go.
here we go.

493
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,280
certainly, there are
a lot of nice witches, too.

494
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:21,852
Uh, what does the future hold
for Sam and Dean?

495
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:25,156
Well, uh, how do you feel
about angels?

496
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,124
Yeah, you know,
because, let me tell you,

497
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,026
They're not nearly as lame
as you think.

498
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:31,629
Okay, new theory.

499
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:34,398
The legends about Letitia
are ass-backwards, obviously.

500
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:37,234
Yeah, so, all right,
let's say those three orphans

501
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:39,736
Were... were playing
Cowboys and Indians.

502
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:41,205
Larping as Cowboys and Indians.

503
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:44,575
Whatever... and let's say
they scalped Letitia's son

504
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:45,876
and killed him.

505
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,045
Mom catches them
in the act, flips out,

506
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,413
Slices them,
and dices herself.

507
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:50,681
If that's true, it means

508
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:52,583
We got three bloodthirsty
brats in the building.

509
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:54,685
Yeah, and Letitia was the only
one keeping them under control.

510
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,487
Until we took her out.
smooth move on our part.

511
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:58,422
All right, well, we got to
get back to the cemetery

512
00:27:58,456 --> 00:27:59,756
And torch the kids' bones.

513
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,925
How? We're trapped.

514
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,860
We don't even have our guns.

515
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:05,162
The ghosts
are running this joint,

516
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:07,331
And they were only scared
of one thing.

517
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,234
Exactly.

518
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:11,735
You want me to do what?

519
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:14,037
You're an actress, okay?
we just want you to act.

520
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:16,507
I work at Hooters in, Toledo.

521
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:18,676
You can forget it.

522
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,211
You'll be safe. We promise.

523
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:22,379
But this is really important.

524
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:24,615
We want to help.

525
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,750
Just give her the
puppy-dog thing, okay?

526
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:28,085
Guys, no.

527
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,286
Why not?

528
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:30,854
Because this isn't
make-believe.

529
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:32,590
Look, we know.
We're not nuts.

530
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:34,525
We're freakin' terrified.

531
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,561
Yeah, but if all these people
are seriously in trouble,

532
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:38,929
We got to
do something.

533
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:40,130
Why?

534
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:41,398
Because...

535
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,200
That's what Sam and Dean
would do.

536
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:48,706
Uh, no, there's really
no such thing

537
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,175
As a Croatoan virus
for you know, down there.

538
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,877
Um...

539
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,346
You really should see a doctor.

540
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,624
Uh...

541
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:09,326
I-I don't want to do this.

542
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:13,797
I'm right here, sweetheart.
I got your back.

543
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:16,800
Trust me.
this is gonna work.

544
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:21,405
Boys!

545
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:24,408
Boys!

546
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:27,411
Come here, this instant!

547
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:42,125
You come when I call you!

548
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,563
Do you understand me?!

549
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,198
Miss Gore?

550
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:54,938
Push.

551
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,513
You boys...

552
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:06,317
Have been very naughty.

553
00:30:07,885 --> 00:30:10,287
Now, you open the doors.

554
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:12,022
Open the doors right now!

555
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:18,429
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

556
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,966
Go!

557
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,036
You're very naughty.
You hear me?

558
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:30,040
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

559
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:37,848
Ugh! damn it!

560
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,411
Run.

561
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:26,195
Oh, my god.

562
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,265
"Supernatural"
makes digging graves...

563
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,901
Seem so easy.

564
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:35,238
It's not, though.

565
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,640
I'm gonna throw up.

566
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:39,576
No, you're not.

567
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:01,932
Thanks.

568
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:04,901
Sam!

569
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:08,438
Let's see, uh, what else?

570
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:13,510
I fell in love
for the first time at 16.

571
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:15,712
Lost my virginity, actually.

572
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:19,483
But then she went around telling
everybody it didn't count, so...

573
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:22,719
That's kind of funny.

574
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:24,988
Uh... excuse me!

575
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:26,723
Y-you really can't leave.

576
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:27,958
Please, sir.

577
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:31,027
Don't open that door!

578
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,290
I said no one leaves, damn it!

579
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:02,792
Now, somebody salt this door!

580
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:20,109
How come Dean
can always light

581
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:22,879
This stupid thing
on the first freakin' try?!

582
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:25,314
Come on!

583
00:33:30,154 --> 00:33:31,755
Dean!

584
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:11,858
You know, maybe
that guy was right.

585
00:34:12,392 --> 00:34:14,109
maybe we should put
these things on a bungee.

586
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:30,083
And I got to
hand it to you, guys.

587
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:34,018
You really saved
our asses back there.

588
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:35,920
So, uh, you know...

589
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:37,289
Thanks.

590
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:40,925
Gosh, I don't
even know your names.

591
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,594
Oh. well, I'm Barnes.

592
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:43,995
This is Damian.

593
00:34:44,029 --> 00:34:45,196
What's yours?

594
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,370
Dean. The real Dean.

595
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:00,011
Yeah, right!

596
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:02,013
- Me too!
- Get the hell out of here, Dean.

597
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:07,519
Well, anyway,
uh, thanks.

598
00:35:07,553 --> 00:35:08,720
Really.

599
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:13,558
You're wrong, you know.

600
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,094
Sorry?

601
00:35:16,128 --> 00:35:17,396
About "Supernatural."

602
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,230
No offense,

603
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:21,900
But I'm not sure you get
what the story's about.

604
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:25,103
Is that so?

605
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:27,539
All right, look,
in real life,

606
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:30,609
He sells stereo equipment,

607
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:32,577
I fix copiers.

608
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:35,714
Our lives suck.

609
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:40,786
But to be Sam and Dean...

610
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,723
To wake up every morning
and save the world...

611
00:35:44,757 --> 00:35:48,794
To have a brother
who would die for you...

612
00:35:48,828 --> 00:35:51,730
well, who wouldn't want that?

613
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:56,468
Maybe you got a point.

614
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:04,075
Well, you know, you two don't
make a bad team yourselves.

615
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:06,478
How do you know each other,
anyway?

616
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:09,481
Oh, uh, well,
we met on-line.

617
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:12,083
"Supernatural" chat room.

618
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:14,353
Oh.

619
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:16,488
Well, it must be nice to get
out of your parents' basement

620
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:17,956
And make some friends.

621
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,291
We're more than friends.

622
00:36:21,561 --> 00:36:23,462
We're partners.

623
00:36:26,366 --> 00:36:27,932
Oh.

624
00:36:31,203 --> 00:36:34,239
Well...

625
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:35,841
Howdy, partners.

626
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,041
Howdy.

627
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:43,548
Look, Sam...

628
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,216
I'm not gonna lie.

629
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:48,987
We had undeniable chemistry.

630
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:53,057
But like a monkey on the sun,
it was too hot to live.

631
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,195
It can't go on.

632
00:36:57,229 --> 00:37:00,599
Chuck and I...
we found each other.

633
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:03,368
My Yin to his proud Yang.

634
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:08,573
And, well, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

635
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:11,710
I am so, so sorry.

636
00:37:13,078 --> 00:37:14,946
Yeah, Sam.

637
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,081
You know, sorry.

638
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:20,652
Will you be all right?

639
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,494
Honestly, I don't know.

640
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:32,731
I'll just have to...

641
00:37:32,765 --> 00:37:36,200
To find a way to
keep living, I guess.

642
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:37,869
God bless you.

643
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:42,273
Okay, um, oh, hey, Chuck,

644
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:44,609
Look, if you really want
to publish more books,

645
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:46,645
I guess that's
okay with us.

646
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,780
Wow. Really?

647
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:50,449
No, not really. we have guns,
and we'll find you.

648
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:52,116
Okay, okay.

649
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:54,285
No more books.

650
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,554
See you around.

651
00:37:57,156 --> 00:37:59,257
Sam! wait!
one more thing!

652
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,662
In chapter 33 of "Supernatural",
time is on my side,"

653
00:38:03,696 --> 00:38:05,063
There was that girl Bela.

654
00:38:05,097 --> 00:38:06,498
She was British
and a cat burglar.

655
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:07,566
Yeah, I know.

656
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,834
She stole the Colt
from you,

657
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:10,569
And then she "said"
she gave it to Lilith, remember?

658
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:11,770
Yeah.

659
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:12,904
Well, you know
she lied, right?

660
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:14,238
She never really
gave it to Lilith.

661
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:16,007
Wait, what?

662
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,175
Didn't you read the book?

663
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:19,010
There was this one scene

664
00:38:19,044 --> 00:38:21,746
Where Bela gives the colt
to a demon named Crowley,

665
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,081
Lilith's right-hand man...

666
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:24,449
I think her lover, too.

667
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:25,784
Crowley?

668
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:27,786
Didn't occur to you
to tell us this before?

669
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,253
I'm sorry.
I didn't remember.

670
00:38:29,288 --> 00:38:31,055
I'm not as big
of a fan as she is.

671
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:33,424
Becky...

672
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:34,626
Tell me everything.

673
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:49,207
You okay?

674
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:50,709
Yeah, you know.

675
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:51,910
I think I'm good.

676
00:38:51,944 --> 00:38:53,678
Well, you're not
gonna believe it,

677
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:55,013
But I got a lead
on the Colt.

678
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:56,180
What?

679
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:57,816
Long story.
tell you on the way?

680
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,084
What are we waiting for?

681
00:39:11,397 --> 00:39:13,064
Like a lot of authors,

682
00:39:13,098 --> 00:39:15,400
I started writing
because of love.

683
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:18,737
Yeah, I had a huge crush
on Nancy Mckeon,

684
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:20,972
Who played Jo
on "The facts of life."

685
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:24,042
I must have written her
like 40 to 50 letters.

686
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:25,476
She never wrote back.

687
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:27,746
I don't think the benders
made flesh suits

688
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,015
out of all their victims, so...

689
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:32,050
Maybe just like
a couple scarves.

690
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:34,986
Actually, my favorite movie
was "Beaches."

691
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:37,155
Hillary and C.C. were just...

692
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:38,557
So brave.

693
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:41,426
So strong.

694
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,594
The way I look at it,

695
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:44,029
It's really
not jumping the shark

696
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:46,397
If you never come back down,
you know?
