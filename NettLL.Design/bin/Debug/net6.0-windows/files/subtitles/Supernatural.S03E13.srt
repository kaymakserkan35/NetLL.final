00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,960
So, you're offering
up your own soul?

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,530
All you got to do
is bring sam back.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,930
How long did they
give you? one year.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,960

We're just trying to get a

Get that damn thing out
of my face. go, go, go, go!

Run!

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,900
Forget it. I'm not going
back in there again.

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,020
Harry, this is our
ticket to the big time --

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,250
Fame, money, sex...

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,360
With girls.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,640
Hello.

20
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,700
I am Harry Spangler.

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,580
And I am Ed Zeddmore.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,160
Now, if you've received this tape,

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,480
You must be some sort of
bigwig network executive.

24
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,550
Well, today is your
lucky day, mister.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,430
Because the unsolicited
pilot you are about to watch

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,140
Is the bold, new
future of "reality tv."

27
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,290
We know you've had it hard

28
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,640
During the crippling
writers' strike.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,150
Lazy fat cats.

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,710
Who needs writers when
you got guys like us?

31
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,690
Our team faced horrible horrors

32
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,660
To bring you the footage that
will change your world forever,

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,410
So strap in for the scariest hour

34
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,180
In the history of television.

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,730
In the history of your life.

36
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,220
Strap in for...

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,460
"Ghostfacers."

38
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,960
You know, it can get kind of hard

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,230
Balancing our daytime careers
with our nighttime missions.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,760
Yeah, but Ed and I
pretty much call the shots

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,970
At the kinko's where we work,

42
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,330
So we can usually pretty much
get off by 6:00 every night?

43
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,950
Yeah, 6:00.

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,010
It's used to be just, you know,
you and I taking on the cases --

45
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,570
Just Harry and me.

46
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,500
Two lone wolves.

47
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,290
And two lone wolves need, uh...

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,930
Other wolves.

49
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,000
Morning, 'facers.

50
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,860
Good morning, Ghostfacers.

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,570
It's 7:00 p.m., dude.

52
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,110
It's morning to a Ghostfacer.

53
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,110
Corbett, what do we got, buddy?

54
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,380
Oh, I'm just putting
up some of the --

55
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,410
Yeah, this has got to go up here.

56
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,530
That's got to go here.
got to see the whole field.

57
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,110
Markers, eraser
-- good job.

58
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,020
I first saw Ed

59
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,990
Putting up flyers
down at the --

60
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,690
The outlet mall in scogan,

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,220
So i-i read one,

62
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,720
And I thought to myself, "huh.

63
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,380
Where do ghosts come from?"

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
And now here I am.

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,770
Ed, your sister's abusing staff.

66
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,850
That's adopted sister,
thank you very much.

67
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,890
Ed has been obsessEd with the
supernatural since we were kids,

68
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,330
You know, and then he meets
Harry at computer camp,

69
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,810
And love at first geek.

70
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,930
Spruce here.

71
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,350
What up, player?

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,170
I am 15/16 jew, 1/16 cherokee.

73
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,340
My grandfather is a mohel,

74
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,010
My great-grandfather
was a tallis maker,

75
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,860
And my great-great-grandfather
was a degenerate gambler

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,400
And had a peyote addiction.

77
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,810
Okay, people. let's cut the
chatter and get on a mission.

78
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,210
Okay?

79
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,330
Morton house...

80
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,260
...one of our big fish.

81
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,480
All right, we all know the legend.

82
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,630
Every four years, supposedly,

83
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,710
This becomes the most
haunted place in america.

84
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,330
The leap year ghost, some call it.

85
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,830
The ghost returns at midnight
just as february 29th begins.

86
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,770
And no one has ever
stayed the night, right?

87
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,570
Yeah, well, every
testimony that we dug up,

88
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,340
Every eyewitness has cut
and run well before midnight.

89
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,450
Well, that's all
about to change, baby.

90
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,420
Absolutely true, Ed.

91
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,820
Absolutely true.

92
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,900
Mmm. that's good.

93
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,550
It's french vanilla,
cause the other day,

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,620
You said how much
you liked it, so...

95
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,160
Thank you.

96
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,010
You are welcome.

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,180
I like Corbett. I do.

98
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,690
Shows up early, does his
job, lot of good hustle out --

99
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,290
I think he's got the hots for Ed,

100
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,600
And that could spell
trouble for the whole team.

101
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,040
Ed's kind of the more ruggEd,

102
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,050
With that really golden...

103
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,500
Beautiful sort of beard.

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,790
Definitely nice.

105
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,050
Uh, and Harry's nice.

106
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,550
29th is this friday, facers.

107
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,000
We want this mission,

108
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,010
We got to move on it
now, or guess what --

109
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,630
He's gone for another four years.

110
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,810
Oh, watch out!

111
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,780
Who is that?

112
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,050
Dad! told you we were gonna
have the garage right now.

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,230
Just cut the cameras.
we don't need that.

114
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,440
We don't need this
part. we don't --

115
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,070
Stay low. follow formation.

116
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,220
Okay, as suspected.

117
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,510
A lot of people have tried to
break into the Morton house.

118
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,560
The local authorities
have just gotten fed up.

119
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,100
Looks like the cops
have got this place

120
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,420
Pretty well fenced off.

121
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,750
Wait.

122
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,920
Didn't you guys get, like,
a permit or something?

123
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,490
A permit? that's a
good idea for next time.

124
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,540
Yeah.

125
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,300
Car!

126
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,590
Car. shh, shh!

127
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,630
Flashlights off.

128
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,710
It's okay. not
cops -- just hicks.

129
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,880
Oh, right on.

130
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,570
Guys, let's go! let's go! let's go!

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,660
Go! go!

132
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,780
Hear that, people?
let's keep it quiet.

133
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,320
There's the kitchen sink.

134
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,330
Copy that. copy that.

135
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,260
All right, everybody.

136
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,160
Ghostfacers, let's line up.

137
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,420
Everybody.

138
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,300
We'll set up camp right here.
this is command center one.

139
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,890
We'll call this the eagle's nest.

140
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,810
Hallway cam one up and running.

141
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,110
Looking good, Corbett.

142
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,480
Copy that, Ed.

143
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,160
Uh...uh, you're welcome.

144
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,970
All right, Spruce, how
are we doing there, buddy?

145
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,410
Checking basement

146
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,180
Maggie, I got no
visual on you, Maggie.

147
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,330
This is Maggie. do you
copy? there you are. hello.

148
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,340
Harry, are you alive?
upstairs, Ed. camera one.

149
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,270
Looking good. I can
smell syndication.

150
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,060
All right, fellas. let's
regroup at the eagle nest.

151
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,530
All right, Spangler.

152
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,920
Battery check,
battery check. check.

153
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,900
Okay.

154
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,800
Check. check.

155
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,980
Yo, robocop.

156
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,360
R-robocop?

157
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,110
You think I -- you think
I look like robocop?

158
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,600
Everybody, bring
it in. bring it in.

159
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,230
We've all been here before.

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,260
Team one, west. team two, east.

161
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,530
Spin the tires, light the fires.

162
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,590
Ghostfacers on three.

163
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,470
1, 2, 3...

164
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,410
Ghostfacers!

165
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,420
Hello!

166
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,750
I'm speaking to the restless
spirits of the Morton house!

167
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,480
Okay.

168
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,940
Hello!

169
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,480
My name's Ed.

170
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,630
Careful.

171
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,530
Watch my back.

172
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,880
Okay. okay.

173
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,060
What's your name?

174
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,490
.3, .29.

175
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,690
Is there an entity or
entities here with us now?

176
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,270
Can you give us a
sign of your presence?

177
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,810
You got to breathe,
buddy. I can't breathe.

178
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,030
Corbett, night vision.

179
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,700
Okay. okay. yeah.

180
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,680
Calm down, buddy.
breathe, all right?

181
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,270
Calm the whirlwinds of your mind.

182
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,530
We're doing a basic emf,
evp, temp-flux sweep.

183
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,680
Looks like we've got all
of our ducks in a row here.

184
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,010
What?

185
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,210
I don't know. it's weird.

186
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,390
It's gone.

187
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,290
All right. get this. get this.

188
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,470
Turn the knob.

189
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,040
All right...

190
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,820
Oh, my god! oh, my god!

191
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,320
Oh, my god! oh, my god!

192
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,810
Oh, my god! oh, my god!

193
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,010
I don't really like rats.

194
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,130
They're gross.

195
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,880
Rats are like the
rats of the world.

196
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,450
What -- was that
an apparition?

197
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,030
Was that a spectral
-- was that a .4?

198
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,130
What do we got, 'cause
the emp was just off the --

199
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,620
Oh, god!

200
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,620
Oh, that is so not funny, Spruce!

201
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,120
Oh, god. okay, it was just...

202
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,620
I think it was just this branch...

203
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,320
Okay...in the window.

204
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,890
This is spooky, man.

205
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,610
This place...

206
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,760
Okay.

207
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,860
Oh, no!

208
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,810
Freeze! police
officers! don't move!

209
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,610
All right. all right. all right.

210
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,580
Let's see some identification.

211
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,960
Come on. let's see some i.d.

212
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,170
What -- are we under
-- under arrest?

213
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,720
We are unarmed.

214
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,780
Oh, god. oh, god.

215
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,900
Want to explain that
weirdo outfit, mr. Corbett?

216
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,280
I know you.

217
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,020
Yeah, sure you do. give
me some identification.

218
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,060
Yeah, ho-- whoa,
hold on a second.

219
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,540
I know the both of you guys. yeah.

220
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,430
What? yeah. huh.

221
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,990
Holy

222
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,010
What?

223
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,680
Uh, west
texas --

224
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,920
The -- the -- the tulpa
we had to take out,

225
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,880
Those two goofballs that
almost got us killed...

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,110
The hellhounds or something?

227
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:29,870
Me.

228
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,310
Yeah, we're not
hellhounds anymore, okay?

229
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,780
It didn't test that
well. Ed, what's going on?

230
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,480
They're not cops,
buddy -- no, not at all.

231
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,410
Ed, Ed, you had a
partner, too, didn't you --

232
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,080
A different guy?

233
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,450
Oh, yeah, yeah. is he
around here somewhere?

234
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,990
He's running around,
chasing ghosts.

235
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,880
Okay, well, listen, you and rambo

236
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,300
Need to get your girlfriends
and get out of here.

237
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,130
All right.

238
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,720
Listen here, chisel chest, okay?

239
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,490
We were here first. we've
already set up base camp.

240
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,980
We beat you.

241
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,410
They were here first.

242
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,100
Oh, god.

243
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,750
Ed... yeah?

244
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,940
...where's your partner?

245
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,460
10.6. 10.7, guys.

246
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
The emf is really spiking here.

247
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,370
Pressure's down, like, 11 degrees.

248
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,550
All right, all right,
keep your eyes peeled.

249
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,720
This could be it.

250
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,610
Maggie, can I get a
reading in here, please?

251
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,540
Something keeps
messing with the chip.

252
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
I don't know what's going on here.

253
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,930
Guys. guys. guys.

254
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,600
I'm sorry. that's it.

255
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,630
I'm telling you, that's
all the money I --

256
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,340
On leap year -- what
are you thinking?

257
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,060
We're here to spend the night,
okay? it's for our tv show.

258
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,300
What? great. perfect.

259
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,080
Yeah, nobody's ever
spent the night before.

260
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,450
Uh, actually, yeah, they have.

261
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,660
Uh, we've never heard of them.

262
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,900
Yeah, you know why?

263
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,480
Cause the ones that have
haven't lived to talk about it!

264
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,620
Oh, come on, I don't believe you.

265
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,380
Look --
missing-persons reports

266
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,810
Going back almost a half century.

267
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,170
John graham stayed
on a dare -- gone.

268
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,510
Julie wilkerson -- gone.
there are tons more.

269
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,860
All of them came to just
stay the night through,

270
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,900
Always on a leap year.

271
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,420
The only body they ever found

272
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,260
Was the last owner,
Freeman Daggett.

273
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,000
These look legit. they are legit.

274
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,800
Look, Ed, we ain't got
much time here, buddy.

275
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,180
Starting at midnight, your
friends are going to die.

276
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,790
Oh, my god! oh, my god!

277
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god!

278
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,090
Guys! guys! oh, my god!
oh, my god! we got one!

279
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,780
Corbett! Corbett, we
saw one! we saw one!

280
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,410
It was a full apparition!
it was like a class four.

281
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,990
It was a spectral
illumination! it...

282
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,640
Hey, aren't those the  from texas?

283
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,700
Yes.

284
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,250
All right, let's have this
reunion across the street, guys.

285
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,130
Crap. what are you guys
doing here? come on, come on.

286
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,480
We'll get you ice
cream -- our treat.

287
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,560
What do you say? let's go.

288
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,180
Yeah, I say no. look at
this. look, look. Ed, Ed.

289
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,600
No. no. look at this.

290
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,510
Okay, honest-to-god
proof, all right?

291
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,720
Are you kidding me?

292
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,580
Yeah. no, not kidding.

293
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,790
What kind of reading did we get?

294
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,310
Uh, it was a 10.9.

295
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,440
10.9?

296
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,310
Yeah, it was 10.9.
it was almost 11.

297
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,180
I came out, and I was
like, "what's going on?"

298
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,810
And I was like --
wait, watch this.

299
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,280
Oh! he got blasted.

300
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,180
It was crazy.

301
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,100
What's a death echo?

302
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,980
We got a problem here.
that ghost ain't it.

303
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,700
Yeah, that's real.
like, that happened.

304
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,030
What's a death echo?

305
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,780
Echoes are trapped in a loop, okay?

306
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,580
They keep replaying how they died

307
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,830
Over and over and over again,

308
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,210
Usually in the place
where they were ganked.

309
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,280
It's about as dangerous
as a scary movie.

310
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,770
Maybe the echo's not dangerous,
but maybe something else is.

311
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,730
You're right. all right, we
need to get out of here, guys.

312
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,080
Come on. let's go.
let's go. let's go.

313
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:42,770
Pack it up.

314
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,320
What about all of our equipment?

315
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,480
Lots of fun. let's go.

316
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,920
We got more material. we
got all kinds of stuff.

317
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,250
We'll make you guys
recurring guest stars.

318
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,240
Wait!

319
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,020
Where's Corbett?

320
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,540
I wish to communicate with
the restless spirits here.

321
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,430
Uh, lights out?

322
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,370
Oh, I think I got
night vision here.

323
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,380
That's better.

324
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,100
No man left behind.

325
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,170
That was Corbett.

326
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:26,890
That was Corbett! Corbett!

327
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,150
Corbett! it's okay!

328
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,010
We'll get him! go back!

329
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,040
Guys!

330
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,980
No! where are you, dude?

331
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,460
Tell us where you are!

332
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,560
Corbett!

333
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,340
Let me go!

334
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,570
Guys!

335
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,950
Corbett, you need to
come back, Corbett.

336
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,950
No!!

337
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,180
Hey! hey! hey! come on.

338
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,610
Corbett's...

339
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,080
He's not here. let's go. let's go.

340
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,240
No. no. no. but that's Corbett.

341
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,210
No, that was Corbett.
didn't you hear that?

342
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,350
Go, go, go, come on.

343
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,300
Guys. guys. guys.

344
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,270
Here we go. here we go. keep
it moving. keep it moving.

345
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,470
Corbett?

346
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,510
Hey. hey. hey.
watch him. watch him.

347
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,760
Go. go. move. move.

348
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,660
Turn it off!

349
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,310
Oh, god, what's happened?

350
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,630
Oh, god. he's gone.

351
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,790
He just disappeared.

352
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,980
Okay, let's just go
through all the angles.

353
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,050
Let's go through all
the cameras we have.

354
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,950
Well, it's 12:04, dean.
you good? you happy?

355
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,750
Yeah, I am happy.

356
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,170
"let's go hunt the
Morton house," you said.

357
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,240
"it's our grand canyon."

358
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,380
Sam, I don't want to hear this.

359
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,120
You got two months left, dean.

360
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,000
Instead, we're gonna die tonight.

361
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,130
Whoa! what the hell is going on?

362
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,310
I'll tell you what's going on.

363
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,070
Every door, every window,

364
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,710
I'm guessing every exit
out of this house --

365
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,980
They're all sealed.

366
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,550
But w-why are they sealed?

367
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,110
It's a supernatural lockdown, okay?

368
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,300
Whatever took Corbett
doesn't want us to leave,

369
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,460
And it's no death echo.

370
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,210
This is a bad mother,
and it wants us scared.

371
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,190
Or it just wants us.

372
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,710
Uh, guys, the camera's
fritzing again.

373
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,400
Whoa. whoa. guys, the
emf's starting to spike.

374
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,190
Everybody, stay close.
there's something coming.

375
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,180
Is this the same echo
you guys saw earlier?

376
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,620
No, it's a different guy.

377
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,000
Multiple echoes? what
the hell's going on?

378
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,100
Beats me.

379
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,100
Okay. all right.
all right. all right.

380
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,980
Uh, hey, buddy!

381
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,490
Hey. hey. wake up. you're dead!

382
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,800
Hello!

383
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,460
What's he doing? what's he doing?

384
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,810
It's rare, but sometimes you
can shock an echo out of its loop

385
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,880
If you can talk to the part of
the ghost that's still human,

386
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,700
But usually you have to have

387
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,830
Some kind of connection
to the deceased.

388
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,630
Come on! wake up! be dead!

389
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,960
You guys hear that?
what's that sound?

390
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,780
You guys hear that?

391
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,430
Snap out of it, buddy, huh?

392
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,320
Come on, what are you waiting for?

393
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,560
You're gonzo! you're dead! hey!

394
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,730
Where the hell did it go?

395
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,310
Dude, there's no records
of any of this here.

396
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,360
No one got shot here.

397
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,160
Obviously, no one got run
over by a freaking train.

398
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:09,990
Stay close.

399
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,930
Did the echoes take Corbett?

400
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,900
Yes. no. I don't know.

401
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,570
We don't know

402
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,020
That's what we're trying
to figure out, okay?

403
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,150
All right, stay close.

404
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,660
Okay, look, death
echoes are ghosts, okay?

405
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,380
Now, ghosts -- they
usually haunt places

406
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,610
Where they lived
or where they died.

407
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,410
Except these mooks
didn't live or die here.

408
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,260
Right.

409
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,250
So, what are they doing here?

410
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,110
Hey, give the lady a cigar.

411
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,160
All right, seriously, does
looking at this nightmare

412
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,480
Through that camera make
you feel better or something?

413
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,420
I mean...

414
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,580
Um...i, uh...

415
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,710
Well, yeah. uh, yeah. I think so.

416
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,960
Freeman daggett,
house's last owner,

417
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,630
Officially commended for
20 years of fine service

418
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,810
At the gamble general hospital.

419
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,570
He's a doctor?

420
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,490
Janitor.

421
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,250
This looks like his den.

422
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,420
When'd you say
he died -- 64?

423
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,530
Yeah, heart attack.

424
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,860
What are these, c-rations?

425
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,860
Yeah, army-issued,
three squares --

426
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,120
Like a lifetime supply.

427
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,280
God, is that all he ate?

428
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,610
One-stop shopping.

429
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,850
Hello. locked.

430
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,180
Oh, come on, guys.
this is ridiculous.

431
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,390
I mean, how the hell is this
supposed to find Corbett, huh?

432
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,910
We should be digging up the
friggin' floorboards right now.

433
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,710
"survival under atomic attack."

434
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,590
An optimist.

435
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,460
Crap. crap.

436
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,280
Taxidermy. okay.

437
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,200
You said Daggett was
a hospital janitor?

438
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah.

439
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,720
Got three toe
tags here --

440
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,800
One, death by gunshots,

441
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,010
Train accident, and suicide.

442
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,140
What?

443
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,600
Well, that explains why all
the death echoes are here.

444
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,550
They're here because
their bodies are here

445
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,110
Somewhere in the house.

446
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,620
Daggett brought the remains
home from the morgue to play.

447
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

448
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,420
Wait a minute.

449
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,570
Corbett.

450
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,420
Okay, Maggie.

451
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,900
Closer to the herd, okay?

452
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,500
Maggie? Maggie?

453
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:14,700
She's fine.

454
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,540
Harry. harry, I got an
8.6 and climbing fast.

455
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,440
Something huge is coming.

456
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,250
Look. something big is coming.

457
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,110
It's past 11, you guys.

458
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,020
What? nobody move!

459
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,830
Hold on. hold on. stay quiet.

460
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,920
It's really cold in here.

461
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,210
Sam?

462
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,770
Some kind of surge.

463
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,080
Sam?

464
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,540
Oh, no.

465
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,270
Sam!

466
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,130
Sammy!

467
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,970
Corbett! sam!

468
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,410
Corbett!

469
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,290
Sam!

470
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,080
God.

471
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:07,810
God, I am so scared.

472
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,290
I'm so scared.

473
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,030
It's gonna be okay. it's
gonna be okay, Maggie.

474
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,950
Corbett!

475
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,760
My best friend...

476
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,840
And my best sister.

477
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,870
Ed. Ed. harry.

478
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,170
Harry. ed. listen, ed.

479
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,820
Are you banging my sister?

480
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,350
No!

481
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,640
No!

482
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,210
Hold my glasses.

483
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,420
Ed.

484
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,900
Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed!

485
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,450
What the are you doing?!

486
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,550
Cut it out!

487
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,860
We're down by two people.

488
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,570
Sam!

489
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,160
Sammy!

490
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,510
Sorry.

491
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm sorry.

492
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:32,800
Give me my glasses.

493
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,340
Did he knock my
-- my tooth there?

494
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,360
Uh, no.

495
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,180
Thanks, Spruce.

496
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,370
Yeah, it's my fault.

497
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,430
That's real great.
that's nice. thanks.

498
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,550
Corbett.

499
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,870
Corbett. hey.

500
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,820
Corbett, hey.

501
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,480
Hey, you got to keep
listening to my voice, okay?

502
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,830
I'm right here. stay awake.

503
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,230
Don't listen.

504
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,640
It stops hurting, so don't worry.

505
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,420
Corbett, stay with me.

506
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,910
Stay with me, you got it?

507
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,300
I'm right here. hey. stay with me.

508
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,070
Don't. don't.

509
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,150
No.

510
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,160
Corbett!

511
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,620
No!

512
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,980
Corbett!

513
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,800
Corbett! where'd you guys go?

514
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,630
Where are you guys?

515
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,810
Dean, what are you doing?

516
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,950
Okay, so Daggett was
a cold war nut, okay?

517
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,610
He was -- he was an
amateur taxidermist.

518
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,220
He liked to slow
dance with cadavers,

519
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,310
And all he ate were c-rations,

520
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,950
So what the hell
are we looking for?!

521
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,820
Horrible little life.

522
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:02,790
Yeah, a lonely life.

523
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,340
A cold war life.

524
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,150
He was scared.

525
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,490
He was scared. he was scared.

526
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,270
Scared of what?

527
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,090
What? dean, where are you going?

528
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Wait, don't leave
me in here, you guys.

529
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,950
Get away from me.

530
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,070
This won't hurt.

531
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,910
It's okay.

532
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,700
It's okay. relax. relax.

533
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,060
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
where are you going?

534
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
Guys like Daggett back then,

535
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,510
the ones who were really
scared of the russkies --

536
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,600
They built bomb shelters.
I'm guessing he's got one.

537
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,750
I'll bet you it's in the basement.

538
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,630
Um, who closed the door?

539
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,200
It did. it wants to separate us.

540
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,630
Ed! listen to me! what?

541
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,070
There's some salt in my duffle.

542
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,800
Make a circle and get inside.

543
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,610
Inside?

544
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,950
Inside your duffle bag?

545
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,450
In the salt, you idiot!

546
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,710
Oh, okay. yeah. yeah.

547
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,160
Harry, hurry up. get in the
circle. get in the circle.

548
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,870
Come on. come on. quick. quick.

549
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,370
Guys, guys, I don't
want to die, okay,

550
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,200
And I don't want you to die.

551
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,520
Harry, listen -- listen
to me, okay? listen.

552
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,690
If we don't die...

553
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,730
...it's totally okay if
you, uh, do my sister.

554
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,270
Ow. nice.

555
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,710
Oh, no, guys. oh. oh, no.

556
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,240
My camera. get in close.

557
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,550
Why does this keep happening?
why does this keep happening?

558
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,900
Why does this keep happening?

559
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,140
Oh, my god.

560
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,390
Oh, god. oh, god.

561
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,920
It's --
it's Corbett.

562
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,100
Oh. oh, c-Corbett.

563
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,400
Hey, can I ask you something?

564
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,620
What?

565
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,020
Earlier, you
and sam --

566
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,190
He said you had two months left?

567
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,420
Yeah, it's complicated.

568
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,360
A while ago, sam...

569
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,850
No. no. no.

570
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,610
I'm not gonna whine
about my  problems

571
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,690
To some reality show.

572
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,280
I'm gonna do my  job.

573
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,690
Is it cancer?

574
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,260
Shut up.

575
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,490
You hear that?

576
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,890
I've been waiting
for some more friends.

577
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,480
I get lonely.

578
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,140
But you're coming to
my party, aren't you?

579
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,540
Is that music?

580
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,900
Yeah, it's coming
from behind this wall.

581
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,240
Wow, you're strong.

582
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,980
You'll stay a good, long time.

583
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,450
Ed. Ed.

584
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,050
Yeah?

585
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,500
Corbett's a --
he's a death echo.

586
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,060
He's reliving his own murder.

587
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,210
Over and over forever.

588
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,020
What's this Daggett
guy's problem anyway?

589
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,830
Loneliness.

590
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,500
He's never heard of a realdoll?

591
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,080
No, no, no, Daggett
was the norman bates,

592
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,840
Stuff-your-mother
kind of lonely.

593
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,440
That's why he lifted these
bodies from the morgue,

594
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,610
Threw himself a birthday party,

595
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,470
Except they were the
only ones who would come.

596
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,080
Anyway, so, at midnight, he
sealed them   in the bomb shelter

597
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,100
And went upstairs and
o.d.'d on horse tranqs.

598
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:21,600
How do you know this?

599
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,180
Cause he told me.

600
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,010
Oh. yeah.

601
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,250
Okay, so now that he's dead, what?

602
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,870
Same song, different verse,

603
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,180
Trying to get people
to come to his party?

604
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,780
Pretty much, yeah. stay forever.

605
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,310
Are those real bullets?

606
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,740
It's rock salt.

607
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,780
Oh, no.

608
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,170
Oh, god.

609
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,490
Wait, guys.

610
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,270
Guys, it's --
it's Corbett.

611
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,540
He's -- he's
-- he's trapped.

612
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,470
He's in a lot of pain, you know?

613
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,900
We got to
try and --

614
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,730
We got to try and pull
him out of his loop.

615
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,540
We have to.

616
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,370
Corbett.

617
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,770
Corbett,
it's --

618
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:25,780
Oh, god.

619
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,080
Don't cross the line of salt.

620
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,280
Corbett, listen to me.

621
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,070
Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.

622
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,570
Listen.

623
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,500
Listen. oh, god. Corbett.

624
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,090
Oh. oh, god. whoa.

625
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,820
Oh, I can't, okay?

626
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,700
He's not hearing me, okay?

627
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,180
He won't stop dying.

628
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,950
Seriously -- you're
still shooting?

629
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,930
It makes him feel
better. don't ask.

630
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,910
Ah, hell, guys.

631
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,970
Get in your ghost-role
thing. something's coming.

632
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,720
Oh,
my --

633
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,880
I know how we can
get through to him.

634
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,960
How?

635
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,120
Ed...

636
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,910
He had feelings for you.

637
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,560
He wanted you.

638
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,940
Wa-- wanted
me to what?

639
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,580
You know.

640
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,330
And you know what you've got to do.

641
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,610
You can do it, Ed.

642
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,860
You've always been the
brave one. yes, you can.

643
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,280
You make us brave
-- Maggie, right?

644
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah.

645
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,390
Ed...

646
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,190
You got to go be gay for
that poor, dead intern.

647
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,250
You got to send him into the light.

648
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,360
Corbett.

649
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,170
Maggie, no. no.

650
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,510
It's okay.

651
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,790
Corbett, look.

652
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,470
Hey, it's just Ed,
buddy. it's just me.

653
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,060
Hey, hey, Corbett, listen
to me. listen to me.

654
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,740
I --
we...

655
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,860
Okay.

656
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,500
You meant...

657
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,220
Corbett, you meant
a lot to the team.

658
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:46,820
You meant...

659
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,300
You meant a lot to me.

660
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,670
You know, never back down...

661
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,550
Never say a bad word, okay?

662
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,910
I remember that, Corbett.
i-i remember that.

663
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,670
I remember because
I love you, Corbett.

664
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,240
I really, truly love you.

665
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,220
Do you remember that? do you?

666
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,590
Hey. Ed?

667
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,500
Yeah.

668
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,340
Yeah, Corbett, it's...

669
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,110
Corbett, yeah, it's me.

670
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,130
It's me. look at me.

671
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,940
You got to help us, man.
you have to help us, Corbett.

672
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,230
Please. please.

673
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,510
Please help us right now.

674
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:36,670
Take it easy. you all right?

675
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,520
Uh, guys...

676
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,830
This is bad
-- very bad.

677
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,270
Corbett?

678
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,610
You all right, dude?

679
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,820
You all right?

680
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,400
God.

681
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,140
Leap year, february
29th, the Morton house.

682
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,590
A tragic
day --

683
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,430
A day of souls bound in torment,

684
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,700
Of lives held in cruel balance.

685
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,990
But the
Ghostfacers --

686
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,400
They did the best that they could.

687
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,430
We lost a beloved friend,

688
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,700
But we gained new allies.

689
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,150
We know
this much --

690
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,460
That every day, including today,

691
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,150
Is a new beginning.

692
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,030
We learned more than we can say

693
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,080
In the brutal feat
of the morton house.

694
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,960
The Ghostfacers were
forced to face something

695
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,420
Far more scary than ghosts.

696
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,380
They were forced
to face themselves.

697
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,920
War changes man.

698
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,350
And Maggie.

699
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,320
War changes man...

700
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:35,730
And one woman.

701
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,080
You know, Corbett, we just...

702
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,600
Oh, gosh, we just like to think

703
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,180
That you're out there
watching over us.

704
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:46,980
As far as we're concerned,

705
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,180
You're not an intern anymore.

706
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,530
You have more than earned
full Ghostfacer status.

707
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,510
Plus, it'd be cool to
have a ghost on the team.

708
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,110
Yeah.

709
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,770
You know, and here we were,

710
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,540
Thinking that, you know,
we were teaching you,

711
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,480
And all this time,

712
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,760
You were teaching us...

713
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,670
About heart,

714
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,220
About dedication, and...

715
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:18,030
About how gay love can pierce
through the veil of death

716
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,040
And save the day.

717
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,390
Thank you, alan j. Corbett.

718
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,780
Go well into that
starry night, young turk.

719
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:31,820
Go well.

720
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,570
Come on, Spruce.

721
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,540
I got to get all
this stuff packed up.

722
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,200
So? pack and talk.

723
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
I don't know what to say.

724
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,000
Say what comes to mind.

725
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,190
This is one of our
confessional moments, Corbett,

726
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,130
So confess.

727
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,860
What do you think was
gonna happen tonight?

728
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,250
What do you think's gonna
happen tonight on this trip?

729
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,680
I think tonight
-- I really do --

730
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,860
I think all our dreams
are gonna come true.

731
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,570
Does that sound stupid?

732
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,520
Kind of does, yeah.

733
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,950
So, guys, what do you think?

734
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,720
You all right?

735
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,400
You know, I kind of
think it was half awesome.

736
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,520
Half awesome -- that's
full-on good, right?

737
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,240
Yeah.

738
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,180
I mean, it's bizarre
how y'all are able to --

739
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,250
To honor Corbett's memory while
grossly exploiting the manner of his

740
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,210
death.

741
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:50,940
Well done.

742
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,380
Yeah, that's a real tight
rope you guys are walking.

743
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,140
Yeah. all right, guys.

744
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,320
No, that's reality, man. yeah.

745
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,060
Corbett gave his life
searching for the truth,

746
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,500
And it is our job over here
to share it with the world.

747
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,710
Right. well, um,
our experience --

748
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,720
You know what you get when
you show the world the truth?

749
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,230
A straightjacket or
a punch in the face --

750
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
Sometimes both. right.

751
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,070
Oh, come on, guys,
don't be 'facer haters

752
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,460
Because we happen to have gotten
the footage of the century.

753
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,510
Oh, yeah.

754
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,120
You got us there. yeah.

755
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,200
Yeah, well, we'll
see you guys around.

756
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,130
Dicks.

757
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,140
Oh, yeah.

758
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,860
Yeah. yep.

759
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,670
Start laying off some dvds.

760
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,610
Sounds like a good idea, Spruce.

761
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,140
You know, guys, I think we're gonna
need a bigger office here, you know,

762
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,100
Cause we're gonna go national,

763
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,530
And then it's gonna go
international, and then --

764
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,570
Hey, menudo left
their dance bag behind.

765
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,980
What's inside, huh?

766
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,170
What the hell is this?

767
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,410
Uh, I seem to be having some
technical difficulty over here.

768
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

769
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

770
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,820
Wait! wait! wait! wait! wait!

771
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,380
"no operating system
found"? wait a minute.

772
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,550
We clean?

773
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,580

No-o-o-o-o-o-o!

774
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,240
Electromagnet wiped out every
tape and hard drive they have.

775
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,190
World just isn't ready
for the Ghostfacers.

776
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,950
That's too bad. I
kind of liked the show.

777
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,990
Had its moments.
