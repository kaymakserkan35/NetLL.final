You broke into
Stacy's therapist's office.

Last you heard, your father?

172
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,978
He threw me out
when I was 16.

173
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,680
It's just as well.

174
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,591
I got tired of getting
BB guns for my birthday
when I'd asked for a Barbie.

175
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,856
Dads can be
real sweethearts.

176
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,659
Sensitive and cute.

177
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,799
He's cute.

178
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,280
He ran into that
heating vent, right there.

179
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,877
Hopefully, Mark's anger
will go away eventually.

180
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,388
He's not angry,
he just doesn't like you.

181
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,855
Nothing unique there.

182
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,655
Didn't seem real wild
about you, either.

183
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,922
He's fine with me.

184
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,993
He's angry.
Said so in group.

185
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,729
Of course he's angry.
He's looking at
months of painful physio.

186
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,537
He's mad at you.

187
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,732
There's no way he said that.

But it's true.

for being able to walk.

Ignore the moaning
and squeaking.

more than cigarettes.

Well, let's assume
it's one of those.

214

dangerous to begin with,

If he's positive...

put you on three
anti-viral medications.

Nelfinavir,
zidovudine, and lamivudine.

There are side effects,
headache, nausea,

in Cameron's eyes and mouth,

The "coughing" part,
not the "in Cameron" part.

ruptured in his lung.

is not gonna
change what happened.

Could be

No edema, no bloody urine.

263
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,580
Well, KS on his face could
mean KS in his lungs, with
bleeding from the lesions.

Wry neck. Is he an athlete?

He's a regular runner.

286
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,208
Any pain
associated with movement?

287

None that
he's complained of.

00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,251
I might have HlV,
a drink's not gonna
wash it away.

There's like zero chance
of you contracting the virus.

He was very reassuring.

00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,999
Kept reminding me
that the hospital covers
all my medical costs.

301
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,399
Apparently forgot to mention
that if I do test positive,

302
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,461
that they'll pass it on
to legal, and legal will
dig up any dirt they can,

304
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,704
I'm a drug user or tramp,
and that's why I have HlV.

305
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,940
It's not like they're gonna
find anything, right?

306
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,241
Right.

00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,907

CHASE:
Kalvin's a photographer.
The broken bulbs were props.

309
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,980
The glass is from
1930s fluorescents.

310

Some of the bulbs
are date-stamped.

of beryllium.

a paper on acute berylliosis.

Phew!

317
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,899
For a moment there,
I thought you were smart.

318
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:52,273
Cameron, get a biopsy
of Kalvin's lung tissue,
run a spectrographic analysis.

319
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,572
I can handle it.

320
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,877
No reason to risk
exposing the entire team.
Then who would I torment?

a sharp pinch.

a piece of your lung.

looking for at my hotel?

We thought maybe
you'd used toxic meth.

329
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,174
We'll know if you were
exposed to beryllium
in a few hours.

330
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,219
Well,
if you're still curious,

331
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,754
it's in my bag over there
on the chair.

332
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,717
You brought drugs
into the hospital?

333
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,591
Glad I wasted my time
at your hotel.

for a sample.

341

My bet is
she mentions me to Mark
as little as possible.

453

00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,643
This is none of
your business.

516
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,310
Well, you should've
thought of that
before you stalked me.

517
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,377
Now I'm interested.
So what's he got
to apologize for?

518
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,683
You're the one
who tossed him out.

519
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,916
Now why would I do that?

520
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,389
I don't know,
because it's tough

521
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,824
to brag to
your hunting buddies

522
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,520
that your son knows
all the words to The Wiz.

523
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,358
That's a lie.
42nd Street?

524
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,422
(LAUGHS) No.
Much easier just to
get drunk and beat him.

525
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,731
Explains his hating you,
and also your cirrhosis.

526
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,062
Also, why the more I talk,
the more you sweat.

527
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,768
What it doesn't explain,
is why he's got to
apologize to you.

528
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,975
Residual guilt for
sharing your special toy
with other boys?

529
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,915
Just leave it alone.

530
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,920
You just wanna leave
the bigot with some peace
of mind after you're gone?

531
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:20,389
Look, this has got nothing,
and I mean nothing,
to do with him being gay.

532
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,085
Now Kal brought this
on himself

533
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,855
with what he did
to his mother.

534
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,657
He steal her signature look?

535
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,719
No.

536
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,793
No, he killed her.

537
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,007
Kalvin lied!

538
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,676
Yeah.
That certainly is shocking.

539
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,404
Mom's kidneys were failing,
she needed a transplant,
they tested Kalvin,

540
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,043
he was a match,
he was also positive for HlV.

541
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,020
Mom never found
a qualified donor, she dies.

542
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,924
HOUSE: Tragic tale.

543
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,225
Undercut slightly
by the rapid-fire delivery
and constant movement.

544
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,957
Too much coffee this morning?

545
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,228
He didn't kill her.
Our bodies aren't
donor farms for our parents.

546
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,464
It's not 1980.
We know how HlV
is transmitted.

547
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,668
If Kalvin got HlV through
unprotected sex, dad has
every right to be pissed.

548
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,471
So you always use a condom?

549
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,636
Yeah.

550
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,611
Brothers on
the down-low got to.

551
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,739
I'm not ready for any
Foreman Juniors yet.

552
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,546
You?
Working girls are sticklers.

553
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,947
You're not gonna poll Chase?

554
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,684
I'm not an idiot.

555
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,382
Obviously not.

556
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,829
Who doesn't sleep with
a drugged-out colleague
when they have a chance?

557
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,227
Where's Wilson?

558
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,897
We got the result
of the Kveim test.

559
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,148
But so...

560
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,314
I have cancer?

561
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,884
In all likelihood, yeah.

562
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,957
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

563
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,653
And I am

564
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,655
dying?

565
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,963
We need to biopsy the tumor.

566
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,005
It's near your aorta,

567
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,871
so getting that sample
carries serious risks.

568
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,841
Is my dad still here?

569
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,139
He hasn't been in?

570
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,649
We'll inject a dye around
your heart to make the tumor
visible on the CT.

571
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:35,792
WlLSON: Then a surgeon
inserts a guide wire,
runs it up into your heart,

572
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,729
where he takes a small piece
of that tumor so we can look
at it under the microscope.

573
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,198
Ativan.

574
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,963
It' ll help
settle you down.

575
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,697
Why are you so calm?

576
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,830
Not coming off meth helps.

577
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,006
Last night probably
shouldn't happen again.

578
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,205
Do you think I want it to?

579
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,750
When two people have had sex,
unless it sucks,

580
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,342
if they can do it again,
they're gonna do it again.

581
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,116
And that's when
things get complicated.

582
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,120
And it didn't suck.

583
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,664
So now you've gotta drum up
another excuse to be around
the love of your life.

584
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,769
Could hit another patient.

585
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,361
Yeah, don't like
to repeat myself.

586
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,906
People will say
I'm formulaic.

587
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,772
Well, that rules out
letting the rat go
so you can catch him again.

588
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:26,935
I can't do that.

589
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,741
Steve needs two weeks'
antibiotics and
a smoke-free environment.

590
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,009
Cigarettes aggravated
his infection.

591
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,849
The rat is actually sick?
That thing could infect
the entire hospital.

592
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,912
Steve's infection is not
contagious to humans.

593
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,424
I'm an idiot.
How do I miss mycoplasmosis?

594
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,720
Was that the kid's father?

595
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,592
Yeah.
Remember the Black Death?
It started with rats.

596
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,062
Well, what's he doing
in the hallway?

597
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,462
Is the kid getting
his biopsy already?

598
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,591
He just won't
go in the room.

599
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,431
Who knows what else he has,
parasites,
bacterial infection?

600
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,370
The kid doesn't
have parasites.
Not the kid, the rat.

601
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,602
Was he still sweating?

602
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,870
Rats only sweat
through their tails.

603
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,775
Not the rat, the dad!

604
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,112
Where are they from?

605
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,978
Montana. What's going on?

606
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,747
You were right,
it's a parasite.

607
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,153
Cancel the biopsy,
it'll kill him.

608
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,622
Hey, Daddy, come with me.

609
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,690
Yeah, I'm not going in there.

610
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,162
(SlGHS)

611
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,063
Your son asked to talk to you.

612
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,929
Why is he here?

613
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,567
He wanted to talk to you.

614
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,570
Did you two
used to hunt together?

615
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,739
Foxes? Did you kill foxes?

616
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,283
It's Montana.

617
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,386
Those masses in your chest
are not tumors.

618
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,856
They're parasitic cysts from
a bug called echinococcus.

619
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,790
Touch a dead fox,
they jump aboard,

620
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,692
they can hunker down
for decades.

621
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,788
Growing, spawning, shopping,
putting on plays.

622
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,164
I've been tested
for parasites.

623
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,798
Okay, it's cancer. You happy?

624
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,003
The cysts isolate
the parasites,

625
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,339
keeping them from showing up
in stool samples. Even in
blood tests, cardiac...

626
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,969
All right,
you don't need me for this.

627
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,981
But you've got
the same things
in your liver.

628
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,310
I have cirrhosis.

629
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,353
Liver cysts have
identical symptoms,
with one addition, fever.

630
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,681
And liver cysts
we can test for.

631
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,454
Your diagnosis
could confirm Kalvin's.

632
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,397
So, option A,
we draw some blood...

633
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,227
No, no, no.
Look, you're not touching me.

634
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,994
Well, you see,
this is why I need you here.

635
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:33,764
I want you to tell your son
that you won't take a simple,
painless blood test

636
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,465
to save his life.

637
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,149
You

638
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,947
never expressed
a shred of regret

639
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,083
for what happened
to your mother.

worn a damn rubber,
you'd have been fine.

You could have
saved her life.

643
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,560
You wouldn't be lying here.

HOUSE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it!

645
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,436
You're really mad at him
for killing himself,

646
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,304
and for destroying
everything you love.

647
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,866
I don't have time for this.
Are you gonna apologize?

648
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,936
I'm living my life
the way I want.

649
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,241
Are you gonna
give me some blood?

then neither do l.

00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,645
Okay, option B.

652
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,654
Why did your wife
kill herself?
Did she hate you?

653
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,690
She was a diabetic!

654
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,850
You know, you don't know
a thing about my Susan.

655
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,623
Either Susan wanted to die,
or she was both
fat and stupid.

instead of a gun.

well, they just can't get
enough of anything.

685
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,063
Can I have next week off?

686
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,170
Two family members assaulted.

687
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,708
It was self-defense.

688
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,040
You baited him.

689
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,308
You're right,
I was asking for it.

690
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,077
The low-cut blouse,
the do-me pumps.

691
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,483
You flooded his gut
with a parasite.
He could sue.

692
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,683
Go see Stacy.

693
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,318
Okay.

694
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,653
That's it, "okay"?

695
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,860
No name-calling? No squawking,
no rending of garments?

696
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,698
I like this t-shirt.

697
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,533
You lied to me.

698
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,237
If this is
about my mom, l...

699
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,907
This is about your lonely,
miserable life.

700
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,779
I'm not miserable.

701
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,682
And as long as
there's a gay bar around,
I'm never lonely.

702
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,982
You haven't had
a single visitor
except for your dad.

703
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,288
Drugs are great,
HlV freed you,

704
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,691
your dad hates you,
you're so happy.

705
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,390
Everything's a lie.

706
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,625
You blame yourself
for your mom's death.

707
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,567
You're not trying
to have fun, you're trying
to self-destruct.

708
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,901
You wanna kill yourself,
fine, but stop recruiting!

709
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,745
Heard you hit
another patient.

710
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,753
Yeah, sure, why not?

711
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,382
He hit me first.

712
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,255
Cuddy didn't mention that.
Let me see.

713
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,787
I'm the doctor.

714
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,958
My concern is purely legal.

715
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,699
Looks okay. Does it hurt?

716
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,700
A little.

717
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,634
You need some ice.

718
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,076
There's no way
that Mark doesn't know.

719
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,747
About the smoking.

720
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,583
He would have said something.

721
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,755
Then he hasn't been
near you in months.

722
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,296
We're fine.

723
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,959
Can't be easy.

724
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,728
Stop squirming.

725
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,971
Why would you
lie about this?

726
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,539
I'm not lying.

727
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,019
I don't care if you're
sleeping with him or not,
but you're not, so...

728
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,180
I am.

729
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,823
You're lying.

730
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,452
You know when I have sex?
You can smell that on me, too?

731
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,960
The only people who know
about what's going on
with me and Mark,

732
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,056
are me and Mark.

733
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,533
Well, I just know you.

734
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,932
And I know you.

735
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,306
You're confident, arrogant,
but you're never certain

736
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,541
unless there's a reason
to be certain.

737
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,913
One other person knew.

738
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,543
I told you I was
seeing Dr. Harper,

739
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,110
you can easily
get into her office.

740
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,815
You read my file.

741
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,994
You read my file.

742
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,633
The dishes, the concern,

743
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,039
the acting like
a human being.

744
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,508
You have...

745
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,080
This whole time,
you've been manipulating me.

746
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,311
You knew that I had
an angle the moment

747
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,648
I poured soap
onto a scrub brush.

748
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,357
You could have thrown me out
or ignored me

749
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,862
or found another exterminator.
You didn't even tell Mark
that I kept coming by.

750
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,093
You let this happen
because you wanna be with me.

751
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,296
I don't anymore.

752
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,302
Get out.

753
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,834
I'm sorry.
