I got a year to live and I'd
like to make the most of it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,400

of bitches and we raise a little hell?

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,600
I know how you feel,Dean.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,700
Dad's dead.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,600
He left a hole and it hurts
so bad that you can't take it.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm ok. I swear to the next person who ask
me if I'm ok,I am start to throw punches.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,000
There's no way to save me
from the pit,isn't it? no

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,500
You are gonna die. And this
is what you are gonna become.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,800
I don't want to go to hell.
we'll find a way to save you.

00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,800

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm just a saleswoman. I
got a boss,like everybody.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,700
who holds the contract.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,100
I can't tell you.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,200

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400

comer. Her name is Lilith.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,200
Lilith?

Lind

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,400
I had to talk to you.

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,200
You can't keep calling here.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,000
Ow,I know.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,200
Just tell me you
thought about it,please.

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,200
There's nothing to think about.

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Don't say that.

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,400
I can't. You know
I can't -- My wife.

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,900
I'm begging you. Come
to me. Come to me,Ben.

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,300
No.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,700
Linda,please. Please,just
leave me alone.

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm not gonna stop. I miss you,Ben.

36

We can be together.
We can be happy.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,100
This is --
This is crazy.

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,400
I love you forever.
Don't you love me?

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,800
You know I do.

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
More than anything.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,900
But...

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,400
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,800
Ben,wait.

44
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,300
Okay,linda.

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,900
You win.

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,500
I'm coming.

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,900
Yep. I got it. Okay,bye.

48
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,700
So?

49
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
So,the professor doesn't know crap.

50
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,200
Shocking. Pack your panties,Sammy.
We're hitting the road.

51
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,400
What? What's up?

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
That was bobby.

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,400
Some banker guy blew
his head off in ohio,

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,500
And he thinks there's
a spirit involved.

55
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,400
So you two were talking a case?

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,700
No,we were actually
talking about our feelings

57
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
And then our favorite boy bands.

58
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,800
Yeah,we were talking a case.

59
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,800
So,a spirit
-- What?

60
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,400
Yeah,well,banker was complaining

61
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,800
About some electrical problems
at his pad for,like,a week --

62
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,800
Phones going haywire,
computers flipping on and off.

63
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,500
Huh?

64
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,400
Uh-Huh.

65
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,700
This is not ringing your bell?

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
<i>Well,sure,yeah,but,Dean,we're
on a case.</i>

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,100
Whose? Yours.

68
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,900
Right,yeah. Could have fooled me.

69
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,300
What the hell else
have we ha doing lately

70
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,800
Other than trying
to break your deal?

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Chasing our tails,that's what.

72
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Sam,we've talked to
every professor,witch,

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Soothsayer,and two-Bit
carny act in the lower 48.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Nobody knows squat.

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,100
And we can't find bela.
We can't find the colt.

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,700
So until we actually
find something,

77
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,300
I'd like to do my job.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
Well,there's one thing we
haven't tried yet. No,Sam. No.

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Dean,we should summon ruby. I'm
not gonna have this fight with you.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
She says she knows how to
save you! Well,she can't!

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,900
Oh,really? You know
that for sure? I do.

82
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,500
How? Because she told me,okay?

83
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,600
What?

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000
She told me...

85
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
flat-Out

86
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,800
that she could not
save me -- Nobody can.

87
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,500
And you just somehow neglected
to mention this to me?

88
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,500
Well,you know,I really don't
care what that bitch thinks,

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,300
And neither should you,so...

90
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
so what -- Now you're
keeping secretfrom me,Dean?

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
You really want to wk about
who's keeping secrets from who?

92
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,700
Now where are you going?

93
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Guess I'm going to ohig

94
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,700
I found him...there.

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,300
Why don't you just tell us
everything you saw,mrs. Waters?

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,300
You mean besides my dead husband?

97
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,800
Well,just everything
else...you saw,please.

98
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,000
There was,uh,blood...everywhere.

99
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,900
The phone was ripped from the wall,

100
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,400
His favorite scotch on the desk.

101
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
What else could yoco
possibly want to know?

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,300
Why was the phone
ripped from the wall?

103
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,300
I don't know.

104
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,600
You mind if I take a look?

105
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,900
I already went over all this
with the other detectives.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,400
We'll be out of your
hair in no time nma'am.

107
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,100
Ma'am,what time did
your husband die?

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Sometime after 11:00.

109
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
What about strange phone cas?

110
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,600
Receive any of
those lately --

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,700
Weird interference,static,
anything like that?

112
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,600
No.

113
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,900
No.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Mrs. Waters,withholding
information from the police

115
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,900
Is a capital off

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,600
In some parts he world,I'm sure.

117
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,600
A couple of weeks
ago,um,there was this...

118
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,700
this what?

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,100
I woke up one morning,
i heard Ben in his study.

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,100
I thought he was
talking to a woman.

121
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,200
What made you think that?

122
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,600
Because he kept calling her linda.

123
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,500
The thing is...

124
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,300
i picked up the other line,

125
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,800
And...nobody was there.

126
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,700
Ben was talking to
nobody. There was nothing?

127
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,600
Just static.

128
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Did you ever speak to
Ben about this phone call?

129
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,400
No. I should have,but,no.

130
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
Did he ever say who linda was?

131
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
What difference does it make?!

132
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,700
There was no one on the other end!

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,100
Linda's a babe...

134
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,400
or was.

135
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,600
Find her?

136
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Yeah,linda bateman.

137
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,100
***

138
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,700
So what happened? Drunk
driver hit Ben walked away.

139
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,500
So,what -- Dead
flame calls to chat?

140
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,100
You would think,but
linda was cremated.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
So why is she still
floating around?

142
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Uh,you got me.

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,900
What about that,uh,caller i.D.?

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Turns out it's a phone number.

145
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,000
It's no phone number ever seen.

146
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,700
Yeah,because it's
about a century old

147
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,400
From back when phones sd cranks.

148
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,300
***

149
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
You got me there,too,

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
But either way,we
should run a trace on it.

151
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Well,how the hell are we gonna trace
a number that's over 100 years old?

152
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,100
We don't get too many
folks from h.Q. Down here.

153
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,500
Yes,well,office mentioned

154
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,400
That there would be a lunch.

155
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,300
Well,I'm sure we can
arrange something.

156
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,700
The man you gentlemen want to
be speaking to is right this --

157
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,900
I know. Sorry.

158
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,700
Got something of a hygiene
issue down here,if you ask me.

159
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,400
Stewie?

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
What did I tell you about
keeping this place clean?

161
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,400
Spam mail. Spam mail.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,300
***

163
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,900
I don't know how all this got here.

164
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,700
...from headquarters.

165
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,300
Oh.

166
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,500
Give these gentlemen
whatever they need.

167
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,800
Thank you. Thanks.

168
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,800
So,can I help you?

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Is that,uh,bustyasianbeauties.Com?

170
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,200
No.

171
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,200
Maybe.

172
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,700
Word to the wise -- Platinum
membership worth every penny.

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,200
Right. Anyway,um,we're
here to trace a number.

174
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,700
Where did you get this?

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,900
Off caller i.D. Oh,no.
That's impossible.

176
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,600
Hasn't been used in
a few years. We know.

177
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,100
"A few years." It's
prehistoric. Trust me.

178
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,300
Nobody's using this number anymore.

179
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,100
Sure. Could you run it anyways?

180
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,000
Sure. Why don't I just
rearrange my whole life first?

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,500
<i>Listen,uh,stewie.</i>

182
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
You got like six kinds

183
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,600
Of employee-Code
violations down here,

184
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,400
Not to mention the sickening porn

185
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
Clogging up your hard drive.

186
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,900
When my partner
says run the number,

187
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,900
I suggest you run the number.

188
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
Holy crap. What?

189
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
I can't tell you where
the number comes from.

190
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
But I can tell you
where it's been going.

191
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:30,800
What do you mean?

192
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,000
10 different houses
in the past two weeks

193
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,500
All got calls from the Same number.

194
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
So,are we,e here?

195
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,200
'Cause I was sort of busy.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,800
Right.

197
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,800
Yeah.

198
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,400
Hello,sir. I'm with
the phone cpany.

199
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,100
Uh,we didn't call
the phone company.

200
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh,no,sir. No,see,we're
calling you.

201
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,300
We've had a lot of complaints from
the neighborhood lately. Compla

202
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes,sir,uh,droppecalls,static,s

203
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,200
Maybe even strange voices
on the other end of thne?

204
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,900
No,we haven't had any of that here.

205
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Nothing? No.

206
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,500
Okay,uh,great. Just
thought we'd check. Thanks.

207
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,200
No problem.

208
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,500
Let's go.

209
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,700
No way you work for
the phone company.

210
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,100
Sure,I do.

211
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Since when does a
phone guy drive a rental

212
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,900
Or wear a cheap suit?

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,600
Yeah? Well,maybe
we're both keg secrets.

214
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,900
D you ask my dad if we heard
strange voices on the phone?

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Why? Did you hear something? No.

216
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,000
My mistake. Thought maybe you did.

217
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,400
Well,I didn't,okay?

218
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,300
Okay. Sorry to bother you.

219
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,800
Because,you know...

220
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,600
if you did,

221
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,300
Then I would have
told you that I've been

222
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,900
Right where you're
standing right now.

223
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,900
Hearing things,

224
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,000
Even seeing things that
couldn't be explained.

225
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,600
Maybe I would have been able
to help out a little bit.

226
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,800
Yways...

227
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,100
wait.

228
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,400
Maybe...

229
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
<i>...maybe I've been
talking on the phone...</i>

230
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:19,900
th
--

231
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
With my mom.

232
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,400
Well,that's not so stra s

233
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,300
She's dead...

234
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
like three years now dead.

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
How often does she call you?

236
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
A few times.

237
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,700
It started a week ago.

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I thought I was,like,crazy
or something.

239
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,100
Well,I can tell you
one thing for sure,

240
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,100
And you're gonna have to
go with me on this,okay?

241
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,000
You're not crazy.

242
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,800
Dude,stiffs are calling
people all over town.

243
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,000
Tell me about it

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I just talked to an enghty years gradmother
Who's having phone sex with her husband...

245
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,800
- who died in korea.
- Ugh.

246
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,400
Completely rocked my understanding
Of the word "necrophilia."

247
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,800
So,what the hell's
going on here,Dean?

248
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,500
Beats me,but we
better find out soon.

249
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,300
This place is turning
into spook central.

250
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,200
Yeah. All right,I'll
call you later.

251
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
Yep.

252
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,600
Yeah,what?

253
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,500
Sam?

254
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Dean.

255
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,300
Dean,is that you?

256
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Dad?

1
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I mean Dad?

2
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,800
You really think it was dad?

3
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,600
I don't know. Maybe.

4
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,700
Well,what did he sound like?

5
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,600
Like oprah. It was dad.

6
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,900
He sounded like dad.
What do you think?

7
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,300
What did he say?

8
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
My name.

9
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,300
That's it?

10
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,900
Yeah,the call dropped out.

11
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Why would not he call
in the first place,Dean?

12
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,400
<i>I don't know,man. Why are ghosts
calling anybody in this town?</i>

13
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
But I mean,other people are
hearing from their loved ones.

14
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Why can't we? It's at
least a possibility,right?

15
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,300
Yeah,I guess.

16
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Okay,so what...

17
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,200
what if it really is dad?

18
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What happens if he calls back?

19
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
What do you mean?

20
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,300
What do I say?

21
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
"Hello"?

22
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,600
"Hello"?

23
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,500
What you come back
with -- "Hello"?

24
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,100
"hello"

25
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,700
Find anything?

26
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,700
After three hours,i
have found no reason

27
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,800
Why anything supernatural
would be going on here.

28
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,900
Wow,you know,you'd think
a stanford education

29
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,600
And a high-School
hookup rate of 0.0

30
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,500
Would produce better
results than that.

31
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
Hilarious.

32
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,900
Sam,you're just looking
in the wrong places,pal.

33
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,900
And what are the right places,Dean?

34
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,600
Motel pamphlet rack.

35
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Milan,ohio -- Birthplace
of thomas edison.

36
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Yeah,right. So what?

37
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,500
Keep reading.

38
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
You're kidding.

39
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,100
And we're walking.

40
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
And here we have
one of the museum's

41
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,300
Most unique and
treasured possessions --

42
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,100
Thomas edison's "spirit phone."

43
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,800
Did you know that mr. Edison,

44
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,100
While being one of america's
most beloved inventors,

45
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,500
Was also a devout "occultist"?

46
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Ooh-Ooh.

47
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,800
What's with the quotey fingers?

48
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,000
He spent years working on this
- his final invention

49
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,500
Which he was
convinced could be used

50
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,600
To "communicate" with the "dead."

51
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,100
Pretty spooky,huh?

52
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,300
<i>And we're walking. We are walking.</i>

53
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,900
And we are not touching
that. And we are walking.

54
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
Anything?

55
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,500
Nothing.

56
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,800
What do you think?

57
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,200
Honestly?

58
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
It kind of looks like an
old pile of junk to me.

59
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,700
It's not even plugged in.

60
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
- Maybe it doesn't work like that.
- Okay.

61
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,300
Maybe it's like a radio tower,

62
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,200
You know,broadcasting
the dead all over town.

63
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Could be.

64
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,300
Well,you know,the caller
i.D.'S 100 years old,right?

65
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
Right around the time
this thing was built.

66
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,600
Yeah,but why would it all
of a sudden ssu working now?

67
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,500
I don't know.

68
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,300
But as long as the moldy are
calling the freshes around here,

69
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,800
It's the best reason we got.

70
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
Yeah,maybe.

71
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,100
So maybe it really is dad.

72
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,300
Dad?

73
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,800
Dean.

74
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,200
Is it really you?

75
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,000
It's me.

76
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,400
How can I be sure?

77
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,100
You can't.

78
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,500
Dean,how could you do it?

79
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,100
Do what?

80
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,800
Sell your soul.

81
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,800
I was looking after
Sammy like you told me to.

82
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,300
<i>I never wanted
this --Never.</i>

83
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
You're my boy. I love you.

84
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,400
I can't watch you go to hell,Dean.

85
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,100
I'm sorry. I don't
know how to stop it

86
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,500
Because if you break
the deal,Sam dies,right?

87
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,800
What?

88
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
- Well,I know a way out...for both of you.
- How?

89
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
The demon who holds
your contract --

90
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,900
He's here...now.

91
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,900
(ok,see you tomorrow)

92
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,100
(Lanie? Is that you?)

93
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
(Mom?)

94
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,100
(I asked you a question last
night. Have you thought about it?)

95
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,600
(I don't know what you want Of
course you do. I want to see you)

96
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,000
(I went to see you.
At the cemetery.)

97
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,500
(That's not what I mean.)

98
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,600
(But I am scared.)

99
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,500
(Don't be scared. I am
right here with you.)

100
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,300
(come to me)

1
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,800
What's up?

2
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,500
Girl lanie
--Her mom's ghost

3
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,700
Spooked her out
pretty bad last night.

4
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,400
- That sucks.
- Yeah,it does.

5
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,400
What are you doing?

6
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,200
I think dad's right.

7
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,200
<i>I think the demon is here.</i>

8
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,900
Check it out.

9
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,700
What is this
--Weather reports?

10
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,000
Omens --
Demonic omens --

11
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Electrical storms everywhere
we've beenFor the past two weeks.

12
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,200
I-I don't remember
any lightning storms.

13
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,100
Well,I don't remember you studying
meteorology as a kid,either.

14
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,700
But I'm telling you -- That
bastard's been tailing me,

15
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,500
Wearing some poor dude's meat.

16
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,200
And it's following you because...?

17
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,300
I guess I'm big game,you know?

18
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,900
My ass is too sweet
to let out of sight.

19
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,600
Okay,sure.

20
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
<i>Don't get too excited,Sammy.
You might pull something.</i>

21
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,700
Dean,look,I want to believe
this,man. I really do.

22
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,200
Then believe it!

23
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
I mean,if we get this
sucker,it's miller time.

24
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,800
Yeah,that's another thing.

25
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,100
Dad rattles off an exorcism
that can kill a demon --

26
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,500
I mean,not just send it
back to hell,but kill it?

27
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,100
I checked it out.

28
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,800
This is heavy-Duty dark ages.

29
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,900
15th century.

30
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,100
Yeah,I checked on it,too,Dean.

31
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,500
And so did bobby.

32
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,500
Okay. and?

33
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,800
Look,it definitely
is an exorcism,okay?

34
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,700
There's just no evidence
that it can kill a demon.

35
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,100
- No evidence it can't.
- Dean,come on.

36
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,800
Hey,as far as I
know,the only one of us

37
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,900
That's actually been
to hell is dad,okay?

38
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,500
Think maybe he picked up a
couple of tricks down there --

39
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,000
- Like which exorcisms work?
- Maybe it does,okay?

40
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,500
- Look,I hope it does,too,but we just got to be sure.
- Why aren't we sure?

41
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,200
Because I don't know what's
going on around here,Dean.

42
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,300
I mean,some guy
blows his brains out,

43
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
A little girl is
scared out of her wits.

44
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,100
Wow,man! A couple of civvies
are freaked out by some ghosts.

45
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,300
News
flash,Sam --

46
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,600
<i>People are supposed to
be freaked out by ghosts!</i>

47
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
Dad tell you where
to find the demon?

48
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm waiting on the call!

49
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,400
I told lanie I'd stop by.

50
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,800
Oh,good,yeah.

51
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,700
No,you go hang out with jailbait.

52
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,500
Just watch out for chris hansen.

53
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,000
Meanwhile,I'll be here,you know,

54
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,300
Getting ready to save my life.

55
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,700
You are unbelievable,you know that?

56
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,300
I mean,for months we've been
trying to break this demon deal.

57
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,200
Now dad's about to give
us the freakin' address,

58
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,600
And you can't accept it?!

59
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,900
The man is dead,and you're
still butting heads with the guy!

60
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,400
<i>- That is not what this is about.
- Then what is it?!</i>

61
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,200
<i>The fact is,we got no
hard proof here,Dean.</i>

62
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
After everything,you're still
just going on blind faith!

63
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,100
Yeah,well,maybe! You know,
maybe that's all I got,okay?!

64
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,300
Please.

65
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Just please don't go anywhere

66
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,700
Until I get back,okay,Dean?

67
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,400
Please.

68
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,900
Have you told your
father about any of this?

69
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,400
And bother him at work? No.

70
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,400
He wouldn't believe me anyway.

71
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,700
He'd just chuck me into therapy.

72
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,800
So what did your mother say?

73
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,200
That she wanted to see me.

74
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,900
So,at first,I thought I was
supposed to go to the cemetery.

75
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,400
- Did you?
- Nothing happened.

76
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,900
<i>But then she started asking
me to do other things.</i>

77
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,100
What sort of things?

78
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,000
Bad things.

79
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,900
Hello? Simon greenfield speaking.

80
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,400
Hi,mommy.

81
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,100
- Yeah,I want to see you.
- Where are you?

82
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,700
Dad?

83
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,500
Dean.

84
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,900
Where's the demon?

85
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,300
Lanie,please. Tell
me what happened.

86
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
It's very important.

87
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,000
Mom told me to go to
dad's medicine cabinet.

88
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,600
And?

89
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,100
<i>Take his sleeping pills --
Take all his sleeping pills!</i>

90
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
She wanted you to kill yourself?

91
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Why would my mom
want me to do that?

92
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,700
I don't know.

93
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,700
I mean,just so I could come to her?

94
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,700
What'd you say?

95
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,100
She wanted me to come to her.

96
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,600
No,no,no,no,no. How
did she say it exactly?

97
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,100
"Come to me --"
Like,a million times.

98
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,600
Lanie, that's not your mother.

99
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,800
All right,listen to me.

100
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,900
Don't answer the phone.
Don't use the computer.

101
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Don't do anything unless
i say to,all right?

102
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,100
Lanie.

103
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,800
Where's simon?

104
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,400
Hello?

105
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,600
Dean,it's not dad. What is it?

106
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,300
A crocotta. Is that a sandwich?

107
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,200
Some kind of scavenger
-- Mimics loved ones,

108
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Whispers "come to me,"

109
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,900
and loses you in the dark
and swallows your soul.

110
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,600
Crocotta -- Right.
Damn,that makes sense.

111
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,100
Dean,look. I'm
sorry,man. I know --

112
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,000
Hey,don't these things
live in filth? Yeah.

113
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,500
Sam,the flies at the phone company.

114
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,800
This is herman munster.
Leave a message.

115
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,300
Dean,I'm in the parking
lot. He's here. Hurry.

116
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,800
Whoa,what the hell?!

117
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
I know what you are.

118
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,800
Wait,mister,please. And
I know how to kill you.

119
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,100
Okay,wait,wait.

120
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,800
If we're overcharging
you for the call-Waiting

121
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,400
Something, i --
I can fix that.

122
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm your friend.

123
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,200
Just -- Just
don't kill me.

124
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,300
Don't kill me,please!

125
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,600
Yeah!

126
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
That's what happens

127
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,300
When you mess with the
phone company,dillweed!

128
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,100
Thank you,clark.

129
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,500
Forget about it.

130
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
Clark?

1
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm -- I'm
sorry,clark.

2
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,100
I'm sorry for
whatever I did to you.

3
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,700
I'm sorry. Please.

4
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,100
Wait! Wait. Don't do it.

5
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
You're awake.

6
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,700
You're not a killer,clark. No!

7
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,000
There's a -- There's a good
man inside of you. I know it.

8
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,500
What do you think,Sammy?

9
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,000
Am I a good man?

10
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,600
Just let him go.

11
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,300
I would. I really would.

12
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,400
If only I'd had more
than a salad for lunch.

13
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,300
See...

14
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,600
I'm starving.

15
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,500
No! Ugh!

16
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,900
My last call
with Dean --

17
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,000
It was you.

18
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,300
You led me here.

19
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Some calls I make,
some calls I take.

20
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,100
But you have to admit, i
had you fooled for a while.

21
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,900
All that edison phone crap...

22
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,400
oh,well.

23
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,300
What are you doing?

24
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm killing your brother.

25
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,400
Or maybe I'm killing another guy.

26
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,300
We'll just have to see how it goes.

27
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,400
Hello?

28
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,200
Hi,daddy.

29
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,100
Hey,baby.

30
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,500
I thought you said you
weren't gonna call anymore.

31
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,400
I know,daddy.

32
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,300
You know how sad this
makes your old man.

33
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,200
How upset I was at your funeral.

34
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,600
I had to call. I know
who killed me,daddy.

35
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,400
What?

36
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,100
The man who killed me --
He's at the house right now.

37
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,800
What -- What are
you saying to me?

38
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,300
He's at the house,daddy.
He wants to kill you,too.

39
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,100
You know,mimicking
Dean's one thing.

40
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,200
But my dad -- That's
a hell of a trick.

41
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,800
Ll,once I made you two
as hunters,it was easy.

42
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,700
Found Dean's number,
then your number,

43
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,900
Then your father's numbers,

44
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,400
Then to e-Mails,voice
mails -- Everything.

45
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,900
You see,people think that
that stuff just gets erased.

46
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,100
But it doesn't.

47
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,000
You'd be surprised at
how much of yourself

48
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,900
Is just floating out there,

49
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,700
waiting to be plucked.

50
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,200
Dean's not gonna fall for this.

51
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,300
He's not gonna kill that guy.

52
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,800
Then the guy killsuy

53
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,500
Technology...

54
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,900
...makes life so much easier.

55
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,800
It used to be I'd -- I'd
hide in the woods for days,

56
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,500
Weeks,

57
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,500
whispering to people,

58
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,900
Trying to draw them
out into the night.

59
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,200
But they had community.

60
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,800
They all looked out
after each other.

61
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,300
I'd be lucky to eat maybe
one, two souls a year.

62
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,500
But now when I'm hungry,
i simply make a phone call.

63
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,500
You're all so connected...

64
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,700
but you've never been so alone.

65
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
What is this?

66
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,100
Your funeral.

67
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,900
???

68
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,400
??

69
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,800
???

70
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,300
Did you do this to my daughter,too?

71
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,300
- How the hell did you get out?
- Did you do this to my daughter,too?!

72
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,600
- Wait.This is a mistake.
- You killed her.

73
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,000
You killed her, you son of a bitch!

74
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,500
She was 9 years old!

75
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,700
Stop! I didn't!

76
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,400
You got to believe me!

77
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,000
Why did you kill her?

78
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,800
I'm sorry.

79
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,700
I didn't kill your daughter.

80
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,500
Then what are you doing here?

81
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,900
I don't know.

1
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,100
Right back at you.

2
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,000
So,crocotta,huh?

3
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,400
Yep.

4
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,400
That would explain the flies.

5
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,600
Yeah,it would.

6
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Hey,um...

7
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,500
look,I'm sorry it wasn't dad.

8
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,400
I gave you a hell of
a time on this one.

9
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,900
No,you were right.

10
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,800
Forget about it.

11
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,300
I can't.

12
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,500
I wanted to believe so badly

13
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,900
That there was a way out of this.

14
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,200
I mean,I'm staring down
the barrel at this thing...

15
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,400
you know,hell...

16
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,300
for real,forever, and I'm just...

17
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,700
yeah.

18
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,100
I'm scared,Sam.

19
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,400
<i>I'm really scared.</i>

20
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,800
I know.

21
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,700
Ess I was willing to
believe anything --

22
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,000
You know,last act
of a desperate man.

23
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,800
There's nothing wrong
with having hope,you know.

24
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,300
Hope doesn't get you jack squat.

25
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,600
I can't expect dad to show up

26
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,900
With some miracle
at the last minute.

27
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,600
I can't expect
anybody to, you know?

28
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,500
And the only person that can
get me out of this thing is me.

29
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,900
And me.

30
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,400
"And me"?

31
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,300
What?

32
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,100
Deep revelation, having
a real moment here,

33
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,600
That's what you come
back with -- "And me"?

34
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,900
Want a poem?

35
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,200
Moment's gme

36
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,000
<i>Unbelievable. Roger smith...</i>
