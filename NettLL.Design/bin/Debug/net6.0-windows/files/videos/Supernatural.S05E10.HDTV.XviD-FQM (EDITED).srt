1
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:05,108
- Meg.
- Hi.

2
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:07,343
whoa, whoa!

3
00:00:07,377 --> 00:00:09,212
- You were hunting with Jo?
- Yeah, for a while now.

4
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:11,081
The mooks have melted down
the gun by now.

5
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:12,315
Well, I hear differently.

6
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,818
And if you are still set
on the insane task

7
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:17,320
of killing the devil,
this is how we do it.

8
00:00:17,354 --> 00:00:19,555
In chapter 33 of "supernatural,"
there was that girl, Bela.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,824
She stole the colt
from you,

10
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:22,859
and then she "said"
she gave it to Lilith, remember?

11
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:24,794
- Yeah.
- Well, you know she lied, right?

12
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,063
- She never really gave it to Lilith.
- What?

13
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:28,998
Bela gives the colt
to a demon named, Crowley.

14
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:30,633
Crowley?

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,014
Oh.

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,795
Mr. Pendleton, I presume.

17
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,429
The name's Crowley.

18
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:04,300
I-in my negotiations,
I was, uh,

19
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:06,903
dealing with a very young,
attractive, uh, lady.

20
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:08,838
Yes. I know.

21
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:11,775
But you,
piggy banker...

22
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:15,044
You... are a big fish

23
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,646
and I wanted
to do you the honor

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,248
of sealing this deal
personally.

25
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:21,251
But she said the deal
would be sealed with a kiss.

26
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:22,652
That's right.

27
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:27,190
No, I mean, she's...

28
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:28,524
Your choice.

29
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:33,129
You can cling to six decades
of deep-seated homophobia

30
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:35,265
or just give it up,

31
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,267
and get
a complete bailout

32
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,069
of your bank's
ridiculous incompetence.

33
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:42,939
There are just things...

34
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:44,240
Going once...

35
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:45,641
No, I don't think so.

36
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:46,642
Going twice...

37
00:01:46,677 --> 00:01:48,244
All right!
All right!

38
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:52,282
No!

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,427
Got him.

40
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:12,430
Supernatural Season 5 Episode 10
       "Abandon All Hope"

41
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,341
The demon Crowley
is making a deal,

42
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,377
even as we speak, it's...

43
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:23,412
Going... down.

44
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:26,316
"going down"?

45
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,416
Right.

46
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,152
Okay, huggy bear.
just don't lose him.

47
00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:30,486
I won't lose him.

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,322
Damn you.

49
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,660
Enjoy, the obscene wealth.

50
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:39,929
See you in 10 years.

51
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,347
I followed him.

52
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:59,648
It's not far, but...

53
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,954
It's layered in enochian 
warding magic.

54
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,424
I can't get in.

55
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,160
That's okay. You did great.
We'll take it from here.

56
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:24,573
# everybody plays the fool
sometimes #

57
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:28,778
# there's no exception
to the rule #

58
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,914
# listen, baby #

59
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:34,483
# it may be factual,
may be cruel #

60
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:36,719
# I ain't lyin' #

61
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:40,390
# everybody plays the fool #

62
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:48,031
Yeah?

63
00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:51,968
Hello? my car broke down.
I-I need some help.

64
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:53,937
I'll be down
in a minute.

65
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,853
Evening, pretty lady.

66
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:13,789
Get yourself
on in here.

67
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,891
I just need
to make a call.

68
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,428
You don't need
to call anyone, baby.

69
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:21,097
We're the only help
you're ever gonna need.

70
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,566
You know what, I...

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,568
I think I should wait
by my car.

72
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,206
We said get 
your ass in here.

73
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,749
Nice work, Jo.

74
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:41,784
Thanks.

75
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,588
Okay. Shall we?

76
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:48,191
# everybody plays the fool #

77
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:49,758
# listen to me, ba...#

78
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:00,303
It's "Crowley," right?

79
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:04,273
So... the hardy boys
finally found me.

80
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:06,376
Took you long enough.

81
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:26,829
Do you have any idea
how much this rug costs?

82
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,601
This is it, right?

83
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:37,373
This is, what it's all about.

84
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:52,788
We need to talk.

85
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:54,290
Privately.

86
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:00,229
What the hell
is this?

87
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,898
Do you know how deep
I could have buried this thing?

88
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:06,001
There's no reason
you or anyone

89
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:08,704
Should know
this even exists at all.

90
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:10,373
Except that I told you.

91
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,175
<i>You told us?</i>

92
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,278
Rumours, innuendo...
sent out on the grapevine.

93
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:17,012
Why?

94
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,182
Why tell us anything?

95
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:25,088
I want you, to take
this thing to Lucifer

96
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:27,390
and empty it
into his face.

97
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:29,092
Uh-huh.

98
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:30,393
Okay,

99
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:34,430
<i>and why exactly
would you want the devil dead?</i>

100
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:36,566
It's called...

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,202
Survival.

102
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:42,938
But I forgot... you two,
at best, are functional morons.

103
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:45,508
<i>Yeah, you're
functioning... morons.</i>

104
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,976
Mor...

105
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,413
Lucifer isn't a demon,
remember?

106
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:51,714
He's an angel...

107
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:55,118
an angel famous for
his hatred of humankind.

108
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:59,288
To him, you're just...
filthy bags of pus.

109
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:01,757
<i>If that's the way
he feels about you...</i>

110
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,560
<i>what can he think
about us?</i>

111
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,164
But he created you.

112
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:10,199
To him, we're just servants.

113
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:11,900
Cannon fodder.

114
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:15,871
If Lucifer manages
to exterminate humankind...

115
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,408
we're next.

116
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:22,612
So...

117
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,013
Help me.

118
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,080
Huh?

119
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:28,017
Let's all go back
to simpler, better times.

120
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:31,086
Back to... when we could all
follow our natures.

121
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:33,189
I'm in sales, damn it.

122
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,191
So, what do you say?

123
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:37,326
What if...

124
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,162
I give you this thing...

125
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:41,430
And you go kill the devil?

126
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:49,672
Okay.

127
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:51,073
Great.

128
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,679
You wouldn't
happen to know

129
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,549
<i>where the devil is,
by chance, would you?</i>

130
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,217
Thursday.

131
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,286
Birdies tell me...

132
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,021
He has an appointment
in Carthage, Missouri.

133
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,593
Great.

134
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:11,627
Thanks.

135
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,871
Oh, yeah, right. You probably
need some more ammunition.

136
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:27,009
Uh, excuse me
for asking,

137
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:29,144
But aren't you kind of signing
your own death warrant?

138
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,880
I mean, what happens to you

139
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,783
If we go up against
the devil and lose?

140
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,486
Number one... he's gonna
wipe us all out anyway.

141
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:39,255
Two... after you leave here,

142
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,124
I go on an extended vacation
to all points nowhere.

143
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,594
And three... how about
you don't miss?!

144
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:46,028
Okay?!

145
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:47,996
Morons!

146
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,979
All right, big boy.
Let's go.

147
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,428
I think I'm starting
to feel something.

148
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:23,366
It's got to be
a trap, right?

149
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:27,536
Sam Winchester having
trust issues with a demon.

150
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:29,305
Well, better late than never.

151
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,808
Yeah, and thank you again
for your continued support.

152
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:33,842
You're welcome.

153
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:40,149
And, you know,
trap or no trap,

154
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:42,885
We got a snowball's chance,
we got to take it, right?

155
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:46,622
Yeah, I suppose.

156
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:48,924
<i>Besides, I'm not sure
it is a trap.</i>

157
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,025
Check it out.

158
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:52,961
Carthage is lit up
like a Christmas tree

159
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:55,598
With revelation omens.

160
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,232
And look at this

161
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,735
there's been six
missing persons reported

162
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,737
In town, since Sunday.

163
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,107
I think the devil's there.

164
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:07,576
Okay.

165
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:09,779
Look, when you think about it...

166
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,549
you can't come with.

167
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,650
Dean...

168
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:18,153
Look, I go against Satan
and screw the pooch...

169
00:10:18,188 --> 00:10:19,755
Okay.

170
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,425
We've lost a game piece,
that we can take.

171
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:23,793
<i>But if you're there...</i>

172
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:27,630
Then we are handing the devil's
vessel right over to him.

173
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:28,831
That's not smart.

174
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:30,466
Since when have we ever
done anything smart?

175
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,934
I'm serious, Sam.

176
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,235
So am I.

177
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,970
Haven't we learned
a damn thing?

178
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:39,107
<i>If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it together.</i>

179
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:48,584
Okay.

180
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,487
That's, a stupid friggin' idea.

181
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:02,965
Boy, talk about
stupid ideas.

182
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:05,234
Good god.

183
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,102
True, that.

184
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:13,208
Mm.

185
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:14,710
- Hey.
- Hey.

186
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:19,548
So...

187
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,851
Dangerous mission
tomorrow.

188
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:22,852
Mm.

189
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:24,953
Guess it's time to...

190
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:28,056
Eat, drink, and...
you know...

191
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:29,392
Make merry.

192
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:33,195
Are you giving me the
"Last night on earth", speech?

193
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:34,363
What?

194
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:35,163
What?

195
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:36,665
No.

196
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,833
No.

197
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:42,538
<i>If I was, would, uh...
w-would that work?</i>

198
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,418
No.

199
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:58,220
Sweetheart, if this is
our last night on earth,

200
00:11:58,254 --> 00:11:59,955
Then I'm going to spend it

201
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:02,825
With a little thing
I call, "self-respect."

202
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,863
If you're into
that kind of thing.

203
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:10,065
Everybody, get in here!

204
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,067
It's time for the line-up.

205
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,869
Usual suspects,
in the corner.

206
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:15,504
Oh, come on, Bobby.

207
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,473
Nobody wants
their picture taken.

208
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:18,541
Hear, hear.

209
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,943
<i>Shut up.
you're drinkin' my beer.</i>

210
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,646
Anyway...

211
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,983
I'm gonna need something
to remember your sorry asses by.

212
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,117
Ha!

213
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:31,987
Always good
to have an optimist around.

214
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,255
Bobby's right.

215
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,090
Tomorrow we hunt the devil.

216
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:37,392
This is our last night on earth.

217
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,630
You getting a signal?

218
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,365
No, nothin'.

219
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,534
Nice and spooky.

220
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:29,244
Place seem
a little empty to you?

221
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,612
We're gonna go
check out the PD.

222
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,614
You guys stay here,
see if you can find anybody.

223
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,283
Okay.

224
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:48,698
Ever heard of
a door handle?

225
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:50,332
Of course I have.

226
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,571
What is it, Cass?

227
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:57,573
This town's not empty.

228
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,313
Reapers.

229
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:08,283
"Reapers"? As in more than one?

230
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:12,421
They only gather like this
at times of great catastrophe...

231
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:15,557
Chicago fire,
San Francisco quake...

232
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:17,159
Pompeii.

233
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:19,461
Excuse me. I need to find out
why they're here.

234
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,580
Hello, brother.

235
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:17,887
Station's empty.

236
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,121
So is everything else.

237
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:20,256
Have you seen, Cass?

238
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,924
<i>What?
He was with you.</i>

239
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,826
Nope. He went after
the reapers.

240
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,994
Reapers?

241
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:26,662
He saw reapers, Where?

242
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:28,964
Well, kind of...
everywhere.

243
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:48,984
Lucifer.

244
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:53,823
So, I take it you're here
with the Winchesters.

245
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:57,759
I came alone.

246
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:00,729
Loyalty.

247
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:04,433
Such a nice quality to see
in this day and age.

248
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:07,870
"Castiel," right?

249
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,441
Castiel...

250
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:15,344
I'm told you came here
in an auto mobile.

251
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,114
Yes.

252
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,415
What was that like?

253
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,551
Um...

254
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:23,585
Slow.

255
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:26,455
Confining.

256
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,690
What a peculiar
thing you are.

257
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:33,395
What's wrong
with your vessel?

258
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:36,665
Yes, um...

259
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:39,835
Nick is wearing a
bit thin, I'm afraid.

260
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,338
He can't contain me
forever, so...

261
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,638
You...

262
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:51,380
You are not taking
Sam Winchester.

263
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:54,616
I won't let you.

264
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,650
Castiel.

265
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,856
<i>I don't understand
why you're fighting me,</i>

266
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:01,957
Of all the angels.

267
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:03,359
You really have to ask?

268
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:05,527
I rebelled, I was cast out.

269
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:08,630
<i>You rebelled.
You were cast out.</i>

270
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:11,033
Almost all of heaven
wants to see me dead,

271
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,769
and if they succeed,
guess what?

272
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:17,639
You're their new public
enemy number one.

273
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,544
We're on the same side,
like it or not, so...

274
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:24,947
Why not just serve
your own best interests?

275
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:27,449
Which, in this case,
just happen to be mine.

276
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:31,453
I'll die first.

277
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:38,894
I suppose you will.

278
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:47,769
Well, this is great. we've been
in town for 20 minutes.

279
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:50,139
We've already lost
the angel up our sleeve.

280
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:52,174
You think, uh...
you think Lucifer got him?

281
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,676
<i>I don't know
what else to think.</i>

282
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:57,579
There you are.

283
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:00,983
Meg!

284
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:04,219
You shouldn't have
come here, boys.

285
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:07,089
<i>Yeah? well, I could say
the same thing for you.</i>

286
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:10,292
Didn't come
here alone, Dean-o.

287
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:20,069
Hell hounds!

288
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:22,204
Yeah, Dean...
your favorite.

289
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,506
Come on, boys.

290
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,008
My father
wants to see you.

291
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,542
I think we'll pass. Thanks.

292
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:28,877
Your call.

293
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:30,245
You can make this easy,

294
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,781
or you can make it
really, really hard.

295
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:40,922
When have you known us
to ever make anything easy?

296
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:45,527
Run!

297
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:57,239
Dean!

298
00:18:57,273 --> 00:18:58,340
Jo, stay back!

299
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:07,449
No!

300
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:08,950
Aaaaah!

301
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:24,666
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

302
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:28,670
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

303
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:29,971
I'm fine. I'm fine.

304
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:31,340
Boys, need some help here!

305
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,345
You all right?

306
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:53,728
Ohhh!

307
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:55,197
Ohh!

308
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,005
Ohhh...

309
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,174
It'll be all right. Okay?
You're gonna be all right.

310
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,175
Thank you.

311
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,144
How's she holding up?

312
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,987
The salt lines
are holding up.

313
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,654
Safe for now.

314
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:27,359
Yeah, safe
or trapped like rats.

315
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:30,994
Hey, you heard Meg.

316
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:32,963
Her father's here.

317
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:34,065
This is our one shot, Sammy.

318
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,433
We got to take it,
no matter what.

319
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,137
There we go.

320
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:42,872
Sam, some help here, please?

321
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,275
<i>The number you dilled
is unavailable.</i>

322
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,410
<i>please try your call again...</i>

323
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:49,145
Damn it, boys.

324
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:04,127
KC5 Fox Delta Oscar,
go ahead.

325
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:07,563
Bobby, it's Dean.
we got problems.

326
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,836
It's okay, boy.
that's why I'm here.

327
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,771
Is everyone all right?

328
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,573
No.

329
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:18,908
Uh, I-It's...

330
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:21,144
It's Jo. Bobby, it's pretty bad.

331
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,983
Okay. Copy that.

332
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:29,252
So now we figure
what we do next.

333
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:33,222
Bobby, I don't think she's...

334
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:41,731
I said,
"what do we do next," Dean.

335
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,172
Right.

336
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:51,307
Okay. Right.

337
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:54,778
Now... tell me what you got.

338
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:59,382
Before he went missing,
did Cass say how many reapers?

339
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,884
I-I don't know.

340
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:02,052
He said a lot of things, I guess.

341
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:03,153
I mean, does the number matter?

342
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:05,822
Devil's in the details, Dean.

343
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:09,726
Bobby, it's Ellen.

344
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,994
The way he was looking,

345
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:13,229
The number of places
Castiel's eyes went,

346
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:15,865
I'd say we're talking over a
dozen reapers, probably more.

347
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,636
I do not like
the sound of that.

348
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:23,740
Nobody likes the
sound of that, Bobby, but...

349
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:26,076
<i>what... what does
that sound like?</i>

350
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,411
It sounds like death, son.

351
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:31,314
I think Satan's in town
to work a ritual.

352
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:35,651
I think he's planning
to unleash death.

353
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:40,256
You mean like, as in this dude
and taxes are the only sure thing?

354
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,928
<i>As in death... The Horseman,
the pale rider in the flesh.</i>

355
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:46,196
"Unleash"?

356
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,564
I mean, h-hasn't death been
tromping all over the place?

357
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,433
I mean, hell, I died
several times myself.

358
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,667
Not this guy.

359
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:54,270
<i>This is... this is
the angel of death,</i>

360
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:55,571
Big daddy reaper.

361
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:58,674
They keep this guy chained
in a box 600 feet under.

362
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:02,378
Last time they hauled him up,
Noah was building a boat.

363
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,649
That's why the place
is crawling with reapers.

364
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:09,318
They're waiting
on the big boss to show.

365
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,026
<i>You have
any other good news?</i>

366
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:19,062
Well, in a manner of speaking.

367
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:23,032
I've been researching Carthage
since you've been gone,

368
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,200
Trying to suss out

369
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:25,802
what the devil
might want there.

370
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:29,105
What you just said drops the
last piece of the puzzle in place.

371
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,575
The angel of death must
be brought into this world

372
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:35,779
at midnight through a place
of awful carnage.

373
00:23:35,813 --> 00:23:37,413
Now, back during the civil war,

374
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:39,149
there was a battle
in Carthage...

375
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:40,283
a battle so intense,

376
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:42,919
the soldiers called it
"The battle of hell-hole."

377
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,822
Where'd the massacre go down?

378
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:49,859
On the land of
William Jasper's farm.

379
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,670
I got the Winchesters
pinned down...

380
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:02,571
For now, at least.

381
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:04,607
What should I do
with them?

382
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:07,110
Leave them alone.

383
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:09,946
I-I'm sorry,
but are you sure?

384
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,947
Shouldn't we...

385
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:13,149
Trust me, child.

386
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:15,551
Everything happens
for a reason.

387
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:21,324
Well, Castiel...

388
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:23,759
You have some time.

389
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,763
Time to change your mind.

390
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:35,604
So, now we know
where the devil's gonna be,

391
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,941
we know when,
and we have the colt.

392
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:39,142
Yeah.

393
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:42,145
We just have to get past...
eight or so hell hounds

394
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,013
and get to the
farm by midnight.

395
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:47,783
Yeah, and that's after we get
Jo and Ellen the hell out of town.

396
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,019
Won't be easy.

397
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:51,020
Stretcher?

398
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:52,621
I'll see what we got.

399
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,524
Stop.

400
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,293
Guys, stop.

401
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:03,499
Can we, uh, be realistic
about this, please?

402
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:13,776
I can't move my legs.

403
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,211
I can't be moved.

404
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:20,049
My guts are being held in
by an ace bandage.

405
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,252
We got to...

406
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,553
We got to get our
priorities straight here.

407
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:31,394
Number one...
I'm not going anywhere.

408
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:33,696
Joanna Beth, you stop
talking like that...

409
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,797
Mom.

410
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:38,268
I can't fight.

411
00:25:38,302 --> 00:25:40,336
I can't walk.

412
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:43,206
<i>But I can do something.</i>

413
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,210
We've got propane, wiring,
rock salt, iron nails...

414
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:49,045
Everything we need.

415
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:51,547
Everything we need?

416
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,182
To build a bomb, Sam.

417
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:56,519
No!

418
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:58,221
Jo... no.

419
00:25:58,255 --> 00:25:59,923
You got another plan?

420
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:02,858
<i>you got any other plan?</i>

421
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:07,063
Those are hell hounds
out there, Dean.

422
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:12,902
They've got
all of our scents.

423
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:17,907
<i>Those bitches will never
stop coming after you.</i>

424
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,114
We let the dogs in,

425
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,782
you guys hit the roof,

426
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:29,152
make a break for
the building next over,

427
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:31,988
and I can wait here
with my finger on the button.

428
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:34,790
Rip those mutts
a new one.

429
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:37,793
Or at least get you a few
minutes' head start, anyway.

430
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,332
No, I... I won't let you.

431
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,633
This is why we're here, right?

432
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,971
If I can get us
a shot on the devil...

433
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:51,407
Dean, we have to take it.

434
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:52,575
No!

435
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,577
That's not...

436
00:26:54,611 --> 00:26:55,945
Mom.

437
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:58,214
<i>This might literally be</i>

438
00:26:58,248 --> 00:27:00,649
your last chance
to treat me like an adult.

439
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:03,853
You might want
to take it.

440
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,142
You heard her.

441
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,478
Get to work.

442
00:28:18,895 --> 00:28:20,729
Okay, this is it.

443
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:24,800
I'll see you
on the other side.

444
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:28,737
Probably sooner than later.

445
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,342
Make it later.

446
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:17,653
Okay.

447
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:46,149
Mom, no.

448
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:48,351
Somebody's
got to let them in,

449
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:51,920
and like you said,
you're not moving.

450
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:56,058
<i>You got me, Jo.</i>

451
00:29:58,362 --> 00:30:00,029
And you're right

452
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:01,597
<i>this is important.</i>

453
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,268
But I will not
leave you here alone.

454
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,038
Dean?

455
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:10,873
Get goin' now, boys.

456
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:12,175
Ellen?

457
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,777
I said go,

458
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,415
and, Dean...

459
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:22,951
Kick it in the ass.

460
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:26,656
Don't miss.

461
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:14,303
I will always love you, baby.

462
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:16,339
I...

463
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:24,513
Honey?

464
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:28,384
Jo...

465
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:38,427
It's okay.

466
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:40,730
It's okay.

467
00:31:41,998 --> 00:31:43,566
That's my good girl.

468
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:14,096
You can go straight back
to hell, you ugly bitch!

469
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:44,927
I guess we know what happened
to some of the towns people.

470
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:47,730
Okay.

471
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,565
Okay.

472
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,200
Last words?

473
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:00,710
I think I'm good.

474
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:04,680
Yeah. Me too.

475
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:11,787
Here goes nothin'.

476
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,234
Hey!

477
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:31,374
You wanted to see me?!

478
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,879
Well, Sam, you don't
need that gun here.

479
00:33:39,716 --> 00:33:42,184
You know I'd never hurt you.

480
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:43,552
Not really.

481
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:47,523
Yeah?

482
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:49,024
<i>Well, I'd hurt you.</i>

483
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:52,361
So suck it.

484
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:14,216
Owww!

485
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,293
Where did you get that?

486
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:35,771
Now...

487
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:37,172
Where were we?

488
00:34:43,173 --> 00:34:44,573
Don't feel too bad, Sam.

489
00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:47,956
There's only five things
in all of creation

490
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,224
That, that gun can't kill,

491
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:51,860
and... I just happen to be
one of them.

492
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:55,597
But if you give me a minute,
I'm almost done.

493
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:02,271
You know...

494
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:07,075
I don't suppose you'd just
say "yes" right here and now?

495
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:10,646
End this whole
tiresome discussion?

496
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,213
That's crazy, right?

497
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:14,349
<i>It's never gonna happen!</i>

498
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:16,050
Oh, I don't know, Sam.

499
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:17,586
I think it will.

500
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,221
I think it'll happen soon...

501
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:22,391
Within six months.

502
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:25,394
And I think it'll
happen... in Detroit.

503
00:35:25,428 --> 00:35:29,364
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

504
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:31,533
I'm gonna kill you myself.

505
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:33,335
You understand me?

506
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:35,937
I'm going to
rip your heart out!

507
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:37,339
That's good, Sam.

508
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:40,609
You keep fanning
that fire in your belly...

509
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:42,444
All that pent-up rage.

510
00:35:42,478 --> 00:35:45,213
I'm gonna need it.

511
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:50,552
What did you do?

512
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:52,120
What did you do
to this town?

513
00:35:52,154 --> 00:35:54,756
Oh, I was very generous
with this town.

514
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:57,626
One demon for
every able-bodied man.

515
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,260
And the rest of them?

516
00:36:02,898 --> 00:36:03,898
In there.

517
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:09,538
I know... it's awful, but...

518
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:11,540
These horsemen
are so demanding.

519
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:16,110
So it was... women and children first.

520
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,017
I know what you must
think of me, Sam.

521
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:26,421
<i>But I have to do this.</i>

522
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:28,289
<i>I have to.</i>

523
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:30,525
You, of all people,
should understand.

524
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:34,229
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

525
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:39,300
I was a son.

526
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,135
A brother, like you.

527
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,838
A younger brother,

528
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:46,241
and I had an older
brother who I loved.

529
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:47,976
Idolized, in fact.

530
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,745
And one day,
I went to him

531
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:53,314
and I begged him
to stand with me,

532
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:56,050
and Michael...

533
00:36:57,687 --> 00:37:00,655
Michael turned on me.

534
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,457
Called me a freak.

535
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,527
A monster,

536
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:08,296
and then he beat me down.

537
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,665
All because
I was different.

538
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,268
Because I had
a mind of my own.

539
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:16,271
Tell me something, Sam.

540
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:18,840
Any of this
sound familiar?

541
00:37:22,945 --> 00:37:24,112
Anyway...

542
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:28,016
You'll have to excuse me.
Midnight is calling

543
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,452
and I have a ritual to finish.

544
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:31,620
Don't go anywhere.

545
00:37:31,654 --> 00:37:34,122
Not that you could
if you would.

546
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,840
Now, repeat after me.

547
00:37:51,874 --> 00:37:56,411
We offer up our lives, blood, souls...

548
00:37:56,446 --> 00:38:00,582
we offer up
our lives, blood, souls...

549
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:04,784
- To complete this tribute.
- To complete this tribute.

550
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:20,301
What?

551
00:38:25,942 --> 00:38:28,510
They're just demons.

552
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:39,754
You seem pleased.

553
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,091
We're gonna win.

554
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,960
Can you feel it?

555
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:50,699
You cloud-hopping pansies
lost the whole damn universe.

556
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:54,636
Lucifer's gonna take over heaven.

557
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,038
We're goin' to heaven, Clarence.

558
00:38:58,674 --> 00:38:59,674
Strange.

559
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:01,676
Because I heard
a different theory

560
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:03,378
from a demon
named Crowley.

561
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:06,214
You don't know Crowley.

562
00:39:06,248 --> 00:39:09,450
He believes that Lucifer
is just using demons

563
00:39:09,485 --> 00:39:11,486
to achieve an end,

564
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:12,687
and that...

565
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:15,557
once he does...

566
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:18,727
he'll destroy you all.

567
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:20,061
You're wrong.

568
00:39:20,095 --> 00:39:22,664
Lucifer is the father of our race...

569
00:39:22,698 --> 00:39:24,265
Our creator.

570
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:28,369
<i>Your god may be a
deadbeat, but mine...</i>

571
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:29,905
Mine walks the earth.

572
00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:45,453
You can't gank demons, can you?

573
00:39:45,487 --> 00:39:47,455
You're cut off
from the home office,

574
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:50,158
and you ain't got the juice.

575
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:53,895
<i>So, what can you do,
you impotent sap?</i>

576
00:39:55,798 --> 00:39:57,632
I can do this.

577
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,840
Oh, hello, death.

578
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:47,841
Just received an update
as the governor has declared

579
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:49,642
<i>a state of emergency
for Paulding County,</i>

580
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:53,478
<i>including the towns of Marion,
Fayetteville, and Carthage.</i>

581
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,114
<i>the storm system
has reportedly touched off</i>

582
00:40:56,148 --> 00:40:57,982
<i>a number of tornadoes
in the area.</i>

583
00:40:58,017 --> 00:40:59,984
<i>death tolls have
yet to be estimated.</i>

584
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:03,554
<i>but state officials expect
the loss of life and property</i>

585
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:04,555
<i>To be staggering.</i>
