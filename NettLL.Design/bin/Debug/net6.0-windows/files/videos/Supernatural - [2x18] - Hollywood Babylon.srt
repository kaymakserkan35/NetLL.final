1
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,980
Wendy, they're dead!

2
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,990
Brody, pull it together.

3
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,580
We don't have a chance, okay?

4
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,980
We have to get out of here now!

5
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,560
No, Brody.We are not leaving.

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,210
We have got to find my sister.

7
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:02,950
No!

8
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,800
No, I am getting out of here right now!

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,740
Brody!

10
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,220
Brody, get back here!

11
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,640
Brody!

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,070
God, you son of a bitch!

13
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,620
Cut.

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,540
What the hell was that?

15
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,470
Thanks.

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,460
Here you go.

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,730
Thanks, Walter.

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,230
Don't mark that.

19
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,290
It's all good, Tara.

20
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,750
That was great.

21
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,940
Uh, let's do it again.

22
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,630
Uh, maybe we try dialing
up that scream, huh?

23
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,540
I know, I know.

24
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,810
I'm just -- I'm having
trouble with the tennis ball.

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,060
That is just for cg registration.

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,870
When ivan and the fx guys are done,
it is going to look terrifying.

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,630
You want to look at the
concept sketches again?

28
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,660
No, that's okay.

29
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,530
I'll find it.

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,100
I know you will, pumpkin, huh?

31
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,990
Okay.

32
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,350
Going again, everybody.

33
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,980
10-Minute reload for camera and sound.

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,130
No, man, I'm telling you.

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,530
Working alone behind the sets or after
wrap, I catch this weird vibe sometimes.

36
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,020
Like what?

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,990
Mmm, like something's watching.

38
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,980
Come on.

39
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,230
Hey.

40
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,930
Working on a movie like this?

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,070
Weird crap's bound to happen.

42
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,680
Frank thinks the stage is
haunted. Like, for real.

43
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,840
All I'm saying is, they call wrap,
I get done, and I get out of here.

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,360
Fast.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,370
Guy is definitely off his meds.

46
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,560
Brody, come back.

47
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,020
You son of a bitch.

48
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,660
Brody, come back, you son of a bitch.

49
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,900
Hello?

50
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,190
Guys?

51
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,580
Come on.

52
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,580
It's not funny.

53
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,670
Okay.

54
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,810
Ha ha, very funny.

55
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,570
Hello?

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,280
Who's there?

57
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,740
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

58
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:35,260
First opened in 1927, the lot has been
in continuous operation for eight decades.

59
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,810
Hey, you know this is where
they filmed "Creepshow"?

60
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,540
Now to the right here is Stars Hollow.

61
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,390
It's the setting for the
television series "Gilmore Girls."

62
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:53,020
And if we're lucky, we might even
catch one of the show's stars.

63
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,470
Come on.

64
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,150
Let's finish the tour.

65
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:03,040
And then up to the right here, we have New York
Avenue, and that's where they shot "Lois & Clark."

66
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,480
Sammy, check it out.

67
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,090
It's matt damon.

68
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,430
Yeah.

69
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,730
I'm pretty sure that's not Matt Damon.

70
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,590
No, it is.

71
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,550
Well, Matt Damon just picked
up a broom and started sweeping.

72
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,700
Yeah, he was probably
researching a role or something.

73
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,840
Uh, I don't think so.

74
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,110
Hey, this way.

75
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,180
Uh, I think stage 9's over here.

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,780
Come on, man.

77
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,770
Let's keep going this way.

78
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,500
No, come on.

79
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,260
We got to work.

80
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,950
Golly.

81
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,140
Dude, you wanted to come to L.A.

82
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,340
Yeah, for a vacation!

83
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,710
I mean, swimming pools and movie stars!

84
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,770
Not to work.

85
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,290
This seem like swimming
pool weather to you, Dean?

86
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,760
It's practically canadian.

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,030
Yeah.

88
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,720
I just figured that, you know, after everything that happened
with madison, you could use a little R&R,  that's all.

89
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,790
Maybe I want to work, Dean.

90
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,090
Maybe it keeps my mind off things.

91
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, okay, all right.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,830
So this crew guy, what,
did he ...he died on set?

93
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah, rumors spreading
like wildfire online.

94
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,270
They're saying the set's haunted.

95
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,820
Like "poltergeist"?

96
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,160
Could be a poltergeist.

97
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,730
No, no, no.

98
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,420
The movie "poltergeist."

99
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,910
You know nothing of your
cultural heritage, do you?

100
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,010
It was rumored that the set of "poltergeist" was
cursed, that they used real human bones as props.

101
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,600
Like, at least three of
the actors died in it.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,810
Yeah, might be something like that.

103
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,740
All right, so this crew guy.

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,680
What's his name?

105
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,930
Frank Jaffe.

106
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,080
You got a death certificate
or a coroner's report?

107
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,920
Well, no, but, uh, it's L.A., You know?

108
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,340
That might not even be his real name.

109
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,120
But the girl who found him, she said
she saw something ... a vanishing figure.

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
What's the girl's name?

111
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,080
Uh, Tara Benchley.

112
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,260
Whoa, Tara Benchley?

113
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,260
From "feardotcom" and
"ghost ship" Tara Benchley?

114
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,100
Dude, why didn't you say so?

115
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,440
So now you're suddenly on board?

116
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,110
I mean, I'm a fan of her work.

117
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,490
It's very good.

118
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,790
No, look.

119
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,510
Don't get me wrong.

120
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,420
Everyone at this studio loves
the dailies, myself included.

121
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,990
We were just wondering if it could be...

122
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,850
You know, a little brighter.

123
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,470
Brighter?

124
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,650
Yeah, Jay, more color.

125
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,790
Mcg, you know what I'm saying.

126
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,140
You're the master of that stuff.

127
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,880
Brad, this is a horror movie.

128
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,550
Who says horror has to be dark?

129
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,720
It's just -- It's sort of
depressing, don't you think?

130
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,650
Uh, excuse me.

131
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,530
Uh, green-Shirt guy?

132
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,110
Yeah, yeah, you.Come here.

133
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,140
Can you get me a, uh,
smoothie from craft?

134
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,060
You want a what from who?

135
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,250
You are a P.A.

136
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,560
This is what you do.

137
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,540
Yeah, he, uh...

138
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,030
One smoothie coming right up.

139
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,530
What's a P.A.?

140
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,580
I think they're kind of like slaves.

141
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,100
They'll let anybody
in this business, huh?

142
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,190
6, 6, 6. Mark.

143
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,620
Ready!

144
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,500
Okay, why don't we take it
from, "come on, it'll be fun"?

145
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,720
And action.

146
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,280
Come on.

147
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,660
It'll be fun.

148
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,590
Dicta sunt explicabo.

149
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,000
God, I hate you so much right now.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,180
Cut!

151
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,360
Very nice.

152
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,930
So?

153
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,710
No emf anywhere.

154
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,400
Great.

155
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,190
So, what do you think?

156
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,200
Well, I think being a P.A.Sucks, but...

157
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,220
But the food these people get?

158
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,840
Are you kidding me?

159
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,260
I mean, look at these things.

160
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,490
They're like miniature
philly cheesesteak sandwiches.

161
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,940
They're delicious.

162
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,420
Maybe later.

163
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,060
What did you find out
about the dead crew guy?

164
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,030
Uh, Frank Jaffe was just
filling in for the day.

165
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,370
Nobody here knew him or
where he lived or anything.

166
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:45,950
Oh, great.

167
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,200
So you found out about as much as I did.

168
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,120
Hey, guys.

169
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,170
Oh, hey.

170
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,630
They're wonderful.

171
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,680
Listen.

172
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,850
I did dig up some stuff
about stage 9's history.

173
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,260
Four people died messy here over the past 80
years, two suicides and two fatal accidents.

174
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,890
Any one of those could
be a vengeful spirit.

175
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,220
Yeah.

176
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,100
Just got to narrow it down more.

177
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,150
I'll get right on that.

178
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,260
Hey, are you supposed
to get one of these?

179
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,920
I..I don't really know what I'm doing.

180
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,060
First day?

181
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,980
Yeah, my big break.

182
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,550
You know, I know it's really uncool
to say this, but I'm a big fan.

183
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,750
I loved you in "boogeyman."

184
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,730
Oh, god.

185
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,760
What a terrible script.

186
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,100
Uh, but, thank you.

187
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,610
Yeah.

188
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,590
You found him, right?

189
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,850
The -- The
dead guy?

190
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,330
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,720
You probably don't
want to talk about this.

192
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,190
No, no, actually,
it's -- It's okay.

193
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,660
Nobody around here really
brings it up very much.

194
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,120
I think they're all scared I'm
gonna have some kind of breakdown.

195
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,020
That must have been awful.

196
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,310
What happened?

197
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,100
It was horrible.

198
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:27,730
There ... there was all this blood coming
from his eyes, from his mouth, and, uh...

199
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,990
I saw this, um...

200
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,830
What?

201
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,010
I saw this shape.

202
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,970
To tell you the truth, I
don't know actually what I saw.

203
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,770
I just know I saw it.

204
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,830
Thanks, Walter.

205
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,940
Uh, so this -- This crew
guy Frank, did you know him?

206
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,140
No, not that well.

207
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,730
That's funny.

208
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,200
It's like no one around
here actually knew the guy.

209
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,480
I got his picture.

210
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,360
You do?

211
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,150
Yeah.

212
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,510
I take polaroids of all the crew.

213
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,200
It's just one of those things
you do to kill time on the set.

214
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,490
Right there.

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,830
Son of a bitch.

216
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,210
Gerard st.James?

217
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,480
Yes?

218
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,310
You're still alive, and
you're not Frank Jaffe.

219
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,510
NO

220
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,180
You were -- You were desert soldier number 4
in "Metalstorm: The destruction of jared-Syn."

221
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,060
I was.

222
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,770
I knew I recognized you.

223
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,670
I am a huge fan.

224
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,620
I mean, your turn as the tractor-Crash
victim in "Critters 3" ...wow.

225
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,570
Hey, well, please.

226
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,340
Come in.

227
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,270
Thanks.

228
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,470
Yeah, it was the producers.

229
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,610
I mean, they brought me in
for the day to play Frank.

230
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,760
Just to fake your death?

231
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,270
Well, rumors of a haunted film set...

232
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:16,880
Free publicity, especially when you're making a horror
movie I mean, it's already all over the internet.

233
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah, we know.

234
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,050
These days, it's all about
new media, building buzz.

235
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,250
They say I'm the new "lonelygirl."

236
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,840
Who?

237
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,760
And the ghost Tara saw?

238
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,280
Projected on a screen of diffusion.

239
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,990
Isn't that kind of cruel...

240
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,380
Messing with their heads like that?

241
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,390
Hey, I just play the part.

242
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,040
I don't write the script.

243
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,010
Speaking of...

244
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:48,470
I'm playing willy in a dinner-Theater production
of "salesman" at costa mesa all next month.

245
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,430
Get a free pepper steak with the coupon.

246
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,180
Well, now, wait a second.

247
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,510
If you're seen in public,
won't that ruin the hoax?

248
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,750
Oh, please.

249
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,410
Frank and willy, , ,
totally different characters.

250
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,760
You know what?

251
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Thanks very much, Mr. Saint.James.

252
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,750
It was just nagging at us.

253
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,820
But we're ...we're very glad,
you know, you're alive and well.

254
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,160
Yeah.

255
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,290
Absolutely.

256
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,320
I wanted to ask you.

257
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,810
What was it like working
with Richard Moll?

258
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,850
He's from "metalstorm."

259
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,110
He was Hurok, King
of the Cyclops people.

260
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,010
Gentleman's gentleman.

261
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,380
Yeah?

262
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,620
All right.

263
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,100
Pepper steak.

264
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,340
When we read from that book, we must
have brought them back...back from hell.

265
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,490
Now they're trying to use us...

266
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,880
It doesn't matter.

267
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,030
We're not going till we
find Wendy and her sister.

268
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,380
Got it?

269
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,300
Good.

270
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,910
Now, let's get busy.

271
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,690
Cut!

272
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,550
No good for sound.

273
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,490
I'm getting some kind of feedback.

274
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,160
Another costly sound delay.

275
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,060
All right, we're going
again for sound, people!

276
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,520
Thank you!

277
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,930
No, it's a great scene,
really ..Dynamite.

278
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,080
But I still got a few...

279
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,330
Not -- Not problems,
just questions.

280
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,670
Like what?

281
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,280
Well, for one thing. The rules
aren't really landing for me.

282
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,570
Like, the kids do this latin chant,
and that makes the ghosts show up?

283
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,660
Yeah.

284
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,670
If the ghosts are in hell,
how do they hear the chanting?

285
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,580
I mean, what, do they
have super hearing?

286
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,680
Well, it's a logic bump.

287
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,310
The rules don't track.

288
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,080
Marty, you're the writer.

289
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,690
What about throwing in an explainer?

290
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,450
Yeah, that'd be super.

291
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,070
I got to check some messages.

292
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,690
Suits.

293
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,260
Has mcg seen this?

294
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,340
I like the whole body-Paint,
black-And-White thing, but, gee, I...

295
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,460
I don't think those neck wounds
are really gonna read on-Camera.

296
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,770
They need to be red.

297
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,470
You know what I'm saying?

298
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,650
Hey, Jay!

299
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,640
I need to speak to makeup.

300
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,340
Yeah?

301
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,460
Wait up.

302
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,050
When we read from that book, we must
have brought them back ...back from hell.

303
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,260
I don't understand.

304
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,450
If they were in hell, how
could they hear our chanting?

305
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,380
They must have super hearing.

306
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,140
Wendy?

307
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,980
Oh, Mitch!

308
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,230
God, you're alive!

309
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,000
You won't get rid of me that easy.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,250
Rumble, rumble, rumble!

311
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,270
Salt.

312
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,250
Okay, we need salt.

313
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,440
I read in that book that
it keeps ghosts away.

314
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,390
Kendra, logan, you guys check the back.

315
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,680
The poor bastard killed
himself, like, for real.

316
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,390
Shouldn't we shut it down or something?

317
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,030
We had a moment of silence
for him at breakfast.

318
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,820
He was just a studio guy.

319
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,230
Shh.

320
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,350
I love you.

321
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,260
I know.

322
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,170
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,840
Can we ...can we cut or something?

324
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,200
Uh, yeah.

325
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Cut.

326
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,380
Cut!

327
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,570
That's a cut!

328
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,400
Only I get to say "cut."

329
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,340
Hey, what's up?

330
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,200
I'm just a little upset.

331
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,850
With everything that's been
going on, who can blame you?

332
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,750
I just can't wrap my head
around the dialogue, you know?

333
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,970
"Salt" -- Doesn't
that sound silly?

334
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,480
I mean, why would a
ghost be afraid of salt?

335
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,100
Okay, um...

336
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,710
Marty, what do you think?

337
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,220
Not married to salt.

338
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,770
What do you want?

339
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,580
We still sticking with condiments?

340
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,540
Mmm, it just sounds
different, not better.

341
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,120
What else would a ghost be scared of?

342
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,880
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

343
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,400
What would a ghost be scared of?

344
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,160
Maybe shotguns.

345
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,620
That makes even less sense than salt.

346
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,370
These people are idiots.

347
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
Walter's a little testy for a P.A., Huh?

348
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,510
How's it going in here?

349
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,930
Really good -- Tara has stepped up her performance,
and I think it's from the sense-Memory stuff.

350
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,770
Sense-Memory?

351
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,890
Yeah.

352
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,730
Dean, you know, when I ask how it's going
here, I'm talking about the case, right?

353
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,330
We don't really work here.

354
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,240
You know, I thought
you hated being a P.A.

355
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,990
I don't know.

356
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,730
It's not so bad.

357
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,590
I kind of feel like part
of the team, you know?

358
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,420
It's good.

359
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,530
Oh, taquito?

360
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,700
They're wonderful.

361
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,530
No.

362
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,460
Um, listen.

363
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,030
I conned my way into the morgue.

364
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,990
News reports are right.

365
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,640
Brad's a doornail
-- No question.

366
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,670
Copy that.

367
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,410
Sorry.What?

368
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,270
"Copy that"?

369
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,040
What did you say?

370
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,170
The news reports are right.

371
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,010
Brad's a doornail.

372
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,920
They're aware.

373
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,840
Who's aware?

374
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,520
Sorry.

375
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,460
What were you saying?

376
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,440
Uh, uh, the newspaper's right.

377
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,390
Brad's a doornail.

378
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,330
No question about it.

379
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,090
I guess it's a good
thing we didn't skip town.

380
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,070
Oh, come here.

381
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,510
I want you to hear something.

382
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,430
Copy that.

383
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,710
On my way.

384
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,480
Hey, Dave.

385
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,540
Can you play that thing
you were playing me earlier?

386
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,910
Sure.

387
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,720
Thanks.

388
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,540
It doesn't matter.

389
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,840
We're not leaving till we
find Wendy and her sister.

390
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,090
Got it?

391
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,240
Good.

392
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,930
Now, let's get busy.

393
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,170
E.V.P.

394
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,880
From the night of Brad's stage dive.

395
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,030
All of a sudden, I'm getting
electromagnetic readings up the wazoo.

396
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,210
For some reason, it's
a legit haunting now.

397
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,980
Well, whose ghost, Dean?

398
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,710
What's it want?

399
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,300
I think we should take a
look at Brad's death scene.

400
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,550
Now, where'd you get this dvd?

401
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,090
They're called dailies.

402
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,270
I got it from cindy.

403
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,480
She's kind of got this
thing going with drew.

404
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,220
He dubbed me an extra copy.

405
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,950
All right.

406
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,650
Here's where the guy
fell through the roof.

407
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,170
Right.

408
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,140
All right, here we go.

409
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,940
They must have super hearing.

410
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Wait.

411
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,710
Go back, go back.

412
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,870
Right after -- Right
after -- Yeah, right.

413
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,940
Wait.

414
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,300
There.

415
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,160
It's like "3 men and
a baby" all over again.

416
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,260
Selleck, danson, and guttenberg,
and I don't know who played the baby.

417
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,390
What's your point?

418
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,980
There's a scene where people say that
the camera caught a ghost on film.

419
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,210
Apparently, in the background of one of the
scenes, there was this boy that nobody remembers.

420
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,130
Spirit photography.

421
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,830
I've seen her before.

422
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,960
Here.Check this out.

423
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,370
Yeah, go for ozzie.

424
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,170
No, I don't have a 20 on Tara.

425
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,160
I think she's 10-100.

426
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,800
Okay, copy that.

427
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,130
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,520
What were you saying?

429
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,370
Elise Drummond. Starlet
back in the '30s.

430
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,870
Had an affair with a studio exec.

431
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,410
He uses her up, fires
her, leaves her destitute.

432
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,410
Elise hangs herself from stage 9's rafters
right into a scene they're shooting.

433
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,900
Just like our man Brad.

434
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,840
So, what, she's got it
in for the studio brass?

435
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,970
Possibly.

436
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,420
I mean, it's a motive, and
Brad's death matches hers exactly.

437
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,490
We're digging tonight, aren't we?

438
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,090
That's a wrap, people!

439
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,170
6:00 A.M.Call for crew tomorrow.

440
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,390
Great work, everybody!

441
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,640
Mcg, you're a genius.

442
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,080
You're kickin' ass and taking names.

443
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,330
Good night, Jay.

444
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,400
Yeah.

445
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,410
Which way?

446
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,990
Over here.

447
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,730
Hey.

448
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah?

449
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,610
Hey, this map is totally
worth the 5 bucks.

450
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,010
Hey, we got to go check out Johnny
Ramone's grave when we're done here.

451
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,720
You want to dig him up, too?

452
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,080
Bite your tongue, heathen!

453
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,070
You know, Dean, what I
don't get is, why now?

454
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,800
I mean, after 75 years, Elise
Drummond suddenly goes homicidal.

455
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,910
You know, why this movie?

456
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,110
Well, maybe she's mad they're
making a scary ghost flick.

457
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,500
Is it really that scary?

458
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,550
Here we go.

459
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,700
Yahtzee.

460
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,140
I know.

461
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,330
No, I friggin' hate mcg's dailies.

462
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,690
I can't control the guy.

463
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,970
I'm telling you -- Next
one I'm directing myself.

464
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,910
What, you?

465
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,010
No, bob.

466
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,200
You I love.

467
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,180
You're a genius.

468
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,490
You're kicking ass and taking names.

469
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,060
Yeah, okay.

470
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,080
Yeah.

471
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,130
Talk to you later, babe.

472
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,410
Uh-Huh.

473
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,280
What a dick.

474
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,240
Oh, great.

475
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,660
Hey, guys!

476
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,620
Producer walking here!

477
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,350
Hello!

478
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,870
Hey!

479
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,080
Hey, pal.

480
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,190
Can you, uh, show me to the exit?

481
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,400
I can't see a damn thing here.

482
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,890
Hey!

483
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,170
Hey, putz.

484
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,550
I'm talking to you.

485
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,330
Somebody could get hurt here.

486
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,310
What the hell?

487
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,960
No!

488
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,850
No!

489
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,130
They never forgive.

490
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,410
They never forget.

491
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,650
Mitch?

492
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,940
Ashley?

493
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,850
This summer, they're coming
back again to settle the score...

494
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,350
Again.

495
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,290
You out here?

496
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,910
Ashley and Todd
-- They're dead!

497
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,060
Wendy, they're dead!

498
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,640
These bastards aren't taking
us, not without a fight.

499
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,150
I am getting out of here right now!

500
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,340
Brody!

501
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,080
From the makers of
"Cornfield Massacre"...

502
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,300
"Monster truck, " "Charlie's angels"...

503
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,760
"Charlie's Angels 2: Full throttle"...

504
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,190
And "Hell hazers" comes a
new experience in terror.

505
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,050
<i>We must have brought them
back ...back from hell. AGAIN</i>

506
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,090
<i>This film not yet rated</i>

507
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,970
Rolled in with a giant fan.

508
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,990
Same thing happened to an electrician
back in '66 -- A guy named Billy Beard.

509
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,320
What the hell, dude?

510
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,960
I don't know.

511
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,430
It doesn't seem like Elise this time.

512
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,240
We already torched her.

513
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,390
Are we dealing with another ghost?

514
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,060
Maybe.

515
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,050
Yeah, but these things
don't usually tag-Team.

516
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,210
Everybody!

517
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,800
Gather around, okay?

518
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,390
I got an announcement to make.

519
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,910
Hold that for me.

520
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,020
Everyone!

521
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,430
Huddle in!

522
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:13,880
In light of Jay's accident last night and in cooperation with
the authorities, we're shutting down production for a few days.

523
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,000
I know, I know.

524
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,820
Look, I'm not going to lie to you.

525
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,430
We've had a few setbacks this week.

526
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,750
But we all know what Jay and
Brad wanted more than anything.

527
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:31,380
And that was to see "Hell Hazers 2: The
Reckoning" on screens all across America.

528
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:38,230
Now, we owe it to them to go on and to
pull together and make this damn movie, huh?

529
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,600
But... but ... but ... but
...but not ... not today.

530
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,330
Go home.

531
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,090
Someone will call you.

532
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,360
Wendy.

533
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,740
What, are you afraid of ghosts?

534
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,470
Come on.

535
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,070
It'll be fun.

536
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,940
Hey.

537
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,160
Hey.

538
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,540
So, you find out where
the electrician's buried?

539
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,940
He wasn't.

540
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,600
Billy beard was cremated.

541
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,500
Great.

542
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,940
Now what?

543
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,280
No idea.

544
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,660
Anymore ghost cameos in the dailies?

545
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,090
Not in the first six hours.

546
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,960
You know.

547
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,110
Maybe the spirits are trying to shut
down the movie 'cause they think it sucks.

548
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,640
'Cause, I mean, it kind of does.

549
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,300
From, uh, "come on, it'll be fun"?

550
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,090
Come on.

551
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,450
It'll be fun.

552
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:48,600
Listen to the invocation.

553
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,310
Dean, that's the real deal a
necromantic summoning ritual.

554
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,100
What the hell is that
doing in a hollywood movie?

555
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,550
No, dear.

556
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,830
We're down for a few days.

557
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:05,490
It's cool, it gives me time to
pitch that time-Travel thing.

558
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,690
Yeah.

559
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,300
All right, well, look.

560
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,320
Get back to me on this, all right?

561
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,180
Seriously.

562
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,920
No, I'm serious.

563
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,020
Dude, are you serious?

564
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,420
'Cause I'm serious.

565
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,590
All right.

566
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,710
Cool.

567
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,930
Guys, we're all shut down.

568
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,070
What are you still doing here?

569
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,660
Yeah, uh...

570
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,580
Really sorry, man.

571
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,040
We -- We -- We
couldn't help ourselves.

572
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,840
We just had to tell you
that we read the script.

573
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,910
And?

574
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,100
Yeah.

575
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
It's, uh...

576
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,300
It's awesome.

577
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,500
Awesome.

578
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,640
Really awesome.

579
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,050
I know.

580
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,200
It's pretty rockin', right?

581
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,340
I'm glad you guys liked it.

582
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:38,940
Yeah.

583
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,740
I-I really liked all
the attention to detail.

584
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,250
Dude, right on.

585
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,770
That's my thing.

586
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,060
I mean, you know, color
me guilty, but that is me.

587
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,830
I'm a total detail buff.

588
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,670
No, I mean, the way you worked in all those Enochian
summoning rituals and all the authentic language and...

589
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,750
What, you mean that latin crap?

590
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,480
No, man.

591
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,670
That's Walter.

592
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,790
Walter Dixon, the original writer.

593
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,320
You like that garbage?

594
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,880
Wait, Walter --
The P.A.Walter?

595
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,920
No, he's not a P.A.

596
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,860
He's got a clause in his contract
that allows him to come on set.

597
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,410
But he wrote the invocations?

598
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,120
He wrote a wackjob screenplay.

599
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,790
There's no pace.

600
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,890
There's no love interest.

601
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,390
It's all wackadoo exposition.

602
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,570
I had to cut, like, 90% of it to make
it readable, another 10% to make it good.

603
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,850
Should have kept
Walter's original script.

604
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,110
It's actually pretty good.

605
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,720
Yeah.

606
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,770
And it reads like a how-To
manual of conjuration,

607
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,720
Like a textbook on how to summon ghosts
and get them to do whatever you want.

608
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,940
Yeah, like kill people.

609
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,270
Yep.

610
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,510
So let's say somewhere down the line,
Walter learned some pretty black magic.

611
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,120
Yeah, and let's say he's pissed at
these people for wrecking his movie.

612
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,500
Motive and means.

613
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,680
It's worth checking out.

614
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,490
So?

615
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,190
You wanted to meet?

616
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,300
Hey, I'm a little busy here, buddy.

617
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,570
I'm working on a script.

618
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,070
Oh, yeah.

619
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,820
You guys worked on it a lot.

620
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,360
It needed work.

621
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,130
Now, why couldn't we have
done this in my office?

622
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:19,080
You know, the history, the lore in
my draft was completely accurate.

623
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,900
We could have gotten it right for the first time ever
in this whorehouse of a town, but you tore it to shreds.

624
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,020
You replaced it with
cleavage and fart jokes.

625
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,680
It was real.

626
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,110
Who gives a rat's ass about real?

627
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,420
We're talking about ghosts here, Walter.

628
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,350
There's no such thing.

629
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,380
That's where you're wrong, martin.

630
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,560
Okay, nutjob...

631
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,860
End of meeting.

632
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,950
C oh, my god, no!

633
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,500
Please, no!

634
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,250
You ruined it, martin!

635
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,850
Everything I worked for!

636
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,040
Oh, god!

637
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,080
Walter!

638
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,660
Now you're gonna find out
what being a ghost is like!

639
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,160
Walter, please!

640
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,180
Walter, help me!

641
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,030
Help!

642
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,890
You are one hell of a P.A.

643
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,440
Yeah, I know.

644
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,060
What are you doing?

645
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,930
Could ask you the same thing, Walter.

646
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,490
Raising these spirits from the dead?

647
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,800
Making them murder for you?

648
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,730
That's playing with fire, Walter.

649
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,530
You don't understand.

650
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,070
You know what?

651
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,550
You're right.

652
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,950
I don't understand.

653
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,100
Wait, look.

654
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,710
You put your heart and soul into
something, years of hard work ... years.

655
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,330
And then they take it,
and they crap all over it!

656
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,550
And then -- And then they want
you to smile and say thank you.

657
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,170
Walter, listen.

658
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,000
It's just a movie.

659
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,170
That's it.

660
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,660
Look.

661
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,070
I got nothing against you, man.

662
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,000
You're not part of this.

663
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,290
Just please --
Please, just leave.

664
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,320
But martin's got to stay.

665
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,900
Sorry, can't do that.

666
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,500
It's not that we like him or anything.

667
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,830
It's a matter of principle.

668
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,520
Then I'm sorry, too.

669
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,520
Walter.

670
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,670
Walter,
pl-- Don't.

671
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,410
Sam!

672
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,750
Come on.

673
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,060
Come on.

674
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,080
Come out to the coast.

675
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,500
We'll get together, have a few laughs.

676
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh, man!

677
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,520
I can't frickin' believe this.

678
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,530
Ghosts are real.

679
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,870
What makes you say that?

680
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,320
But I don't understand.

681
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,510
How is Walter controlling them?

682
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,310
Probably that talisman.

683
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,430
What are you doing?

684
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,180
If film cameras pick
these suckers up, then...

685
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,980
Maybe, uh...

686
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,710
Dean, right there!

687
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,650
Hey!

688
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,920
Right there!

689
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,770
Here.

690
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,400
Get the idea?

691
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,870
Yeah.

692
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,720
All right, you hold them off.

693
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,210
I'm going after Walter.

694
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,980
I cannot believe there's an afterlife.

695
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,720
There's an afterlife, all right.

696
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,750
But mostly it's a pain in the ass.

697
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,470
There!

698
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,790
It's over, Walter.

699
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,480
TherE.

700
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,310
Okay, now no one can have it.

701
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,610
I wouldn't have done that if I were you.

702
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,860
Yeah?

703
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,930
Why not?

704
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,510
'Cause you just freed them.

705
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,100
We can't stop them now.

706
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,260
Walter, you brought them back...

707
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,420
Forced them to murder.

708
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,760
They're not going to
be very happy with you.

709
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,090
Yeah?

710
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,480
So, why not?

711
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,510
Oh, god.

712
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,620
There!

713
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,290
But I don't understand.

714
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,630
How come the spirits
appear in the camera phone?

715
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,600
The video must pick up their
frequencies in a way that our eyes can't.

716
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,730
Oh, God.

717
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,900
Right there!

718
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,190
Cut!

719
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,760
Oh, print that one.

720
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,990
That's in the movie.

721
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,630
Oh!

722
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,220
Loved it, kids,  loved it!

723
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,920
You find out there's an afterlife,
and this is what you do with it?

724
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,870
<i>I needed a little jazz on the page.</i>

725
