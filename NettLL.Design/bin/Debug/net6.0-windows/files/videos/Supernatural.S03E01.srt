look,dad's gone now.

00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,360
we have to carry out his legacy,

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,760
and that means hunting down
as many evil sons of bitches

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,430
as we possibly can.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,730
whoops.

6
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,130
let me guess -- you're
offering up your own soul?

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,530
all you got to do
is bring sam back.

8
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,800
i'll give you one year
and one year only.

00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,760

out,then the deal is off.

just happened?

sam,you want to break dean free
of that demon deal,

22
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,060
you ain't gonna find the answer
in no book.

23
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,360
then where,bobby?

well,you boys better
pack it up.

28
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,430

found something.

with big brown eyes *

and he thinks that maybe we --

33
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,830
oh,god.

34
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,860

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,160
what for?

36
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,900
so i can gouge my eyes out.

37
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,300
it was a beautiful,
natural act,sam.

38
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,160
it's a part of you i never
wanted to see,dean.

39
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,730
hey,i appreciate you giving me
a little quality time

with the doublemint twins.

41
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,360
no problem.

42
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,760
really?

43
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,260
well,i got to say,

44
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,730
i was expecting a weary sigh
or an eye roll,something.

45
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
not at all. you deserve
to have a little fun.

46

with you there.

what's bobby got?
not much.

48
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,730
crop failure and a cicada swarm
outside of lincoln,nebraska.

49
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,430
could be demonic omens.

50
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,230
or could just be a bad crop
and a bug problem.
but it's our only lead.

51
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,160
any freaky deaths?
nothing bobby could find --
not yet,anyway.

52
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,360
it's weird,man. the night
the devil's gate opened,

you think it would be
"apocalypse now,"

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,760
but it's been five days
and bubkes.

58
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,900
what are the demons
waiting for?

59
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,530

start already.

00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,500

palo santo?

101
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,760
it's holy wood from peru.

102
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,460
it's toxic to demons
like holy water.

103
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,130
keeps the bastards nailed down
while you're exorcising them.

104

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,200
i just spoke
to the suspect.

178
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,930
yeah? so,what do you think?
is she possessed or what?

179
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,160
don't think so.

180
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,960
there's none
of the usual signs --

181
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,630
no blackouts,
no loss of control.

182
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,130
totally lucid.

183
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,860
<i>just,she really wanted
those shoes.</i>

184
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,000
spilled a glass of holy water
on her just to be sure.

185
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,630
nothing.

186
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,630
maybe she's just some
random wack job.

187
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,860
if it had been an isolated
incident,maybe,

188
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,560
but first the family,
now this?

189
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,230
i believe
in a lot of things.

190
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,730
coincidence
ain't one of them.

191
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,100
did you boys find anything
around here?

192
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,430
no sulfur,nothing.

193
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,660
well,maybe something.

194
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,660
see? i'm working.

195
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,730
anything interesting?

196
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,060
i don't know yet.

197
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,800
might just be a guy...

198
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,900
or it might be our guy.

199
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,300
what time is it?

200
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,260
seven past midnight.

201
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,900
you sure this is
the right place?
no.

202
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,400
but i spent all day canvassing
this stupid town

203
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,660
with this guy's stupid mug,

204
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,130
and,supposedly,
he drinks at this stupid bar.

205
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,330
that's not funny!

206
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,500
yeah.
uh,all right,so --

207
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,430
so,john doe's name
is walter rosen.

208
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,360
he's from oak park,
just west of chicago.

209
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,900
went missing
about a week ago.

210
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,130
the night
the devil's gate opened?
yeah.

211
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
so you think
he's possessed?
it's a good bet.

212
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,700
so,what,he just walks up
to someone,touches them,

213
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,400
and they go
stark raving psycho?

214
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,060
those demons that got out
at the gate --

215
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,360
they're gonna do all kinds
of things we haven't seen.

216
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,960
<i>you mean the demons
we let out?</i>

217
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
guys.

218
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,060
all right. showtime.

219
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,460
wait a minute.
what?

220
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,600
what did i just say?

221
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,960
we don't know what to expect
out of this guy.

222
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,230
we should tail him
till we know for sure.

223
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,400
oh,so he kills someone
and we just sit here?

224
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,100
we're no good dead!

225
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,100
and we're not gonna make
a move

226
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,700
until we know
what the score is.

227
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,030
hey,bobby,i don't think
that's an option.

228
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,160
why not?

229
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,160
damn it!

230
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,860
thanks.

231
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,030
you're welcome.

232
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,900
pull the car in back.

233
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,600
we'll be right out.

234
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,830
i love you.

what do you think
you're doing?

237
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,100
i'm just hitting the head.

238
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,360
no.

239
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,730
<i>i mean,what do you think
you're doing here?</i>

240
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,400
i don't like hunters
in my bar.

241
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,360
<i>man,you really walked
into the wrong place.</i>

242
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,880
hold on.
i like the girl.

243
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,280
<i>wish i had me a girl
like that.</i>

244
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,610
i can think of about a thousand
things i'd like to do to her.

245
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,250
you're not gonna lay
one filthy finger on her!

246
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,780
i got something for you.

263
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,910
i left my husband bloody
on the floor!

264
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,280
okay,i understand that,
but we can't go back.

265
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,780
fine. then you stay.

266
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,310
but i'm heading back
to that bar.

267
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,650
i'll go with her.

268
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,810
it's suicide,dean!

269
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,480
so what?
i'm dead already!

270
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,380
how you gonna kill 'em?
can't shoot 'em.

271
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,680
you can't stab 'em.

272
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,910
they're not just gonna wait
in line to get exorcised!

273
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,150
i don't care!

274
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,510
we don't even know how many
of them there are!

275
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,610
yeah,we do.
there's seven.

276
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,150
do you have any idea
who we're up against?

277
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,580
no. who?

278
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,580
the seven deadly sins,
live and in the flesh!

what's this?

282
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,650
"binsfeld's classification
of demons."

283
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,410
in 1589,binsfeld
i.d.'d the seven sins --

284
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,950
not just as human vices
but as actual devils.

285
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,080
the family --
they were touched by sloth.

286
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,380
and the shopper...

287
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,710
that's envy's doing --

288
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,980
the customer we got
in the next room.

289
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,580
i couldn't suss it out at first
until isaac.

290
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,810
he was touched
with an awful gluttony.

291
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,180
i don't give a rat's ass

292
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,580
if they're the three stooges
or the four tops!

293
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,610
i'm gonna slaughter
every last one of them!

294
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,580
<i>we already did it your way.</i>

295
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,850
you burst in there half-cocked
and look what happened!

296
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,480
these demons haven't been
topside in half a millennium!

297
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,810
we're talking medieval,
dark ages!

298
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,510
we've never faced anything
close to this!

299
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,750
so we are gonna
take a breath...

300
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,580
and figure out
what our next move is!

301
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,610
i am sorry for your loss.

302
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,310
so you know who i am,huh?

303
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,810
we do.
we're not impressed.

304
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,250
why are you here?
what are you after?

305
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,310
he asked you a question.

306
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,310
what do you want?

307
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,080
ya! ohh!

308
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,110
we already have...

309
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,580
what we want.

310
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,880
what's that?

311
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,450
we're out.

312
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,050
we're free.

313
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,710
thanks to you,
my kind are everywhere.

314
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,680
i am legion,
for we are many.

315
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,610
so me,
i'm just celebrating.

316
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,710
having a little fun.

317
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,650
fun?

318
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,280
yeah. fun.

319
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,210

others golf.

320
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,780
me?

321
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,680
i like to see
people's insides...

322
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,210
on their outside.

323
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,650
i'm gonna put you down
like a dog.

324
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,050
please.

326
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,010
you really think
you're better than me.

328
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,810
which one of you can cast
the first stone,huh?

329
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
what about you,dean?

330
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,810
you're practically
a walking billboard

331
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,050
of gluttony and lust.

332
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,480
and,tamara,
all that wrath.

333
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,050
ooh. tsk,tsk,tsk,
tsk,tsk,tsk,tsk.

334
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,210
it's the reason you and isaac
became hunters

335
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,780
in the first place,
isn't it?

336
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:09,780
it's so much easier
to drink in the rage

337
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:13,750
than to face what really
happened all those years ago.

338
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,110
aah!

339
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,150

341
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,650
my point exactly.

342
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,350
<i>and you call us sins.</i>

343
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,180
we're not sins,man.

344
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,380
we are natural
human instinct.

345
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,480
and you can repress and deny us
all you want,

346
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,780
but the truth is,
you are just animals.

347
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,580
horny...

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,480

...violent animals.

351
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,150
and you know what?

352
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,810
you'll be slaughtered
like animals,too.

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,980
the others --

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,650
they're coming for me.

355
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,510
maybe.

356
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,010
but they're not
gonna find you...

357
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,710
'cause you'll be in hell.

358
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,110
someone send
this clown packing.

359
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,010

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,880
i don't think we're gonna have
to worry about hunting them.

363
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,180
what does that mean?

364
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,280
i think maybe
this joker's right.

365
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,810
<i>they're gonna be
hunting us.</i>

366
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,850

quit easy.

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,380
you guys,
why don't you take tamara

368
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,750
and head for the hills?

369
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,150

you're insane,dean.

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,550
sam's rit.

373
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,450
there's six of them,guys.

we're outmanned,
we're outgunned.

we'll be dead by dawn.

376
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,780
maybe,but there's no place
to run that they won't find us.

377
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,050
look,if we're going down,

378
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,880
we're going down together,
all right?

379

for them.

and the guy?

382
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,780
he didn't make it.

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,510
it's not him.
it's one of those demons.

392
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,550
it's possessing his corpse.

394
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,480
why won't you let me in?

395
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,110
you left me behind
back there.

396
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,980
how could you do that?

397
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,980
we swore...

398
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,150
at that lake in michigan.

399
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,550
remember?

400
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,910
we swore we would never
leave each other!

401
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,050
how did he know that?

402
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,150
steady,tamara.

403
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,810

let me die?!

405
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,610
i guess that's what
you do,dear!

406
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,280
like that night those things
came to our house...

407
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,550
...came for our daughter!

the root of all sin.

and you...

429
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,610
are sam winchester.

430
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,780
that's right.
i've heard of you.

looking at you now,
i got to tell you,

434
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,210
don't believe the hype.

435
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,050

00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,210
i guess i don't really have
to do a damn thing,now,do i?

440
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,480
you're fair game now,boy,
and it's open season.

sam: think she's gonna be
all right?

00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,430
no. definitely not.

<i>well,you look like hell
warmed over.</i>

450
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,300
you try exorcising all night
and see how you feel.

451
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,060
any survivors,bobby?

452
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,030
well,the pretty girl
and the heavy guy,

453
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,300
they'll make it.

lifetime of therapy bills
ahead,but,still...

455
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,500
that's more than you can say
for these poor bastards.

456
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,660
bobby,that knife --

457
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,460
what kind of blade
can kill a demon?

458
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,100
yesterday,i would have said
there was no such thing.

459
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,130
i'm just gonna ask it again --
who was that masked chick?

460
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,960
actually,the more troubling
question would be,

461
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,060
"how come a girl can fight
better than you?"

462
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,500
three demons,dean...
at once.

you through the night,pal.

a troubling question,

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,130
i got one for you --

466
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,800
if we let out
the seven deadly sins,

467
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,130
what else did we let out?

468
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,200
<i>you're right.
that is troubling.</i>

00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,730

this hoodoo priestess

be able to help us out,

with your demon deal.

yes,we do.

and you act like
you couldn't care less.

what,you got some kind of
death wish or something?

please,tell me.

there's no way out of it.

how could you make
that deal,dean?

516

'cause i couldn't live
with you dead.

517
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,160
couldn't do it.

518
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,400
so,what,
now i live and you die?

519
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,760
that's the general idea,
yeah.

520
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,330
yeah,well,
you're a hypocrite,dean.

521
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,400
how did you feel when dad
sold his soul for you?

522
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,200
'cause i was there.
i remember.

and now you go and do
the same thing...to me.

525
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,230

it was selfish.</i>
