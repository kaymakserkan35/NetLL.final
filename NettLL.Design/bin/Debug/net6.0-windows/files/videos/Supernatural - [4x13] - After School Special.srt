1
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:04,207
When I told dad I was scared of the thing in my closet,

2
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:05,581
He gave me a.45.

3
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:06,706
What was he supposed to do?

4
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:08,378
I was 9 years old.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,224
The weapon training and melting the silver into bullets?

6
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:14,728
Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors.

7
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:17,694
Lock the doors and windows, close the shades.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,995
And most important --

9
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:20,019
Watch out for Sammy.

10
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:25,483
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:26,924
It's called being a good son.

12
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:28,795
Dad's gonna be here, right?

13
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:30,838
He'll be here. Promise.

14
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:32,610
Where is he, anyway? On business.

15
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:37,705
And that's why you ran away. I was just going to college.

16
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:40,117
It was dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone.

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,483
Your brother and me -- We needed you.

18
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:44,432
You walked away, Sam.

19
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:46,427
<i>You walked away! Stop it, both of you.</i>

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,778
You're the one who said, "don't come back," dad.

21
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,911
You're the one who closed that door, not me!

22
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:51,861
This is never the life that I wanted for you.

23
00:00:52,788 --> 00:00:53,670
Aah!

24
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,401
Look, I'm sure dad would have been here if he could.

25
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:05,737
She's such a slut.

26
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:07,375
So?

27
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,602
Personally, I'm very pro-Slut.

28
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:13,031
What happened, anyway?

29
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:16,011
She totally banged jamie jaffe, that's what.

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,098
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.

31
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:21,804
Hi, taylor. How was your weekend?

32
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,012
Fine, I guess.

33
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:25,841
You didn't... go to the rodeo?

34
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:28,577
That's my spot.

35
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:31,358
Sorry. This is a skeev-Free zone.

36
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,074
Slut!

37
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:37,624
Slut! Slut!

38
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:43,442
Slut! Slut!

39
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:57,728
You shouldn't listen to those jerks.

40
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,215
Leave me alone.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,895
I just mean...

42
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,353
I'm sorry, that's all.

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,319
You?

44
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:07,666
You're sorry?

45
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,467
Don't you feel sorry for me, you fat, ugly pig.

46
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:43,924
You think I'm ugly?

47
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,889
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

48
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:48,616
I didn't mean it, okay?

49
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:58,440
Aah! Aah!

50
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,527
I'm not ugly.

51
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,358
<i>You're ugly.</i>

52
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:56,760
www.1000fr.com

53
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,753
www.1000fr.com

54
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:09,286
supernatural 413

55
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,788
I'm not talking about it anymore.

56
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:15,430
I already told the cops and the doctors.

57
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,316
No one believes me.

58
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:18,544
They think I'm crazy.

59
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:21,149
Well, I'm a little bit more open-Minded than most.

60
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:25,549
April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?

61
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:27,035
It doesn't matter.

62
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:28,245
It matters to me.

63
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:36,865
When I --

64
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:40,942
When I hurt taylor, I was there, in my head,

65
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:43,862
But I couldn't control my body.

66
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:50,621
I could see what I was doing, but I couldn't stop.

67
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:54,236
I just wanted to stop.

68
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,570
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:58,653
You needn't to apologize

70
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,620
April, some of the kids at school told the police

71
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,292
That you and taylor didn't get along.

72
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,425
Well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her.

73
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,004
Never.

74
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:10,604
Do you believe me?

75
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:12,920
Yeah, I do.

76
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:17,043
Just a couple more questions.

77
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,001
On the day this happened, did you...

78
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:20,489
Happen to smell anything?

79
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,016
Anything...

80
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,040
Like what?

81
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:28,533
Like rotten eggs or... sulfur?

82
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,157
Um, no.

83
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:31,690
Okay.

84
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:38,799
What are you, crazy?

85
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,492
So?

86
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:57,133
I think she's telling the truth.

87
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,229
I mean, the way she talked about being there mentally

88
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,254
But not physically --

89
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,266
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.

90
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:04,336
Kind of?

91
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:07,072
She didn't see any black smoke or smell sulfur.

92
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,759
Maybe it's not a demon. I mean, kids can be vicious.

93
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:11,246
Well, I mean, we're already here.

94
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,225
Might as well check out the school.

95
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:15,469
Right. The school.

96
00:06:16,682 --> 00:06:17,335
What?

97
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:19,343
Truman high, home of the bombers.

98
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:21,613
What's your point?

99
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,312
I don't know.

100
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:23,521
I mean, we went there, like...

101
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,929
For a month a million years ago.

102
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,740
Why are you so jazzed to go back? I'm not.

103
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,411
I just think it's worth looking into.

104
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,130
All right, well, what's our cover?

105
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:31,338
Fbi? Homeland security?

106
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,286
Swedish exchange students?

107
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:33,991
Don't worry.

108
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,781
I got an idea.

109
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:39,747
Okay.

110
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:52,665
Long, Long Way From Home (Foreigner) 

111
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:11,841
Thanks, dad.

112
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:14,827
Got your lunch?

113
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,515
Books? Butterfly knife?

114
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:18,031
Yeah, Dean.

115
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,844
You okay? Sure.

116
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:20,821
Sammy...

117
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,018
I mean, look,

118
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:26,292
This is the third school we've been to this year,

119
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:27,326
And it's only november.

120
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:29,738
I'm just sick of always being the new kid.

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,624
You'll be fine.

122
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,584
If anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know.

123
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,769
Relax. Dad said this hunt will take him two weeks, tops.

124
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,680
As soon as he gets back, we're out of here.

125
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,259
To another school.

126
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,394
Awesome.

127
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:51,444
Ladies and gentlemen,

128
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,485
Please say hello to Sam winchester.

129
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:55,663
Hi, Sam.Hi, Sam. Hi, Sam.Hi, Sam.

130
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,205
Class, say hello to our new student, Dean winchester.

131
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:03,630
Dean, is there anything

132
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,117
You'd like to tell us about yourself?

133
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,482
Not really, sweetheart.

134
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,061
Take your seat.

135
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:11,472
Is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?

136
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:13,928
Not really.

137
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,970
Okay. Uh, grab a seat.

138
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,927
Whoa, that's yours?

139
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:38,819
Awesome!

140
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:43,552
Dean, where are your books?

141
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:45,555
Don't need 'em, sugar.

142
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,272
Not gonna be here long enough anyway.

143
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:54,768
All right, gang...

144
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:57,273
Essay assignment.

145
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:58,943
Aw!Aw! Aw!Aw!

146
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,863
Yeah, yeah, my heart breaks for you.

147
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:04,275
Hey...

148
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:06,407
I'm barry.

149
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,033
Sam.

150
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:08,970
Okay, now, I want three pages

151
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,490
Of your most memorable family experience.

152
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:15,695
Okay?

153
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,413
So, three pages. Leave him alone.

154
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:20,104
Shh, I'm going for a record.

155
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,733
Most memorable family experience, so...

156
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,007
I said, "leave him alone."

157
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,554
...summer camp, um...

158
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,260
A hawaiian vacation... you want to take his place...midget?

159
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:34,616
Yeah. Sure.

160
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:40,976
But three pages, and it can be double-Spaced.

161
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:01,873
Today, you will have the honor

162
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,023
Of playing one of the greatest games ever invented.

163
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:09,099
A game of skill, agility, cunning.

164
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:12,264
A game with one simple rule...

165
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:17,646
...dodge.

166
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:19,602
Ugh!

167
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:22,348
Sorry.

168
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:25,219
Uh, substitute coach roth...

169
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:26,613
Yes?

170
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,447
Ms. Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.

171
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:32,515
Well, ms. B's in massachusetts getting married,

172
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:33,910
So we're playing.

173
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:34,934
She says it's dangerous.

174
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:36,476
Take a lap!

175
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,268
But --

176
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:45,897
Go nuts.

177
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:52,704
Having fun?

178
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,340
The whistle makes me their god.

179
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,521
Right. Nice shorts.

180
00:10:58,495 --> 00:10:59,239
Find anything?

181
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,979
I've been over the entire school twice.

182
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:02,823
No sulfur.

183
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,795
No sulfur, no demon. No demon, no case.

184
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:07,466
I don't know. Maybe I was wrong.

185
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,239
Well, it happens to the best of us.

186
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:10,170
I say we hit the road, huh?

187
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:12,350
But after lunc it's sloppy-Joday.

188
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:13,419
Ohh!

189
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:15,049
Ohh.

190
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:19,769
Good hustle, colby! Walk it off!

191
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:35,629
Hey, I need to copy your algebra homework again.

192
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:38,363
Hey!

193
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:41,653
Why?

194
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:44,341
'Cause you're a stupid, brain-Dead dick?

195
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:52,667
I'm gonna shove my fist down your throat, you little freak.

196
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,446
That fist? Yeah.

197
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:04,210
Aah!

198
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:21,896
What happened?

199
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,774
How's the nonviolence assembly going?

200
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,563
Apparently, shoving a kid's arm into a cuisinart

201
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:42,680
Is not a "healthy display of anger."

202
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:45,283
So, the kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear?

203
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,426
Which only comes from a seriously pissed-Off spirit.

204
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:49,236
It's got to be ghost possession.

205
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:50,965
Yeah, but that's pretty rare.

206
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:51,850
Yeah, but it happens.

207
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,484
I mean, they get angry enough,

208
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,064
They can take control of a person's body.

209
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:56,792
All right, so, what, we got a ghost in the building?

210
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,711
Yeah, but where? I mean, there's no emf.

211
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,213
Maybe we could find out who it is, at least.

212
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:04,313
You know, check and see if somebody died bloody around here or something.

213
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:05,336
Way ahead of you.

214
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,794
I had to break into the principal's office

215
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:08,586
To get this.

216
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,349
Oh, and fyi,

217
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:12,620
Three of the cheerleaders are legal.

218
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:13,599
Guess which ones.

219
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:14,761
No.

220
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,578
So, there was only one death on campus.

221
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,156
It was a suicide back in '98.

222
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:22,237
Some kid named barry cook.

223
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,303
What?

224
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:28,227
I knew him.

225
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:29,446
How did he die?

226
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,165
He slit his wrists

227
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,696
In the first-Floor girls' bathroom.

228
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:35,310
That's where --

229
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,350
Right where the chick got swirleyed to death. Exactly.

230
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,160
So, what? This ghost is possessing nerds?

231
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:43,478
And using them to go after bullies, yeah.

232
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,750
Well, does that sound like barry's m.O.?

233
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,084
Barry had a hard time.

234
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:01,448
Aah!

235
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:07,325
Thanks, Sam. Great school.

236
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:08,441
I don't care.

237
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:09,937
Three years, and I'm out of here.

238
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:11,332
I'm going to michigan state.

239
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,278
They got the best vet program in the country.

240
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:14,811
Do you like animals?

241
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:17,545
They're a lot nicer than people.

242
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,645
So tonight I'm thinking you, me,

243
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,688
A bucket of popcorn, extra butter...

244
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,215
Mm, kinky.

245
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:43,558
...and the midnight screening

246
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:45,840
Of "I spit on your grave" at the cinedome.

247
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:48,576
I can't.

248
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:52,190
I have a curfew... at 11:00.

249
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:53,951
So?

250
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,954
So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month.

251
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:01,364
Yeah, parents. Terrifying. Mm-Hmm.

252
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:02,715
Well, when's your curfew?

253
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:04,243
I don't have one.

254
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:13,770
Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?

255
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:16,182
My dad's out of town on a job.

256
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,806
It's just me and my brother.

257
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:19,384
For how long?

258
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:21,840
Couple of weeks.

259
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:25,129
Seriously?

260
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:28,927
Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at the pines.

261
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,953
The motel?

262
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:33,931
Mm-Hmm.

263
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:37,359
Hbo, magic fingers, free ice -- It's great.

264
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:40,833
Yeah...I guess.

265
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,752
What? I do whatever I want, whenever I want.

266
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:44,498
It's perfect.

267
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,693
Yeah, but...

268
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:50,889
Don't you miss your dad?

269
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:03,093
Yo! Sammy!

270
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:05,687
That's your brother with amanda heckerling?

271
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,199
He's cool.

272
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,101
<i>Yeah. He thinks so.</i>

273
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:13,352
Hey, tough guy.

274
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:15,114
I been looking for you.

275
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:17,622
Still want to take barry's place?

276
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:20,261
Get out of here, barry. I'll go get a teacher.

277
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:22,670
You want to go?

278
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:23,969
I'm not gonna fight you, dirk.

279
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:25,556
Why not? You chicken?

280
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:28,671
Come on!

281
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:29,510
No.

282
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:34,694
Get up! Get up!

283
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,642
Come on! Get up! Hey, get back!

284
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:37,527
Get back.

285
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,799
That is enough.

286
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,549
So long, barry cook.

287
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:31,161
U all right?

288
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:35,050
Barry was my friend.

289
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,276
I just burned his bones.

290
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:41,303
Well, he's at peace now, Sam.

291
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:45,193
I mean, if dad had let us stay just a little while longer,

292
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:46,956
Maybe uld have helped the kid, you know?

293
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:49,412
You read the coroner's report same as me.

294
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:51,867
Barry was on every anxiety drug

295
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,244
And antidepressant known to man.

296
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,829
School was hell for that kid.

297
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:59,720
His parents had split up. He just wanted out.

298
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:03,195
It was tragic, but it's not your fault.

299
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:07,035
To tell you the truth,

300
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,352
I'm glad we got out of that town.

301
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,424
I hated that school.

302
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,053
It wasn't all bad.

303
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,109
How can you say that after what happened to you?

304
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:27,775
That kid's dead. Dean.

305
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,631
I'm gonna rip his lungs out!

306
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,132
It's not a big deal. Not a big deal?

307
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,496
Sammy, look at yourself. If dad was here --

308
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:35,150
He's not.

309
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:36,174
Well, I am!

310
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:38,030
And as soo I'm finished with that dick --

311
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:39,010
Hmshut up, okay?!

312
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:43,196
I don't need your help.

313
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,207
<i>That's right, you don't. You could have torn him apart.</i>

314
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,054
So why didn't you?

315
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:50,251
Because I don't want to be the freak for once, Dean.

316
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,030
I want to be normal.

317
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,441
So taking a beating -- That's normal?

318
00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:59,157
Any word from dad?

319
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:03,558
He called this morning,

320
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,737
Said he's going to be another week at least.
We weren't supposed to be here this long.

321
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:11,273
At least you've got amanda.

322
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,314
She's cool

323
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,620
Dude, she wants me she's to meet her parents.

324
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,708
I don't do parents.

325
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,302
Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?

326
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:41,965
Um...

327
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:44,144
I'll wait for you outside.

328
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:50,157
Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it.

329
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,429
Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam.

330
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,628
You know this assignment was nonfiction, right?

331
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:00,852


333
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,300
So you and your family killed
a werewolf last summer, huh?

334
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,500
Why would you write
something like this, sam?

335
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
It doesn't matter.

336
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,600
As soon as my dad gets back,
we're leaving.

337
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,900
So you can flunk me
if you want to.

338
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,100
I'm not flunking you.
I'm giving you an "a."

339
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,000
Now,
aside from the werewolf,

340
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,800
Is that really how
you'd describe your family?

341
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah

342
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,100
Well, your brother
is quite a character.

343
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,300
And your father --
He seems, uh, driven.

344
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,600
Anyway, it's good, sam.It's really good.

345
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Have you ever thought
about pursuing writing?

346
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,800
I can't.

347
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,700
I have to go
into the family business.

348
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,500
Family business?

349
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,500
Yeah, my my dad is a --

350
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,000
My dad's a mechanic.

351
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,600
So i have to
be a mechanic, too.

352
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Do you want to go in
the family business, sam?

353
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,700
No one's ever
asked me that before.

354
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Well?

355
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,100
More than anything,no..

356
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Well...

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,600
i don't want to overstep
my bounds here, but...

358
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,900
...you don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

359
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Look, i mean,
i know what it's like.

360
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,500
I come from a family of
surgeons, and that wasn't me.

361
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,200
So, you know, i traded in the money and prestige
of being a doctor

362
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,900
For all the glamour
you see around you.

363
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
But the point is...

364
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,000
there may be three
or four big choices

365
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,300
That shape
someone's whole life,

366
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,000
And you need to be the one
that makes them,

367
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,600
Not anyone else.

368
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,100
You seem like
a great kid, sam.

369
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,900
Just live the life
you want to live.

370
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
We came back here so you could
talk to a teacher?

371
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,200
He's a good guy.

372
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,300
Well, whatever.

373
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,000
Go have your robin williams

374
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,700
"O captain!
My captain!" Moment. Just make it quick.

375
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,700
Excuse me, sir

376
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,100
You tell me
find room 305?

377
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,000
Sure. Um...

378
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,500
head down the hall,take your first right,
and it's the third door on the left.

379
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,600
Thanks, sam.

380
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
You got tall, winchester.

381
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,100
Trust me.
This will help.

382
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,300
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!

383
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,500
Well, you know what i mean.

384
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,600
It knew my name, dean.

385
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,000
My real name.

386
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We burned barry's bones.

387
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,400
What the hell?

388
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Well, maybe it wasn't barry.
Maybe we missed something.

389
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
We just got to go back.

390
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,000
No way.

391
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
How did we not
see this befe?

392
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,300
- What?
- Check it

393
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,500
Look, martha dumptruck,

394
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,800
Revenge of the nerds,
and hello kitty --

395
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,400
They rode the same bus.

396
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,200
Okay, so maybe
the bus is haunted.

397
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,000
Well, that would explain why
there's no emf at the school,

398
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,800
But not the attacks.

399
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,000
I mean, ghosts are tied
to the places that they haunt.

400
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,300
They can't just bail.

401
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,900
Unless this one can.

402
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,100
Dean, there's lore about
spirits possessing people and riding them for miles.

403
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,200
Then whenever
they leave the body,

404
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
They're bungeed
back to their usual haunt.

405
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,300
But until then, the ghosts
can go wherever they want.

406
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,000
So a spook just grabs
a kid on the bus

407
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,300
And walks
right into truman?

408
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,900
It's possible.

409
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,100
Ghosts getting creative --
Well, that's super.

410
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,400
Definitely ain't clean.

411
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,200
Here, ghosty,
ghosty, ghosty!

412
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,000
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

413
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,100
Man, i don't get it.

414
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,300
No one ever died
on this bus,

415
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,400
And it's not like there's
a body hidden in here.

416
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Yeah, but a flap of skin, a
hair, i mean, hell, a hangnail,

417
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,000
Something's got to be tying
the ghost to this place.

418
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,300
We just got to find it.

419
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Yeah.

420
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,100
Got a new driving permit.

421
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,900
Issued two weeks ago.

422
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,900
- Just before the first attack.
- Yeah.

423
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,700
Name of the bus driver
is dirk mcgregor sr.

424
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,900
39 north central avenue.

425
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,500
- Mcgregor?
- Yeah.

426
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,600
Why?

427
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,200
I knew his son.

428
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,200
Did you know everybody
at this school?

429
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,300
Got to watch where
you're going, man.

430
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,800
Leave him alone, dirk.

431
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,100
You never learn,
do you, midget?

432
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,900
Get to the bus, barry.

433
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,500
What's the matter?
You scared?

434
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,600
Don't worry.

435
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,500
I'll go easy on you
this time.

436
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,600
Come on, lose-Chester.
Let's see what you got.

437
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,200
Come on, freak!

438
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,800
Freak!

439
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,800
You're not tough.

440
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,200
You're just a jerk.

441
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,057
"Dirk the jerk."

442
00:27:22,104 --> 00:27:23,801
Dirk the jerk yeah thats pretty good

443
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:26,057
Dirk the jerk

444
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:35,593
Dirk the jerk.

445
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,200
So, you were
friends with dirk?

446
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
Yes, sir,
in high school.

447
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,900
I don't recall dirk having
many friends at truman.

448
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,100
Here, sit.
Sit down.

449
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,000
When did, uh --
When did dirk pass?

450
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,100
He was 18.

451
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,800
What happened to him?

452
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,400
Well, there was,
first, drinking,

453
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,600
Then drugs,
and then too many drugs.

454
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,800
And then he just
slipped through my fingers.

455
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,700
It was my fault.

456
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,900
I should have seen it coming,
you know?

457
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,000
Dirk, he, uh --
Well, he had his troubles.

458
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,700
What kind of troubles?

459
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,100
School was never easy
for dirk.

460
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,400
We didn't have much money,

461
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,300
And, well, you know, kids --
They can be cruel.

462
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,100
They picked on him.

463
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,300
They picked on him?

464
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,900
They called him poor
and dirty and stupid.

465
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,000
They even had
a nickname for him --

466
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,100
Dirk the jerk.

467
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,500
And after what happened
to his mother, he --

468
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,000
His mother?

469
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,900
Yeah, jane, my wife.

470
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,900
She died when dirk was 13.

471
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
Cancer.

472
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,300
I was working three,

473
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,000
So it fell to dirk
to take care of her.

474
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,800
And he was a great kid.

475
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
He made sure
jane got her medicine.

476
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,000
He helped her,
cleaned up after her.

477
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,500
But, you know, you --
You watch somebody die slow,

478
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,300
Waste away to nothing...

479
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,100
it does things to a person.

480
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Horrible things.

481
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,700
I didn't know
about his mother.

482
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,700
He -- He wouldn't
talk about her,

483
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,100
Not even to me.

484
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,300
Lot of anger in that boy.

485
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,400
Well, we'd really like to
pay our respects, mr. Mcgregor.

487
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,000
Um, you mind telling us
where dirk is buried?

488
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,800
Oh, he wasn't.
I had him cremated.

489
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,400
All of him?

490
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, i kept
a lock of his hair.

491
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,200
Oh, that's --
That's nice.

492
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,500
Where do you keep that?

493
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,100
On my bus, in my bible.

494
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,300
Thanks for subbing tonight,
eddie.

495
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,500
My pleasure, coach.

496
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,300
Eddie, you want to ease up
on the pedal, there?

497
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,300
I got it all
under control.

498
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,000
What the hell was that?

499
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,200
Everyone okay?

500
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,900
Dirk!

501
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,200
Winchester.

502
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,500
What are you gonna do,
shoot me?

503
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't need to.

504
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,400
That rope is soaked
in salt water, dirk.

505
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,900
You're not going anywhere.

506
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
All right, everybody stay where
you are. You'll be okay.

507
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,700
Aren't you
the p.E. Teacher?

508
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,700
Not really.
I'm like "21 jump street."

509
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,800
The bus driver sells pot.

510
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,700
Yeah.

511
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,900
It's not here!

512
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,400
Where is it?

513
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,200
No way
you'll ever find it.

514
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,700
Where is it?!

515
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,000
Sam winchester.

516
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
Still a bully.

517
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,600
You, you jocks...

518
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,500
you popular kids...

519
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,100
you always thought you were
better than everybody else.

520
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,700
And to you, i was just
dirk the jerk, right?

521
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,000
Now you evil sons of bitches are
gonna get what's coming to you.

522
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,300
I'm not evil, dirk.

523
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,100
I'm not.

524
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,500
And neither were you.

525
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,440
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.

526
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,800
We were scared
and miserable,

527
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,900
And we took it out
on each other --

528
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,400
Us and everybody else.

529
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,200
That's high school.

530
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,200
But you suffer through that,
and it gets better.

531
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,300
I'm just sorry you didn't
get a chance to see that...

532
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,400
You or Barry.

533
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,000
Nothing is gonna
get better for me.

534
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Not ever.

535
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,900
Dean! Find the hair!

536
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,400
Hey, buddy, this isn't
what it looks like

537
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,800
Little help?

538
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
He's giving you
the full cowgirl.

539
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,700
Five more minutes, jerry.

540
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,300
Amanda, hey!

541
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,300
Gettysburg address, 1863,
right?

542
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,700
History test next period.
We're studying.

543
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,600
Come on, baby.
She means nothing to me.Don't be mad.

544
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,400
I'm not mad, dean.

545
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,000
I thought maybe...

546
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
underneath your whole "i could
give a crap," bad-Boy thing,

547
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,800
That there was
something more going on.

548
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,900
I mean, like the way you are
with your brother.

549
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,700
But i was wrong.

550
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,500
And you spend so much time

551
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,800
Trying to convince people
that you're cool,

552
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,000
But it's just an act.

553
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
We both know that
you're just a sad...

554
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
lonely little kid.

555
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,100
And i feel sorry
for you, dean.

556
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,500
You feel sorry for me, huh?

557
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Don't feel sorry for me.

558
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,300
You don't know anything
about me.

559
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,300
I save lives.I'm a hero.

560
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,300
A hero!

561
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
What?

562
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,800
What?!

563
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:30,588
???

564
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:32,107
Good job buddy

565
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:37,077
Yeah, nice job.

566
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:40,658
Sam, great job.

567
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:51,799
Dirk the jerk.

568
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,893
??

569
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Dad?

570
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,200
Finally.

571
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,600
I can't wait to get
the hell out of here. This place sucks.

572
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,100
Come on, sam.

573
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,200
Uh, mr. Wyatt?

574
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,600
Yes.

575
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,700
You probably
don't remember me,

576
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,000
Um, but my name
is sam winchester,

577
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,300
And i just
wanted to thank you.

578
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,400
For?

579
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,900
I was a student here,

580
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,700
And you gave me
some advice once.

581
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,800
Winchester, right.
Right. Yeah.

582
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,900
You, uh --
You wrote that horror story.

583
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,300
Yeah. Yeah, i did.

584
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,200
Yeah, it's kind of all been
one long horror story.

585
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
What do you mean?

586
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,900
Nothing. Sorry.

587
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,500
So, what was this advice?

588
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,900
I might need to plagiarize
myself down the line.

589
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,600
You told me that i didn't have
to go into the family business.

590
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,100
You said i should
make my own choices.

591
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,400
So you've managed to
do your own thing, then, huh?

592
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,200
Yeah, for a while, yeah.

593
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,400
And i think i went to college
because of you.

594
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,400
But, you know,
people grow up.

595
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Yeah.

596
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,700
Responsibilities.

597
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,400
But still, um...

598
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,200
you took an interest in me
when no one else did.

599
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,100
That matters,
so thanks you.

600
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,400
Well, you know, the only thing
that really matters

601
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Is that you're happy.

602
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Are you happy, sam?
