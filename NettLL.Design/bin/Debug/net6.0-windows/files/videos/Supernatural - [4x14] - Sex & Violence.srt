1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,300
??

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,600
Your brother is heading down
a dangerous road, Dean.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Okay.
I'm in.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,700
You gonna tell Dean
about what we're doing?

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,400
I just got to figure out
the right way to say it.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
He's gonna find out,

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,300
And if it's not from you,
he's gonna be pissed.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,800
He's gonna pissed anyway.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,900
You satisfied?

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,300
Why do you trust her so much?

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,100
I told you, Dean,
she helped me go after Lilith.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, thanks for the
thumbnail -- Real vivid.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,100
Something major must've happened
while I was downstairs,

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,900
'Cause I come back and --
And you're bff with a demon?

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,000
You want to fill in
a little detail?

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Sure, Dean.
Let's trade stories.

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,200
You first. How was hell?
Don't spare the details.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,900
???

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Hey.

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,700
What?

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Ted's kind of cracking the whip, isn't he?

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,700
You think I like
coming home late?

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm working my ass off.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,300
Okay.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Sorry.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,700
No, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,700
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Long day.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,600
Oh, hey. I ran into
jill martin today.

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,900
Gary's turning 40 on saturday.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,100
- Yeah?
- She invited us to the party.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,400
- What'd you tell her?
- That we'd go.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're kidding.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,900
What?
You like gary.

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, that doesn't mean That I want
to waste my saturday night with him.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,800
I thought you'd want to go.

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,200
I don't believe you.

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,100
I-It's fine.

39
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,300
I'll -- I'll call jill and
tell her we can't make it.

40
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,300
What's with you tonight?

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
It's like you want to
have a fight or something.

Yeah, that's what I'm
telling you. No storms, no --

46
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
No bad crops, nothing.

47
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

48
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,600
OK£¬i will keep looking.
You keep looking, too, okay?

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,800
All right, talk soon.

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Hey.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
Up and at 'em, kiddo.

52
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,800
You're up early.
What are you doing?

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,300
Nothing. I was in the can.

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Yeah?

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,500
Yeah. Want me to
draw you a picture?

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
No, I'll pass.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I found a job --
Bedford, iowa.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
- Guy beat his wife's brains out with a meat tenderizer.
- Yikes.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,300
And get this -- Third local inside
two months To gank his wife.

60
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,700
No priors on any of them,
all happily married.

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
Sounds like
"ozzie and harriet."

62
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,200
More like "the shining."

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
All right, well, I guess
we better have a look.

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Why does the p.D.
Keep sending you guys?

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,100
I already said
I don't want a lawyer.

66
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
They're lining up
the firing squad.

67
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,600
I'm pleading guilty.

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
All right, look, you don't
want us to represent you --

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,900
That's fine.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,200
In fact, it's probably not a
bad idea, between you and me.

71
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
We just want to
understand what happened.

72
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,100
That's all.

73
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,100
Mr. Benson...

74
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
...please.

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
What happened was...

76
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
I killed my wife.

77
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,800
And you want to know why?

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,300
Because she made plans
without asking me.

79
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,000
When it happened,
how did you feel?

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Disoriented?
Out of control?

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,300
Like something
possessed you to do it?

82
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,400
I knew exactly
what I was doing.

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
I was crystal clear.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,900
- Then why did you do it?
- I don't know.

85
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,200
I loved her.
We were happy.

86
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,200
9 g's.

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,100
That's a hefty bill.

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,000
- Where did you get that?
- Doesn't matter. We have it.

89
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,200
See, certain charges --

90
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
Ones you don't want
the missus to know --

91
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,700
They show up under shady names
like "m & c entertainment."

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,100
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

93
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,300
Oh, you're dropping plastic
at a nudie bar, for instance.

94
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,500
We just... want to know
the truth, mr. Benson.

95
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,300
Her name was...

96
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,600
jasmine.

97
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,000
She was a stripper?

98
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
Dude, her name was jasmine.

99
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,200
I didn't mean for it to happen.

100
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,700
I don't like to
go to strip bars.

101
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,900
My buddy was having
a bachelor party,

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,700
And...
there she was.

103
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,000
- Jasmine.
- She came right up to me. And...

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
I-I don't know,
s-She was just...

105
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Perfect.

106
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,800
Everything that I wanted.

107
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,500
Well, you pay enough,
anybody will be anything.

108
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
It wasn't about the money.

109
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,800
It wasn't even about
the sex. It was --

110
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,100
I don't know.

111
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,800
I don't know what it was.
It's hard to explain.

112
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
And your wife found out?

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,900
No, she never had a clue.

114
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,600
Then why'd you kill her?

115
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,700
For jasmine.

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,000
She said we would
be together forever,

117
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,000
If -- If only j--Vicki was...

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,600
Muerte.

119
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,700
Afterwards, me and jasmine were
supposed to meet, And she never showed.

120
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,200
I don't know where she lives.
I don't know her last name.

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't even know
her real first name.

122
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
I'm an idiot.

123
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,000
And you didn't think
to tell this to the cops?

124
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,800
What for?

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,200
The stripper didn't
do it. I did it.

126
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,100
And I know what I deserve.

127
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,500
Judge doesn't give me the death
sentence, I'll just do it myself.

128
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,800
- Rough night?
- Fun night.

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,400
Rough morning.

130
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Can I help you?

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,900
Uh, yes.

132
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm special agent stiles -- Fbi.

133
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,700
- You're dr. Cara roberts?
- Far as I know.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You do some work with
the sheriff's department?

135
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,500
Yeah, when I'm not
slogging it through the e.R.

136
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,500
It's a small town.
We multitask.

137
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Well, I have some questions about
a case -- About several cases, actually.

138
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
You mind if I sit? Great.

139
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Uh, adam benson, jim wylie,
and steve snyder?

140
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Oh, yeah. The men
who killed their wives.

141
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,500
You handled the
work-Ups, right?

142
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,200
Autopsies for the wives and
tox screens for the perps.

143
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,500
Two-For-One special.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,200
- You find anything?
- Not really.

145
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,700
I mean, c.O.D. On the
women was pretty clear --

146
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,400
There was nothing
unusual in their system.

147
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,700
What about the husbands?

148
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,500
Can I see your badge again?

149
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,800
There was one thing --

150
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,200
Um, an anomaly
in the blood work.

151
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
And I remember thinking
how strange it was

152
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,000
That it showed up
in all three of the men.

153
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
- That what showed up?
- Oxytocin.

154
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
And their levels
were crazy high.

155
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,700
- Uh, oxytocin?
- Mm-Hmm,

156
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,600
it's a hormone That's produced
during childbirth, lactation, And sex.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,700
Okay.

158
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,000
People call it the love hormone.

159
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,400
Um, you know how it feels
when you first fall in love --

160
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
The whole weak-In-The-Knees,
tattoo-You-On-My-Chest thing?

161
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
That's oxytocin.

162
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,000
Of course, it eventually fades, And then
you're stuck with every relationship ever,

163
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,500
That and the painful
regimen of tattoo removal.

164
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
What'd I miss?

165
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,600
This is my partner --
Agent murdock.

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,300
Please, "agent" sounds so formal.

167
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,800
- You can call me Dean.
- I'm dr. Roberts.

168
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,500
So, um...

169
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Can I help you
with anything else?

170
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Uh...sure.
Just one more thing.

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
- This chemical, this...
- Oxytocin....

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,100
oxytocin --

173
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,600
What would cause those
high levels that you found?

174
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,400
Nothing that I've ever seen.

175
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Okay. That's it.
Thanks, doc.

176
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,100
By the way, uh,
try a greasy breakfast.

177
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,600
Best thing for a hangover.

178
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,900
Watch it, buddy.
I'm the only m.D. Here.

179
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,500
Dude, you totally c-Blocked me.

180
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,400
So, wylie and
snyder fessed up, huh?

181
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,000
One emptied his I.R.A.,
The other, his kid's college fund --

182
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,200
All on the same thing.

183
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,400
Live nude girls?

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
Club called c dhoney wagon.

185
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
These guys have affairs, too,
With a stripper also known as jasmine?

186
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,900
Yes and no.
This is where it gets interesting.

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Each guy hooked up
with a different chick.

188
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,100
So, what, these girls
all connected somehow?

189
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,400
Well, they all described their stripper
in the same way, The exact same way --

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,500
Perfect and everything
that they wanted.

191
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,500
Yeah, at least they'll dream Barbie
convinced them to murder their wives.

192
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,400
There's that.

193
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
You know, it's almost like they
were under some kind of love spell.

194
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Sure seems that way.

195
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Which caused them to
become totally psychotic.

196
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,700
Absolutely.

197
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,900
You seem pretty cheery.

198
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,300
Strippers, sammy. Strippers.

199
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,300
We are on an actual
case involving strippers.

200
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,500
??

201
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,600
I'm looking for three girls --

202
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,800
Jasmine, aurora, and ariel.

203
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,400
You seriously think
those names mean anything to me?

204
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,800
One's a redhead about 5'9".
The other one's asian about --

205
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Do you have any idea
how many girls I deal with?

206
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,800
Fake names, fake hair, fake...

207
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,100
You got to have some sort
of paperwork, check stubs,

208
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,900
Some way to keep
track of the strippers.

209
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Please. Exotic dancers --

210
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,500
Independent contractors
working for cash.

211
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,000
I stay out of their hair.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,700
They stay out of
what little I have left.

213
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,800
Three of your customers
murdered their wives.

214
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,600
You don't think
that that's weird?

215
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,800
Yeah, I think that's
super-Freakin' weird.

216
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,000
But you know what
it ain't? My problem.

217
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Any luck?

218
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,400
No. You?

219
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
A little. I just talked to Bobby.

220
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,100
We officially have a theory.

221
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,800
- What's that?
- Siren.

222
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,200
Like greek-Myth siren?
Like "the odyssey"?

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hey, I read.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
Yeah, actually, but the
siren's not actually a myth.

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,200
It's more of a beautiful
creature that prey on men,

226
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,300
Entice them with
their siren song.

227
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,900
Let me guess --
"Welcome to the jungle"?

228
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,200
No, no. Warrant's "cherry pie"?

229
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,300
Their song is
more of a metaphor --

230
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,500
Like their call,
their al, you know?

231
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,600
So they shake their thing
and the guys zombie out?

232
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,800
Basically, yeah.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,400
Sirens live on islands.
Sailors would chase them,

234
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,500
Completely ignoring the rocky
shores, And dash themselves to pieces.

235
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,300
- Sounds like adam and his buddies.
- Ah.

236
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,400
If you were a siren in '09 And
looking to ruin a bunch of morons,

237
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,100
Where would you set up shop?

238
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,100
So, whatever floats the guy's boat,
That's what they look like?

239
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah. You see,
sirens can read minds.

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,300
They see what you want most,

241
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,300
And then they can kind of, like,
cloak themselves --

242
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,800
You know, like an illusion.

243
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,900
So it could all be the same chick,

244
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,800
Morphing into
different dream girls?

245
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Yeah, actually. Probably.

246
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,300
Sirens are usually pretty solitary.

247
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,800
- How do we kill it?
- Bobby's working on it.

248
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
But even if we figure that out...

249
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,300
How the hell are we gonna find it?
It could be anybody.

250
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
Hi, belle.

251
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
Thought you'd never come.

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
It's okay.
She's asleep.

253
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,000
Lenny, you're amazing...

254
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Taking care of her like this.

255
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
Most guys would have
put her in a nursing home.

256
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,000
It's no big deal.

257
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,900
She's my mom.

258
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,400
Like I said --

259
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Amazing.

260
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Baby...

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,200
...I love you so much.

262
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,400
The way you take care of me and your mom --

263
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,200
You're so sweet...

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,600
And strong.

265
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,200
I just wish you didn't have to carry it all.

266
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,000
I mean, your mom takes up all your time.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,200
As long as she's around,

268
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,700
we can't really be happy.

269
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,500
She's not so bad.

270
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,400
I could be with you...

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Forever...

272
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,900
If only your mom wasn't here.

273
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Don't you want to be with me forever?

274
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Yeah.

275
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,800
Yeah, you know I do.

276
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,500
Then bash your mother's brains in.

277
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,000
Baby, do it for me.

278
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,300
Do it, baby.

279
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,100
Yeah, okay.

280
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,000
If you say so.

281
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I love you.

282
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,300
Hey, Sam.

283
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,300
Sam?

284
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,800
You there?

285
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,900
Lenny bristol was definitely another siren vic.

286
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,300
- You got in to see him?
- Yep.

287
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,800
Said he brought a stripper home named belle.
Couple hours later, he offed his mother.

288
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
Belle, of course, went m.I.A.

289
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,200
Wait. He killed his mom?

290
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,100
Woman he was closest to.

291
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
Yeah, you, uh...

292
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,400
forgot your cellphone.

293
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey, Bobby.

294
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,900
Sam, did you find her yet?

295
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,700
Uh, no,

296
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,400
And doesn't seem like she's slowing
down any. What about you? Got anything?

297
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Well, some lore from a dusty greek poem.

298
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Shockingly, it's a little vague.

299
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,600
Oh, hold on a sec. I'm
gonna put you on speaker.

300
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,600
It says you need "a bronze dagger

301
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,000
Covered in the blood of a sailor
under the spell of the song."

302
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,100
What the hell does that mean?

303
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,300
You got me.

304
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,200
We're dealing with 3,000
years of the telephone game here.

305
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Best guess?

306
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
Well,

307
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,200
the siren's spell ain't got
nothing to do with any song.

308
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,000
It's most likely some
kind of toxin or venom.

309
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,900
Something she gets in the vics' blood.

310
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,100
That makes them go all
manchurian candidate.

311
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,500
Uh, what do you think? She
infects the men during sex?

312
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,600
Maybe.

313
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,300
Supernatural std.

314
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,200
Well, however it happens,

315
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,900
Once it's done, the siren's
got to watch her back.

316
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,500
If she gets a dose of her own medicine...

317
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,800
It kills her.

318
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,300
Like a snake getting iced by its own venom.

319
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,400
So we just got to find a way to
juice one of the o.J.S in jail?

320
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,500
It's not that easy.

321
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,200
None of those guys are
under the spell anymore.

322
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,900
Haven't got a clue where you're
gonna get the blood you need.

323
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,300
I think I might have an idea.

324
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,600
Be careful.

325
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
These things are tricky bastards.

326
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,500
Wrap you up in knots before
you know what hit you.

327
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Dr. Roberts.

328
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,200
Agent stiles.

329
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Can't stay away, huh?

330
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,900
Actually, we're here on business About the
blood samples, the ones with the high...

331
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,000
...you know, oxytocin.

332
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,800
Do you still have them?

333
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,400
Good. We need them.

334
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,500
What for?

335
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,100
Excuse me, dr. Roberts?

336
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,000
- Yeah?
- Excuse me.

337
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,000
we're a little busy here, buddy.

338
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,600
Yeah, so am I, pal.

339
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,700
Doc, could you give us a sec, please?

340
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,300
- Sure.
- Thanks.

341
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,900
What's your name?

342
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,200

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,900

350
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,700
What are your badge numbers?

351
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,800
You're kidding, right?

352
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,100
I'm just following protocol.

353
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,900
Look, man, whatever. Just call our
a.D. He'll sort things out, huh?

354
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,500
Uh, yeah, assistant
director kaiser, please.

355
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,300
Yeah, sir, hello. It's agent nick monroe.

356
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,900
I'm calling about...

357
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,400
two of your men -- Stiles and murdock?

358
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,100
Uh, it seems that they've been
put on my case by mistake.

359
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,900
Are you questioning my authority?

360
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,000
No, no, no, sir. I'm not questioning.

361
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,600
You could have fooled me.

362
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,700
Last time I checked,
son, d.C. Has jurisdiction.

363
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,400
Or am I wrong?

364
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,800
??

365
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,900
Well, good.

366
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,200
Well, the next time you want to waste
my time with stupid questions, don't.

367
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Those idjits.

368
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,300
Well, I'm sorry, guys.

369
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Just don't let it happen again.

370
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,900
So, where are you at with this?

371
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,700
Where are you at with this?

372
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,300
Well, I was about to run the perps' blood work.

373
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,000
I already checked. It's a dead end.

374
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,800
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

375
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,900
Well, get this -- I feel like I found
something that connects all the murderers.

376
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,100
Really?

377
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,900
They were all banging strippers

378
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,100
From the same club.

379
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,800
You don't say.

380
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,300
What do you say we go
down there and check it out?

381
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,100
Well, here's the thing, nick.

382
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
See, we're kind of lone wolves --

383
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,500
You know what? That sounds like an excellent idea.

384
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,600
Just give me a second with
my partner. And we'll, uh --

385
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,200
One second.Come here.

386
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,600
Dude, you got to stay with him.

387
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,500
What?

388
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,000
Keep him out of the way.

389
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:23,900
Why me?

390
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,000
'Cause I got to get the blood samples.

391
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,900
What the hell am I supposed to do with him?

392
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,200
Just take him to the strip club,
Keep an eye out for the siren.

393
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Come on, Dean, just --

394
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,300
Just focus on the naked girls.
You'll forget he's even there.

395
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,900
I'm not doing this for you.
I'm doing it for the girls.

396
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,700
We're taking my ride.
No complaining about the tunes.

397
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,300
No way.

398
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,800
- You drive an impala?
- Yeah.

399
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,700
It's a '67, right?

400
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,300
It's a 3274-Barrel.

401
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,700
Yeah, actually.

402
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
It's a thing of beauty.

403
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Thanks.

404
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,300
How the hell did you talk the bureau
into letting you drive your own wheels?

405
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,700
And you want this blood because...

406
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,600
We'd like to run some tests.

407
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,500
You know, I've run every
test there is. It's, um...

408
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,800
my job.

409
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,600
Notice the lab coat.

410
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,900
We know a specialist who would
like to try out a theory.

411
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,700
If you say so.

412
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,100
What the hell?

413
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
What?

414
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,300
The blood's gone.

415
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,300
"Nobody's fault but mine."

416
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,300
Oh, oh, oh, zeppelin recorded it, '75.

417
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,900
It was a cover of a blind willie johnson tune.

418
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,100
Nice.

419
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,300
"You shook me."

420
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,200
Oh, '69, debut album, written by willie dixon.

421
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
And?

422
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,300
And what?

423
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,700
Written by willie dixon and j.B. Lenoir.

424
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200
Dude. Dude!

425
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,700
You know, for a fed, you're not a total dick.

426
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,900
Aren't we both feds?

427
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,100
Yeah. No, I just, you know --

428
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,500
Not a lot of feds as cool as us, huh?

429
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,900
So, what the hell with this case, man?

430
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,900
How does a girl talk four
different johns into murder?

431
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,500
Crazy world.

432
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,900
I guess.

433
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,900
Hey, can I level with you?

434
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,500
I found something kind of weird.

435
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,400
Oh?

436
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
You brought your weird to the right spot.

437
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,700
Lay it on me.

438
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
I went to the crime scene this morning.

439
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,700
Saw them bagging this up.

440
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,800
So I went back through all the files.

441
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,600
It turns out a flower just like
that was found at every crime scene.

442
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,500
Like it was left on purpose?

443
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,100
I mean, you know, sometimes a serial killer
will leave an object behind, like a calling card.

444
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,700
But with this case?

445
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,400
To tell you the truth...

446
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,600
I got no idea what's going on.

447
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
I think I might.

448
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,200
I've seen a flower like this before.

449
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,200
We've watched them twice.
Whoever took the blood...

450
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,300
Must have tampered with the tapes.

451
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,800
Who has access to your office?

452
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
Everyone. I don't lock it.

453
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
You what?

454
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,600
I've never had this problem before.

455
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,600
What is so important about the blood, anyway?

456
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,900
I think someone drugged the
men, made them commit murder.

457
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,800
What?

458
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
What kind of drug?

459
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,000
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

460
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
I don't know.

461
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,800
I mean, I interviewed those
guys,and they had their reasons.

462
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,300
Yeah, but they all loved their victims.

463
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm sure they did.

464
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,600
Come on.

465
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,600
Haven't you ever been in a relationship
where you really loved somebody

466
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,800
And still kind of wanted
to bash their head in?

467
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,100
Sounds like you're speaking from experience.

468
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,600
Yeah.

469
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,200
Look, I'm sorry. I-I don't mean to pry.

470
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
It's okay.

471
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,600
I was the one who brought it up.

472
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,300
Really?

473
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,900
It's medicine.

474
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,200
I'm a doctor.

475
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,100
His name was carl.

476
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,500
And we were married.

477
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,600
So what happened?

478
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,400
Life happened.

479
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,300
I don't know. I mean, I loved him.

480
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,800
I still do, I guess. But, um,

481
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,700
I don't know. It's just like one day I looked
up, And I was living with a stranger. And...

482
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,800
You know what I mean, right?

483
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,300
I guess Or...

484
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,900
I don't know. Maybe.

485
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,300
People change.

486
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,200
God, I know I did.

487
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,000
But it's nothing to feel
guilty about. It happens.

488
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
So you two split up?

489
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,900
Yeah, I suppose that's a word for it.

490
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,300
You need to get that?

491
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,300
No.

492
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,700
Not right now.

493
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,200
Whatever.

494
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,600
We've all got our own sad stories, so...

495
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,000
...screw it.

496
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,000
Have fun, no regrets, and live
life like there's no tomorrow.

497
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,100
For instance, I have been
thinking about you all night.

498
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,900
Well...

499
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,400
Parts of you.

500
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,800
Just parts?

501
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,400
Like your lips.

502
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,500
They're very distracting.

503
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,400
It's a problem.

504
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,700
And I can't stop thinking about

505
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,400
kissing them.

506
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,100
That so?

507
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,500
So...

508
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,300
...what the hell, huh?

509
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,500
Sam, where the hell have you been?

510
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,400
With cara.

511
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Oh, it's "cara" now.

512
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,300
And you're not picking up your phone.

513
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,400
We were trying to find the
blood samples. Someone stole them.

514
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah, I'll bet.

515
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
What's that supposed to mean?

516
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,800
Nick found flower petals at the crime scenes.

517
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,100
Hyacinths.

518
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,900
- So?
- Hyacinths?

519
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,300
Mediterranean, from the --

520
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,800
From the island Where the whole freakin'
siren myth started in the first place?

521
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,900
- Okay.
- Sam, cara had hyacinth flowers.

522
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,300
You think cara's the siren?

523
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,100
Well, I did a little checking up on her.

524
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,700
She's only been in town for two months.

525
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,400
- Yeah, and?
- And she has an ex-Husband.

526
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,800
A dead ex-Husband -- Carl roberts.

527
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,100
Dropped like a stone, no warning,
supposedly a heart attack.

528
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,800
Well, maybe it was a heart attack.

529
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,300
You're kidding me.

530
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,900
Look, I just don't think it's her.

531
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,500
And what makes you so sure?

532
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,700
I don't know. A hunch.

533
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,900
A hunch?

534
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,600
I'm giving you cold, hard facts here,
and you're giving me a hunch?

535
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,800
Did you sleep with her?

536
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,800
No.

537
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,300
Holy crap. You did.

538
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,200
Middle of "basic instinct"
and you bang sharon stone?

539
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,900
Sam, you could be under her spell right now.

540
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
Dude, I'm not under her spell.

541
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,700
Unbelievable, man. I just don't get it.

542
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,900
What?

543
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Nothing.

544
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,700
No. Say it.

545
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,500
No, it's just --

546
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,700
First it's madison, and then Ruby, and now cara.

547
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,500
It's like what is with you and banging monsters?

548
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,800
Look, Dean, I'm telling you.
It's not cara. I feel fine.

549
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,900
I'll bet you do.

550
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,500
You don't trust me.

551
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,400
No because this could be the siren talking.

552
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,900
Look, just tell me where you are. I'll come
meet you, and we'll figure things out.

553
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,500
No.

554
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,200
Are you serious?

555
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,500
I wish I weren't.

556
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,700
I got to handle this, Sam, by myself.

557
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,400
Sam's in trouble, Bobby.

558
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,500
I think the siren's worked her mojo on him.

559
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,400
Give me a call as soon as you get this.

560
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,500
Hey, man. What's up?

561
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,700
I need your help.

562
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,600
Uh, sure. With what?

563
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,100
Canvassing. We got to find somebody.

564
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,100
She went in just a second ago.

565
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,300
Nice work.

566
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,800
Should we follow her in?

567
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,500
???

568
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,700
I'm just waiting to see
who she comes out with.

569
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,600
So you think,

570
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,400
what...

571
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,900
She's drugging these guys?

572
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,400
Pretty much.

573
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,000
I know how it sounds.

574
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Are you sure about that? 'Cause
it sounds like crazy on toast.

575
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
All these different strippers --
They're magically the same girl.

576
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
But then they're not strippers at all --

577
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
It's dr. Quinn?

578
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,300
It's kind of hard to explain,

579
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,700
But I have my reasons,
and they're good ones.

580
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,800
So you're just gonna have to trust me on it.

581
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah. Okay.

582
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,000
I guess.

583
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,500
Thank you.

584
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,400
That's actually nice to hear.

585
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,100
So, let's say she is drugging her vics.

586
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,400
How's she pulling that off?

587
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,100
She could be injecting them,

588
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,000
You know, or passing the
toxin through physical contact.

589
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Or it could be her saliva.

590
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:37,300
You really should have wiped the lip of
that thing before you drank from it, Dean.

591
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,300
I should be your little brother.

592
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,300
Sam...

593
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,500
...you can't trust him.

594
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,500
Not like you can trust me.

595
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,700
In fact, I really feel like you
should get him out of the way

596
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,100
So that we can be brothers...

597
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,400
Forever.

598
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,400
Yeah.

599
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,200
Yeah, you're right.

600
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,800
Nick,

601
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,200
what are you doing here?

602
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,800
Dean?

603
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,300
I got to tell you, you're
one butt-Ugly stripper.

604
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,900
Well, maybe.

605
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,000
But I got exactly what I wanted. I got Dean.

606
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,300
Dean, come on, man. This isn't
you. You can fight this.

607
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,800
Let me go.

608
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,300
Why don't you cut him just a
little on his neck right there?

609
00:34:58,723 --> 00:34:59,411
Aah!

610
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:02,459
Dean's all mine.

611
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:03,434
You poisoned him.

612
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:04,962
No, I gave him what he needed.

613
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:07,272
And it wasn't some bitch in a g-String.

614
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:09,399
It was you.

615
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:11,893
A little brother that looked up to him

616
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:13,422
That he could trust.

617
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,605
And now he loves me.

618
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:19,623
He'd do anything for me.

619
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:21,105
And I got to tell you, Sam,

620
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,185
That kind of devotion --

621
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:26,788
Watching someone kill for you...

622
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,488
...is the best feeling in the world.

623
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:31,970
Is that why you're slutting all over town?

624
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:34,787
Oh.

625
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,282
I get bored.

626
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:38,993
Like we all do.

627
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:41,534
And I want to fall in love again

628
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:45,043
And again and again.

629
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,263
Tell you what, I have fought some nasty sons of bitches,

630
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:52,475
But you are one needy, pathetic loser.

631
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,555
You won't feel that way in a minute.

632
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,203
No, no.

633
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,887
So, I know you two

634
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,153
Have a lot you want to get off your chests.

635
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:19,832
So why don't you discuss it...

636
00:36:20,664 --> 00:36:24,584
And whoever survives can be with me forever?

637
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:32,699
Well, I don't know when it happened.

638
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:34,458
Maybe when I was in hell.

639
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:37,827
Maybe when I was staring right at you.

640
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,335
But the Sam I knew, he's gone.

641
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:42,217
That so?

642
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:45,081
And it's not the demon blood or the psychic crap.

643
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,898
It's the little stuff --

644
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:50,532
The lies, the secrets.

645
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:51,346
Oh, yeah?

646
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:52,734
What secrets?

647
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,122
Phone calls to Ruby, for one.

648
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,975
So I need your say-So to make a phone call?

649
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:57,476
That's the point.

650
00:36:58,493 --> 00:37:00,109
You're hiding things from me.

651
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,730
What else aren't you telling me?

652
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,409
None of your business.

653
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:06,211
See what I mean?

654
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:09,767
We used to be in this together.

655
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,754
We used to have each other's backs!

656
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:12,361
Okay, fine.

657
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:14,264
You want to know why I didn't tell you about Ruby?

658
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:16,989
And how we're hunting down Lilith?

659
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,345
Because you're too weak to go after her, Dean.

660
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,702
You're holding me back.

661
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:24,151
I'm a better hunter than you are --

662
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,139
Stronger, smarter.

663
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,095
I can take out demons you're too scared to go near.

664
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:29,709
That's crap.

665
00:37:29,852 --> 00:37:30,870
You're too busy sitting around

666
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,590
Feeling sorry for yourself,

667
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:35,457
Whining about all the souls you tortured in hell.

668
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:36,153
Boo-Hoo.

669
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:54,592
You're not standing in my way anymore.

670
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:31,273
Do it for me, Dean.

671
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:40,726
Tell me again how weak I am, Sam, huh?

672
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:42,715
How I hold you back.

673
00:38:51,655 --> 00:38:52,350
No.

674
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:54,348
No!

675
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:38,870
Thanks.

676
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:41,186
Soda?

677
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,355
You boys are driving, ain't ya?

678
00:39:51,424 --> 00:39:52,255
Thanks, Bobby.

679
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:55,359
You know, you -- You hadn't shown up when you did --

680
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:57,670
Done the same for me, more than once.

681
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:00,625
Of course, you could have picked up a phone.

682
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,567
Only took one call to figure out

683
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:05,384
That agent nick monroe wasn't real.

684
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,698
You boys gonna be okay?

685
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:15,847
Yeah, fine.

686
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:16,652
Yeah, good.

687
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:19,962
See you

688
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:28,280
You know, those sirens are nasty things.

689
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:33,006
That it got to you -- That's no reason to feel bad.

690
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:48,310
You gonna say goodbye to cara?

691
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:50,574
Nah.

692
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:52,101
Not interested.

693
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,056
Really? Why not?

694
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:58,749
What's the point?

695
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:02,496
Well, look at you. Love 'em and leave 'em.

696
00:41:06,877 --> 00:41:08,079
Dean, look, you know I didn't mean

697
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:09,559
The things I said back there, right?

698
00:41:09,702 --> 00:41:11,595
That it was just the siren's spell talking?

699
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:12,523
Of course. Me too.

700
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:13,821
Okay.

701
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:16,775
So -- So we're good?

702
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,348
Yeah, we're good.

703
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:37,287
