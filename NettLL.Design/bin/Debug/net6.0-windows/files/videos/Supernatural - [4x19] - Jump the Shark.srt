1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,900
Then

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,300
You left.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,000
Your brother and me --
We needed you.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,500
You walked away, Sam.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,300
You walked away!

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,500
You're the one who said
"don't come back," dad.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,900
You're the one
who closed that door, not me!

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,200
Sammy, i just couldn't accept
the fact That you and me --

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,300
We're just different.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,300
We're not different.
Not anymore.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,900
Ruby, it's been weeks.
I need it.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,700
do you even know how far off
the reservation you've gone?

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,900
How far from normal?
From human?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Your brother is headed down a dangerous road, Dean

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
It's already gone too far, Sam.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,300
If i didn't know you,

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,200
I would want to hunt you.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Now

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,900
Aah!

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,700
No! Go away! 

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
No!

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,100
Aah!

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,500
Aah!

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Oh, my god.

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Oh, my god.

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,500
Oh, god.

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,600
Ohh!

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,500
Ah! Oh, god. 

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,600
Oh, no!.

30
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,300
Supernatural s04e19

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,100
Jump the shark

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,900
Hey.

33
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
How'd you sleep?

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,100
How do you think?

35
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm starving.
Let's get breakfast.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,100
Where? We're like
two hours from anything.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
<i>But i'm hungry now.</i>

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,600
There's probably still a sandwich
on the backseat.

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Ahh.

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,700
It's tuna.

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Is that dad's phone?

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,700
Hello?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,300
Is this John?

44
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,700
He can't come to the phone.
Can i help you?

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,700
No no no... I really...
I need to talk to John.

46
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,100
This is Adam Milligan.
He knows me.

47
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, sorry to be the one
to break this to you, pal,

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,900
but John died
more than two years ago.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Who is this?

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm his son.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,600
Dean, look, best i can tell,
Adam Milligan is real. Um, 

52
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,700
born september 29, 1992,
to Kate Milligan.

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
No father listed
on the birth certificate.

54
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,400
He's an eagle scout, graduated
from high school with honors,

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
And currently goes to
the university of Wisconsin --

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,900
Biology major, pre-Med.

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,300
Dean?
You listening?

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
This is a trap.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Dean, i'm telling you --
The kid checks out.

60
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,500
Great, so he's an actual person
on the planet Earth.

61
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
Sucks he's got a demon in him.

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,100
- Hi. Welcome to cousin Oliver's.
- Thanks.

63
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,400
- Can i --
- We're actually
waiting on somebody.

64
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,700
Thank you.

65
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,300
What are you --

66
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,000
- Holy water?
- Yep -- 

67
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,700
One sip of Jesus juice, this evil bitch
is gonna be in a world of hurt.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,300
And what if
he's not possessed?

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,400
Then he is
a shapeshifter.

70
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,300
Hence the silver.

71
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,800
Look, either way,

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,800
this thing is gonna bleed.
I mean, using dad as bait?

73
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,000
That's the last mistake
of its short, pitiful life.

74
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
What?

75
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,200
- What?
- Dean...

76
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,300
listen -- There's an entry
in dad's journal From january of 1990

77
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,500
Saying he's headed to minnesota
to check out a case.

78
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,800
That's, roughly, oh, about nine months
before the kid was born.

79
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,700
- Coincidence
- Coincidence

80
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Next two pages
of the journal --

81
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,600
Torn out.

82
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,200
You're not actually buying this, are you?

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Look, man, i don't want to believe it either,
I'm just saying it's possible.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I mean, dad would be gone
for weeks at a time,

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,100
And he wasn't
exactly a monk.

86
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,900
I mean,
a hunter rolls into town,

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,000
Uh, kills a monster,
saves the girl...

88
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,900
sometimes
the girl's grateful.

89
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,500
Well, now i'm thinking
about dad sex. Stop talking.

90
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,900
Maybe he slipped one
past the goalie.

91
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,200
Dude!

92
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,000
Adam?

93
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,600
You Sam? 

94
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.
Uh, this is Dean.

95
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Hey.

96
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,800
so um...

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,100
... how did you know my dad?

98
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Uh,
we worked together.

99
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,900
- How did he die?
- On the job.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,500
- He was a mechanic, right?
- A car fell on him.

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,500
Hey, Adam.
How you doing?

102
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,100
Oh, i'll take that.
I am very thirsty.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The usual, Adam?

104
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,400
Uh, yeah.
Thanks, Denise.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,300
So, uh...

106
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
when's the last time
you saw John?

107
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,500
I don't even know.
It's...a couple years.

108
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,000
Why did you decide
to call him now?

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,500
I didn't know
who else to call.

110
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,900
He's the only family
i got.

111
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,400
My mom's missing.

112
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,800
Really? I'm sorry.
Uh, for how long?

113
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,300
It's tragic -- Really.

114
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,600
But if you're John's kid,
Hocome we've never heard of you?

115
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,700
'Cause John and me
didn't really know each other.

116
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,800
Not until
a few years ago, anyway.

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,500
- What do you mean?
- My mom never talked about him.

118
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,900
- I knew some stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

119
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,500
My mom's nurse, and
dad came into the ER, pretty torn up...

120
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
hunting accident or something.

121
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,800
And i knew his name --
John Winchester.

122
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,600
That's about it.
We're not exactly a nuclear family.

123
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,700
Yeah, well,
who is these days?

124
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,500
So, when did you, uh,
when did you finally meet him?

125
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,600
When i was 12.

126
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,500
My mom had
one of his old numbers, and...

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,700
and after i begged her --
God, 24/7--

128
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,200
She finally called him.

129
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,300
God, when John heard
he had a son, he raced to town.

130
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,800
I mean, he dropped everything.
He drove all night.

131
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
- There you go.
- Thanks.

132
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,300
Well,
that's heartwarming.

133
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,100
- You mind?
- No, please, dig in.

134
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,300
He would swing by once a year or so,

135
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,700
You know, called when he could.
But still...

136
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300
he taught me poker and pool And 

137
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,900
even bought me my first beer
when i was 15.

138
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,300
And, uh...

139
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
he showed me
how to drive. Dad -- 

140
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,600
He had this beautiful '67 impala.

141
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,900
Oh, this is crap.
You know what -- You're lying.

142
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,600
- No, i'm not.
- Uh, yeah, you are.

143
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm sorry, but who the hell
are you to call me a liar?

144
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
We're john winchester's sons,
that's who.

145
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,700
We are his sons.

146
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,900
- I've got brothers?
- No, you don't have brothers.

147
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,200
Look, man, i don't know if you're a hunter
Or what kind of game you're playing here.

148
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,800
I have never been hunting
in my life.

149
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,700
Whatever. I'm out of here.
Come on, Sam.

150
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,300
I can prove it.

151
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
He took you
to a baseball game?

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,900
Yeah,
when i turned 14.

153
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,900
Dad was around
for a few of my birthdays.

154
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,300
September 29, 2004.

155
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,300
One word --
"Minnesota."

156
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,600
He took you
to a freakin' baseball game?

157
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, 

158
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,500
Why? What'd dad do with you
on your birthday?

159
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,800
Oh...

160
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,600
Adam, you said you called dad
because your mom was missing.

161
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,900
- Yeah.
- How long has she been gone?

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
Three days.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
Who was the last person
to see her?

164
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,300
Mr. Abbinanti,
our neighbor.

165
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,600
He saw her come home
tuesday night,

166
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
But she never showed up
to work on wednesday.

167
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,100
- Did you call the police?
- Mom's supervisor at the hospital did.

168
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,100
And then i drove down here
as fast as i could.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,700
I should have been here.

170
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,800
What'd the, uh,
what'd the cops say?

171
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,100
That they, uh,
they searched the house.

172
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,900
They didn't find anything.

173
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,900
She wouldn't leave
without telling anybody.

174
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,800
It's like she just dropped off
the face of the earth, you know?

175
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,000
The, uh, nightstand was knocked
over. Was there anything else?

176
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,400
Oh, not really. The sheriff said
there's no sign of a break-In.

177
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,100
What -- You think
the cops missed something?

178
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,200
Maybe.

179
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,000
They don't have my eyes.

180
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
You're a mechanic.

181
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Yeah. That's right.

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,300
Dean, what else
can you tell me about dad?

183
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,000
You knew him.

184
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,900
Not as well as you.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,400
Trust me, kid --

186
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,700
You don't want to know.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,500
Give us a minute.

188
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,800
You talk to the cops?

189
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,400
Yeah. Like adam said,
no leads on his mom.

190
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,600
- Shocker there.
- But i did find this. Um...

191
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,600
here.

192
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,000
In 1990, there were
17 grave robberies in Windom.

193
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,100
You think that's why
dad came through here?

194
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,200
I'd say so.
Check it out.

195
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,400
All right, so he was
hunting something. What?

196
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,200
No idea. Those were the pages
he threw out of the journal.

197
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,500
But last month,
the corpse snatching started up again

198
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,900
Three bodies from the local cemetery.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,700
So whatever he was after,

200
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,400
he didn't kill it. It's back.

201
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,400
And...what -- It's stepped up
its game to fresh meat? I mean, 

202
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Kate's missing, and, uh...

203
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,300
so is a local bartender --
a guy named Joe Barton.

204
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,900
Hey, does your mom
know Joe Barton?

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,900
Uh, i don't think so.
Why?

206
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,200
- What is it?
- Watch out.

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,600
Give me a hand
with the mattress.

208
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,900
Every time.

209
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,800
Why didn i pick paper?

210
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,000
Who the hell are you?

211
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,400
Adam, hey.
Take it easy.

212
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,300
No, don't tell me
to take it easy, okay?

213
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,800
My house is a crime scene,
my mom's probably dead, and you two -- 

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,300
Well, you tell me to call the cops,
But you got to bail before they show?

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,600
So, who are you really?

216
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,900
Cops didn't know where to look
for my mom, Dean, but you did.

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,800
and i heard you talking earlier --
Something about grave robberies.

218
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
You're not mechanics.

219
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,600
I just want to know
what's going on.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,500
Please.

221
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,700
We're hunters.

222
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,900
- Sammy!
- He deserves to know, Dean.

223
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,700
What do you mean, "hunters"?

224
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Okay, so... 

225
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,200
basically, You're saying
that every movie monster,

226
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,400
Every nightmare that
i've ever had -- That's all real?

227
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
"Godzilla's" just a movie.

228
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,300
We hunt them.

229
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
So did dad.

230
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,100
Okay.

231
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,300
"Okay"? That's it?

232
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,300
What am i supposed to say?

233
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
That we're liars,
that we're crazy.

234
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
Nobody just says "okay."

235
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
You're my brothers.

236
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,100
You're telling me
the truth, right?

237
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,100
- Yeah.
- Then i believe you.

238
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,300
Now, what took my mom?

239
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
We're not sure.

240
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Something's in town stealing
bodies -- <i>Living and dead --

241
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
But we don't know what.</i>

242
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,600
There's a long list of freaks
that fit the bill.

243
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,200
You think maybe
she might still be alive?

244
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
Oh.

245
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
How can i help?

246
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
You can't.

247
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,200
This thing killed my mom.
If you're hunting it, i want in.

248
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,700
- No.
- Dean, look, maybe --

249
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,500
Maybe what?

250
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,300
He lost his mother. Maybe we can
understand what that feels like.

251
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,500
Why do you think dad never
told us about this kid, Sam?

252
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Huh? Why do you think
he ripped out the pages?

253
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,700
- Because --
- Because he was protecting him!

254
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,200
Dad's dead, Dean.

255
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,000
That doesn't matter!

256
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,900
He didn't want adam
to have our lives, okay?

257
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,600
And we'anre gonna
respect s wishes.

258
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,800
- Do i get a say in this? - No!
- No

259
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
- Babysit the kid.
- Where are you going?

260
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,600
I'm going out!

261
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,100
Is he always like that?

262
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,100
Welcome to the family.

263
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,200
Here.

264
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm gonna teach you
a few things.

265
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,800
Uh, Dean said --

266
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,300
I know what Dean said.

267
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,400
And i know what it's like
to want revenge.

268
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,500
This tomb was built in 1926.

269
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,300
Four generations of the Millsap
family were interred here.

270
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,400
They don't build 'em
like this anymore.

271
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,200
Tell me, agent Nugent,

272
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,700
have you thought about <i>Where you
might like to spend eternity?</i>

273
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,000
All the damn time.

274
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,200
So, three bodies went missing.
Any idea who did it?

275
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,100
Hooligans --
Sick, deranged hooligans.

276
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,900
This isn't blood.
What is this?

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,500
No, it's embalming fluid.

278
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,000
<i>Whoever committed this crime
didn't just take the corpses.</i>

279
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,700
They opened them up.

280
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,500
First beer's on the house for cops.
Feds too.

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
- Am i that obvious?
- I know all the local badges.

282
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,300
And you've got that... "law & order" vibe.

283
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,700
So, what's the FBI
doing in Windom?

284
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,300
Looking into
the disappearance of Joe Burton.

285
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,000
I assume you knew him?

286
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,400
A little.

287
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,700
I'm his wife. Lisa.

288
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,100
Well, Lisa, what can you tell me
about his disappearance?

289
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
Same thing I told the sheriff.

290
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,900
He stayed late friday before
last to do inventory --

291
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,400
Never came home.

292
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,400
And the police?

293
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Nothing.

294
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,900
Truth is, i was scared
they stopped looking.

295
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,600
But now you're here

296
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Joe was a cop?

297
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,200
Deputy. For a little while.

298
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
That was a lo-ong time ago.

299
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,500
He didn'het happen to work
the, uh...

300
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,800
The grave robbery case, back in '90?

301
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,700
He did. Yeah.

302
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,600
Joe was the one
who found those bodies.

303
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,100
He got an award
for that.

304
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,300
That was
an interesting case.

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,500
He ever tell you
how he did it?

306
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Most of the time,
he said good, solid police work.

307
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,100
But after a few beers,
he'd admit he had a little help.

308
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,300
From who?

309
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,900
A "specialist" --
That's all he'd say.

310
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Cops ever find the guy
that stole the bodies?

311
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
No.

312
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,900
But when i asked Joe about it,
he'd say not to worry --

313
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,800
That "we took care
of what done it."

314
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,300
Sam...

315
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,600
how did dad really die?

316
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,600
Demon.

317
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,300
You hunted it down?

318
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,800
Got revenge?

319
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,500
Dean killed it.

320
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,500
So it's over for you.

321
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,400
It's never over.

322
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,200
- What the --
- Shh.

323
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,600
Stay here.

324
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,000
It's in the vents.

325
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Go!

326
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,600
where's your car?

327
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,900
Over here.

328
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Allright, keys.

329
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,400
Here.

330
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,500
Sam!

331
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,600
Dean, help!

332
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,900
I winged it.
Did you see anything?

333
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,300
I didn't get
a good look.

334
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,400
What the hell
is this thing?

335
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,000
Why -- Who --
Should we go after it?

336
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,200
No, no.

337
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,000
In that maze?
That thing's long gone.

338
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,100
All right, so, we don't know what it is,
But we do know who it's going after --

339
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,100
- Joe Barton, Adam's mom.
- and Adam.

340
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,900
It was under his truck,
just waiting for him.

341
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,600
It set a trap,
and i walked right into it.

342
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,500
Doesn't matter. You're right --
There's a pattern.

343
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,200
Joe barton was a cop.

344
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm pretty sure he helped out dad.
So we've got him,

345
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,900
dad's girl...

346
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
and his son.

347
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,100
All the people
dad knew in town.

348
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,700
At least we know
why it's back.

349
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,200
It wants revenge.

350
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,400
Grab your stuff.
We'll hit the road.

351
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,800
We shouldn't leave.

352
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,900
Yeah, let's stay here,
 where the kid's mom got ganked.

353
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,400
- Good one.
- I'm serious.

354
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,100
No, Sam, we're gonna take the kid,
we're gonna drop him off at Bobby's,

355
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,300
and then you and me are gonna come back here
and finish what dad started.

356
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,200
How?

357
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
We got no leads,
no witnesses.

358
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,600
We do have
what this thing wants.

359
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,500
You want to use the kid
as bait?

360
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,400
That's why
you want to stay here?

361
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,100
Maybe this thing will come back.
We could train Adam --

362
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,100
Get him ready.

363
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,300
He could die, Sam.

364
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,900
We could all die, Dean.

365
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,900
Even if we do kill this thing, there are
tons of other freaks that want revenge --

366
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
On dad, on us.

367
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,600
What if they find the kid
instead and he's not ready?

368
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,400
I'll do it.

369
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,800
Whatever it takes,
i'll do it.

370
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
I want to do it.

371
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,200
- Whoa.
- It's easy.

372
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,000
Just feel the recoil
and time the trigger pulls.

373
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,300
Three taps.

374
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,700
- Yeah?
- Go ahead.

375
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,600
Beginner's luck,
right?

376
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,400
Nah, man.
You're a natural.

377
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,500
- Good shooting.
- Thanks.

378
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,800
So, then we lit it on fire.

379
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
With a homemade
flamethrower?

380
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,300
Yeah.
They're easy to build.

381
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,300
I'll show you.

382
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,500
That is some job
you got, man.

383
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,800
Being a hunter
isn't a job, Adam.

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,700
It's life.

385
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,800
You're pre-Med.
you got a girlfriend, friends?

386
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,200
Not anymore you don't.

387
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,100
If you're
really gonna do this,

388
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,700
You can't have those kinds
of connections -- Ever.

389
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,200
They're weaknesses.

390
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,300
You'll just put those people
in danger -- Get them killed.

391
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,600
That's the price we pay.

392
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,100
You cut 'em out,
and you don't look back.

393
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,200
There's only one thing
you can count on --

394
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,100
Family.

395
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,300
Sam.

396
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
Can i talk to you?

397
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,000
What the hell
was that?

398
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
What?

399
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,400
"Hunting is life.
You can't have connections."

400
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,300
Dad gave you that
exact same speech, remember?

401
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,100
It was just before
you ditched us for Stanford.

402
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,300
You hated dad for saying that stuff,
and now you're quoting him?

403
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,300
Yeah, well...
turns out dad was right.

404
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,000
- Since when?
- Since always.

405
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,200
Dean, when i look at Adam,
you know what i see?

406
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
- A normal kid.
- No. Meat.

407
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,400
Because the demons and monsters
out there, That's all he is.

408
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,200
I hated dad for a long time.
I did.

409
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,400
But now i think i understand.

410
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,300
So we didn't have a dog
and a white picket fence.

411
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,500
So what?
Dad did right by us.

412
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,700
He taught us
how to protect ourselves.

413
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,200
Adam deserves the same.

414
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,800
- Listen to yourself, man.
- You think i'm wrong?

415
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,800
I think
it's too late for us.

416
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,900
This is our life.
This is who we are, okay?

417
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,000
And it's fine.
I accept that. But with Adam,

418
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,400
he's still got a chance, man.
He can go to school.

419
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,500
- He could be a doctor.
- What makes adam so special?

420
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,600
- What, are you jealous of the kid?
- Are you?

421
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,800
Dean...

422
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,600
all this...

423
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,300
it's not real.

424
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,500
The dad adam knew --
He wasn't real.

425
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,400
The things out there
in the shadows -- They are real.

426
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,200
The world is coming to an end.
That's real.

427
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,000
Everything else is just part of the crap
People tell themselves to get through the day.

428
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,700
Dad didn't have a choice with us, okay?
But with Adam, he did.

429
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,100
- Adam doesn't have to be cursed.
- He's a Winchester.

430
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,900
He's already cursed.

431
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,000
No.

432
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,400
No, whatever's hunting Adam,
i'm gonna find it.

433
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
- You already looked everywhere, Dean.
- Well, then i'll look again.

434
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,300
Home sweet home.

435
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,300
Sloppy Joe.

436
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,100
Oh, son of a bitch!

437
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,000
Son of a bitch.

438
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,900
All right.

439
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,800
We've closed off every
other way into the house.

440
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,700
If this thing's coming,
it's coming through there.

441
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,300
You were saying?

442
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Adam!

443
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,200
- Adam!
- Mom?

444
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
- No.
- Mom!

445
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,500
Adam!

446
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,000
Mom.

447
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,900
Adam, wait!

448
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,500
It took me, but i got away.

449
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,800
- It's OK.
- I got away.

450
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,200
Adam, step away from her.

451
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,200
Sam, what the hell?!

452
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
She's not your mother!

453
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,200
Adam, who -- What is going on?

454
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,300
- Get away from him!
- What is going on?

455
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,900
- You listen to me.
- It's really her, okay?

456
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,700
There was too much blood.
Your mother's dead.

457
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,400
There was too much blood in the vents!

458
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,000
Adam!

459
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,800
- Shoot it!
- He's crazy! It's me!

460
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,800
- Look -- Adam!
- It's me!

461
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
That's not your mother!

462
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,100
- Shoot it! It's not human!

463
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,300
I know.

464
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,500
Silver.

465
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,100
No wonder none of the tests worked.

466
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,800
You're not shapeshifters.

467
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,200
You're ghouls.

468
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,600
You know, i find that term racist.

469
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,500
Fresh meat. So much better
than what we're used to.

470
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,200
I should have known.

471
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
It was the fresh kills that threw me.

472
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,500
Ghouls don't usually go after the living.

473
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,800
See, you're just filthy scavengers,
Feeding off the dead --

474
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,900
Taking the form of
the last corpse you choke down.

475
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,100
And their thoughts. And their memories.

476
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,500
Like adam, for instance.

477
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,200
- Well, we are what we eat.
- You're monsters.

478
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,100
You know, you use that word a lot, Sam.

479
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,300
But i don't think you know what it means.

480
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,300
His blood -- It tastes different.

481
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,800
Our father was a monster?

482
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Why?

483
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,300
Because of what he ate?

484
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
He never hurt anyone, Sam.

485
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,900
Living, anyway.

486
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,700
No.

487
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,700
He was no monster.

488
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,300
But the thing that killed him was.

489
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
A monster named John Winchester.

490
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,300
Holy crap.

491
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,400
Thanks to your daddy,

492
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,200
my brother and i grew up on our own.

493
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,600
At least we had each other.

494
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,600
Like you and your brother --

495
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,400
Inseparable.

496
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,700
Actually, it was very hard
to get you on your own.

497
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,300
Like you said, sam, the only
thing you can count on is family.

498
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,700
And for 20 years, we lived like rats.

499
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,600
Graveyard after graveyard,
all that stinking flesh.

500
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Then we thought, "hey,
why not move up to fresher game?"

501
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And we knew just where to start.

502
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,500
Revenge -- It's never over, is it, Sam?

503
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,400
First, it was John's cop friend,

504
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,900
And then his slut, and then his son.

505
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,500
Then i called john, but...

506
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,100
The son of a bitch was already dead.

507
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,200
So i guess you and dean
will have to do instead.

508
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,800
Dean won't interrupt us this time.

509
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,400
We're gonna feed on you
nice and slow --

510
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,300
Like we did with adam.

511
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,800
Oh, and, by the way,

512
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
<i>He really was your brother.</i>

513
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,200
You should know that.

514
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,400
He was still alive
when we took our first bites.

515
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,500
And he was a screamer.

516
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,400
Sam, the more you struggle,
The faster you're gonna bleed out.

517
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,900
So you might
as well lie back and relax.

518
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,800
Hey!

519
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,100
Dean, they're ghouls!

520
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,200
Which means head-shot.

521
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Dean!

522
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,000
Come on. Come on. Come on.

523
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,700
Hang on.

524
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,900
All right, here we go.

525
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,400
Here we go.

526
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,900
Hang on buddy.

527
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,800
All right.

528
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,600
Thank you.

529
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,500
That's what family's for, right?

530
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,300
Keep pressure on that.

531
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,300
You sure we should do this?

532
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,900
Ghouls didn't fake those pictures.

533
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
They didn't fake dad's journal.

534
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,400
Adam was our brother.

535
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,100
He died like a hunter.
He deserves to go out like one.

536
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,700
Maybe we can bring him back...

537
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
Get ahold of Cass, call in a favor.

538
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,600
No, Adam's in a better place.

539
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,500
You know, i finally get why
you and dad butted heads so much.

540
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,100
You two were practically
the same person.

541
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,600
I mean, i worshipped
the guy, you know?

542
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,600
I-I dressed like him,
i acted like him,

543
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,400
I listen to the same music.

544
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,300
But you were more like him
than i will ever be.

545
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,300
And i see that now.

546
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,900
I'll take that as a compliment.

547
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,200
You take it any way you want.

548
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
