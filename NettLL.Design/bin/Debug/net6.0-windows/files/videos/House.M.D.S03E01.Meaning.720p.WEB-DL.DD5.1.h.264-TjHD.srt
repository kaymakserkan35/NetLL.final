You can take a whole
two minutes
to ease into being back.

I would've taken
a whole month to ease back,

he might have
shot this patient, too?

It could be MS.

It's not MS.

climbed onto her head.

Unless she's been upside-down
for the last 10 years,
MS ain't it.

91
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,303
Could be transverse myelitis,
swelling in the disks,
choking off nerve function.

92

Redo the tests.

of the problem is in the limbs
or the spine. Do an EMG.

You don't think
that's from the pool he drank?

104
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,939
Give him an O2 mask.
His leg muscles
have atrophied.

105
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,644
Tendons have shortened
from disuse,
causing intense pain.

106
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,745
Tendon surgery
will make him
more comfortable.

107
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,521

Mark, the doctor's
just trying to...

114
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,678
- He wouldn't kill himself.
- Fine. I'm wrong.

115
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,716
You obviously have
a better understanding of this man

00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,458
Look, he must have been
confused, all right?
It must have been an accident.

00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,965
I hope it was
a suicide attempt.

120
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,368
If he was trying to
kill himself, then he knows
how miserable his life is.

121
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,498
It means there's still
something there to kill.

122
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,609
It means your dad's
still there.

123
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,440
Sorry. Need you.

124
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,849
Thank you.

125
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,255
We were doing the EMG, but we
never got past the insertion
of the conduction pin.

126
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,297
Did she just say, "Thank you"?

127
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,696
I loaned her some money.
What went wrong?

128
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,926
Nothing went wrong.

129
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,935
If nothing went wrong,
then something went right.

130
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,561
You're not gonna tell me
why she thanked you?

131
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,833
You're not gonna tell me
what went right?

132
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:32,810
You did something
for which she is grateful,
and you're embarrassed?

133
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,337
For you. She saw you
coming up, thought you
were a 14 year-old boy.

134
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,541
I set her straight.

135
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,484
I am not telling you
what went wrong or right

136
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,113
until you tell me why
she said, "Thank you."

137
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:48,286
Oh, you got me.
You know I need to know.
I am so gonna fold.

138
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,990
Except you're forgetting
there's one thing
I can do now.

139
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,629
It's either that
or a reflex response.

140
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,295

141
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,498

Pleasure's all mine.
What happened?

144
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,941
When we inserted
the conduction pin,
she flinched.

145
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,038
She flinched? Did you hear?

146
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,275
Does that mean
I'm getting better?

147
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:14,342
How big is a flinch?
Bigger than a twitch?
Smaller than a spasm?

148
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,982
Do you smoke?
Socially, not a lot.

149
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,719
You do yoga, and you smoke?

150
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,317
I know it's hypocritical,
but...

151
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,162
No, the world sees your legs.
No one's checking out
your lungs.

152
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,461
How would smoking cause...

153
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,832
It wouldn't.
I just needed a lighter.

Oh, my God!

156
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,377

so promising.
Hey, I'm not faking.

157
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,175
You moved,
therefore you can move.

158

Get this lunatic out of here
before she bores again.

159
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,977
I'm not faking!

160
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:15,781
I heard you were
watching surgery
with a patient's family,

161
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,480
talking to a patient's family.

162
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,916
It's because of your
hallucination, isn't it?
After you were shot.

163
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,323
You chose life.
You decided
you wanted meaning,

164
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:32,353
so you took a case
with no mystery,
something any doctor could do,

165
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,458
a case with no upside
except the satisfaction

166
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,765
of helping
another human being.

And you felt nothing.

169
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,177
I wasn't sure what
I was supposed to feel.

170
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:55,981
It's like your leg.
It's atrophied. Keep working
it. The feeling will come.

171
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,250
Sorry. Need you again.

172
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,484
I told you to get rid of her.

173
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,219
It's a good thing we didn't.
Tightness in her chest.

174
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,124
She can't breathe.
It could be pleural effusion.

175
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:07,154
Right. Either that
or she's holding her breath
like a four-year-old.

176
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,396
(GASPING)

177
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,105
Relax. I'm not gonna
burn you again.

178
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,141
I'm going to stab you!

179
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,417
Look, either you're faking,
or you've got
a pleural effusion.

180
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,984
That's a buildup of fluid
around the lungs,
which is very serious,

181
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,497
and I would have no choice
but to stab you in the back
with this needle

182
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,193
and suck all of the fluid
out of you.

183
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,096
So...
CAMERON:
We should give her a local.

184
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,198
That would defeat
the point of me being nasty.

185
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,036
Ready?

186
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,971
(GASPING)

187
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,284
Down.
She can't breathe
if she's down.

188
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,445
Down.
She can't...

189
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,512
Down, down, down! Come on!

190
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,747
(GASPING)

191
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,624
That's not a pleural effusion.

192
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,396
The problem's in her heart.

193
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,134
Can't fake that.

194
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,115
Had to relieve the pressure
three times
in the last two hours,

195
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,623
so either we figure out
what's causing blood to
build up around her heart,

196
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,852
or I follow her around
with a needle
for the rest of her life.

197
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,985
Echo was clean.
No structural abnormalities.

198
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,223
It could be
an infectious process, TB.

199
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,322
Or vasculitis would also
explain the effusion.

200
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,336
But not the paralysis.
Let's assume that
she wasn't faking it.

201
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,840
She moved,
therefore she could move.
She wasn't paralyzed.

202
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,843
Doesn't mean she was faking.
It could have been a delusion.

203
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,435
Now, either she was faking

204
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,481
and coincidentally
got a real cardiac problem

205
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,073
at the exact same time,
or it's a delusion,

206
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,279
and the fake paralysis is
a real neurological symptom.

207
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,379
Are you thinking
vascular tumor on her spine?

208
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,548
Her platelets are normal.

209
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,683
And she's been scanned up
and down. It's all clean.

210
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,852
So open her up and find it.

211
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,654
FOREMAN:
So what do you want us to do?
Just start at her neck

212
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,791
and just keep on cutting down
her spine until we stumble
on something?

213
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,494
That should work.

214
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,010
His heart rate's
a little high.
Should I be worried?

215
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,138
Probably just means
he's still in discomfort
from the surgery.

216
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,649
I'm gonna up his
morphine a little.

217
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,742
You've been so nice to us.

218
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,378
It's the job.

219
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:46,288
No, I mean, all the other
doctors, all they did was
obsess on the cancer,

220
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:50,454
the treatment, the damage,
just trying to fix him.

221
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,496
You're the first doctor
that's ever given a damn
about the quality of his life.

222
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,237
His heart rate's come down.
The morphine worked.
I was right.

223
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,808
What a touching moment.
That's why we become doctors,

224
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,511
for these rare moments
when our hearts are warmed...

225
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,816
Would you like to get a drink?

226
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,656
Are you serious,
or are you just trying to
change the subject?

227
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,555
No, I'm serious.

228
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:26,087
I drink. You drink.
We could do it at the same
time, the same table.

229
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,667
If you eat,
we could do that, too.

230
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,797
I mean, if the answer's no,
that's cool, but...

231
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:42,914
No, it's just you're just
coming off of surgery,
and you're not yourself yet,

232
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,713
and I work for you,
and even though last year's...

233
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,047
You're smiling.
I'm saying no,
and you're smiling.

234
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,889
Well, don't take it
personally. It's just
'cause you're full of crap.

235
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,124
You have no interest in
going out with me. Maybe you
did, when I couldn't walk,

236
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,656
when I was a sick puppy
that you could nurture
back to health.

237
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,636
Now that I'm healthy,
there's nothing in it for you.

238
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,035
You are not healthy.

239
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,343
Cuddy wants to see you.

240
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,411
You've been back at work
24 hours,

241
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,925
and you're already
playing hide-and-seek
in a woman's spine.

242
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,084
Who won the pool?

243
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,593
There's no tumor.

244
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,493
Her platelets are normal.
The scans didn't...

245
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:36,057
What's the worst that can
happen? Might paralyze her.
She won't even notice.

246
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,865
Her lawyers might.
You're not doing the surgery.

247
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,803
And lower the morphine
on your other patient.

248
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,933
Fine, I'll lower it
if you let me do the surgery.

249
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,705
What? You want to trade?

250
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:51,112
We're not swapping
a couple of goats for your
help putting up a barn.

251
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,310
You want something.
I want something.
We compromise.

252
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,977
It's the grownup way
to resolve our differences.

253
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,521
There already is
a mechanism for that,

254
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,647
it's called
the employer-employee
relationship,

255
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,158
I get what I want,
and you don't.

256
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,705
You tried to swap?

257
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,838
Ran a few more tests.
They came back negative.
The surgery's on.

258
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,486
You really don't give a crap,
do you?

259
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,323
Does that make me evil?

260
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,828
Yeah.

261
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,558
The girl's life is at stake.
All we're talking about
with the guy is...

262
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:44,500
All we're talking about is
the reason you took the case,
to help someone.

263
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,299
Too bad for them.
Too bad for you.

264
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,832
The reason we crave meaning
is because it makes us happy.

265
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,075
The first level
of happiness...

266
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,305
I'm not going away.

267
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,716
WILSON: The fifth level of
happiness involves creation,
changing lives.

268
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,278
HOUSE: The sixth level is
heroin. The seventh level
is you going away.

269
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,156
You're saving lives,
which is tantamount
to creating lives,

270
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,162
but all you're taking away
from this is the game.

271
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,629
You don't have to listen
to them thanking you.

272
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,531
You don't have to change
the cases you take
or even how you handle them.

273
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,934
You just have to know
that you made a difference.

274
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,443
House! You're not...
I'm not an idiot.

275
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,051
Move.
SURGEON: House,
leave her alone.

276
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,676
Close her up.
You want to know why?

277
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,084
The room's no longer sterile.

278
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,454
True, but it's not
the most interesting reason.

279
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,119
HOUSE:
That is not a sexy big toe.

280
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,559
You'd never put that
in your mouth.

281
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,721
What the hell does
that got to do...

282
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,358
I told you it was interesting,
but it gets even better.

283
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,261
Scurvy?

284
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,669
Yeah. Drink.

285
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,332
Like what sailors get
when they don't eat right?

286
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,038
Aye, aye.
Your arms and leg tissues
are choked with blood.

287
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,708
It makes it hard to move.
It also damages your hair
and toenails.

288
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,217
But I'm on this great diet,
lots of protein, lots of...

289
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,778
No vitamin C. Now drink.

290
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,912
(SLURPING)

291
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,627
Well, thank you.

292
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,220
And thank Doctor House.

293
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,027
You can send him a note.

294
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:27,037
The nurse changed his
morphine. I thought
you were worried about...

295
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,967
It's just post-op discomfort.
He's ready to go home.

296
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,035
So he won't have any pain?

297
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,740
Eventually.

298
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,411
Thank you.

299
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,645
Everything else
will be the same.

300
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,450
Well, you took away his pain,
and that changes a lot.

301
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,293
Why don't you put him
in some sort of facility,

302
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,790
some place without a pool?

303
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,398
Yeah, I could dump him there,

304
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,567
except he's my husband.

305
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,800
He's my son's father.

306
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,712
Right. Kids need a dad,

307
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,439
someone to play catch with,
talk about girls.

308
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,918
You know, Mark's learning
that you don't have to
abandon someone

309
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,318
just because...
Get a dog.

310
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,724
I'm taking care of him
for the same reason
you helped us.

311
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,854
Because some guy shot you,
and you hallucinated?

312
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,056
I have a responsibility.

313
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,125
So he's just an anchor,
weighing you
and your family down,

314
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,764
sapping your energy, wasting
your life? That's the meaning
you take from this?

315
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,432
I want to take care of him.

316
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,203
You enjoy this?

317
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,040
I can't abandon him.

318
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,105
So you don't want to
take care of him?

319
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,745
Taking care of him
doesn't fulfill you,
make you happy,

320
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,187
but not taking care of him
would make you miserable?

321
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,617
Hmm.

322
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,134
Okay, here we go.

323
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,196
(GRUNTS)

324
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,807
ARLENE: Okay, slowly.

325
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,775
I don't need your help.
I've done this
a million times.

326
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,841
Here, lie him like that.

327
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,723
Do that again.
Make that sound.

328
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,087
(GRUNTS)

329
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,766
What was that?

330
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,642
That was talking.

331
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,583
You guys are lousy doctors.

332
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,851
You were in such a rush
to make the patient
feel better,

333
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,859
you forgot to check
what was wrong.

334
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,327
Yoga girl walked out of here
two hours ago. You fixed her.

335
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,887
Not her. The other guy.
He had brain cancer.

336
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,492
They removed it eight years
ago. His condition's been
the same ever since.

337
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,764
Until last night. He spoke.

338
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,396
What'd he say?

339
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,169
(GRUNTS)

340
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,571
He grunted?

341
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,306
You want us to
dissect eight years

342
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,008
of medical history
with grunting
in the differential?

343
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,710
Sounds good.
Call me when you're done.

344
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,158
You're fabricating a mystery
because you're bored.

345
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,887
I am not bored.

346
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,853
Damn it!

347
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,865
You didn't tell the wife
it was only a grunt?

348
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,230
Of course not.

349
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,328
'Cause then she would
never have consented to

350
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,430
I don't remember
you being this bitchy.

351
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,476
The Vicodin dulled it.
In the sober light of day,
I'm a buzz-kill.

352
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,103
You're giving false hope
to a family
that's been wrecked.

353
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,012
Don't torture them.
Let it go. Tell the wife
it was only a grunt.

354
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,140
Tell her to go home.

355
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,979
I can't let her down
like that.

356
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,282
I pumped her up
with too much false hope.

357
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,215
(EXCLAIMS)

358
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:11,251
I stuck that primo!
How rad am I?

359
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,819
FOREMAN:
2002, patient had dry eyes.

360
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,685
Dry eyes plus a grunt.

361
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,253
It all makes sense.
Could be a neurological issue.

362
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,228
I get hay fever,
I put drops in my eyes.
I don't go to a neurologist.

363
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,959
Dry eyes could indicate
an autonomic dysfunction.

364
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,022
It goes on the board.

365
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,830
What about coughing
or boogers?

366
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:51,926
Should we include boogers?

367
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,595
I'm happy we're doing this.

368
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,539
I'd much rather do this
than lengthen
some guy's tendon.

369
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,203
Patient's headaches increased.
Doc scanned his head,
found a tumor.

370
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,337
You like wasting your time?
I'm learning.

371
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,474
To do what?
Reconsider solved cases

372
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,381
because you don't wanna deal
with the real world?

373
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,851
He's pushing
where there's nothing.

374
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,047
Cameron,
you are an excellent doctor.

375
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,648
You'll get lots of tearful
thank-yous
from grateful patients.

376
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,750
Yeah, aren't I
such a bitch for wanting that?

377
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,591
No, it's not a bad thing,
but it's not why I'm here.

378
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,221
I took this fellowship
to learn from House.

379
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,630
He's teaching you
to be a masochist.

380
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,963
Dry eyes goes on the board.

381
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,699
FOREMAN: In eight years,
the patient experienced
214 symptoms,

382
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,335
many of them repeated.

383
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,504
Any patterns?

384
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:38,675
Fever plus frequent urination
could mean prostatitis.

385
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,513
Or a urinary-tract infection.

386
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,746
White count was normal.
No infection.

387
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,289
FOREMAN: If you add pain
into the mix, fever,

388
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,656
frequent urination
could indicate
a kidney problem.

389
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:49,983
I like it.

390
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,996
No, creatinine and BUN
were both normal.

391
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,225
Not the kidney part.
The pain part.

392
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,497
HOUSE: Abdominal pain
plus all that stuff could
equal a pancreatic cyst.

393
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,767
Perfect. You managed to pick
the one symptom he never had,

394
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,932
abdominal pain.

395
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,873
It's the first symptom
on the board, "grunt."

396
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,207
Grunting isn't pathognomonic
for abdominal pain.

397
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,511
No, the traditional diagnostic
marker is compression
of the diaphragm,

398
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,381
vibration of the larynx,
leading to the audible sound,

399
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,852
"I have a pain in my abdomen."

400
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,981
Richard's symptoms are culled
from eight years
of medical history.

401
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:22,652
They're not patterned.
These are random,
individual events over time.

402
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,629
Illnesses have incubation
periods. Do an upper
endoscopic ultrasound.

403
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,097
His throat will collapse.

404
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,634
Muscle degeneration
in his neck won't
tolerate the scope.

405
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,465
It's an automatic trach.
You're talking about him

406
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,561
like he's an invalid.

407
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,696
We were insensitive.

408
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,800
Does he drool? Can he
hold his neck straight?
Does he choke on his food?

409
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,871
His neck's fine.
His throat's
not gonna collapse.

410
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,042
Cameron,
get consent from the wife.

411
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,548
Open.

412
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,761
I need you to swallow.

413
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,668
Sorry about that.

414
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,078
Here we go.

415
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,694
We're passing through
the lower esophageal sphincter

416
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,526
into the antrum
of the stomach.

417
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,362
There's the tail
of the pancreas.

418
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,630
Looks clean.

419
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,105
Moving medially. The body
and the head of the pancreas
look clean.

420
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,233
Get it out. Get it out.

421
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,972
It's stuck.
I can't move it.
His throat's collapsed.

422
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,271
(CHOKES)

423
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,074
His vitals are all over
the place. We're losing him.

424
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,683
Cutting.

425
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,120
We trached him, endoscopically
removed the probe,
and he's breathing again,

426
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,752
so, all in all, great idea.

427
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,853
Get a look at the pancreas
before the world ended?

428
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,023
It was clean.

429
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,588
Which means,
barring anything else,

430
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,794
meaning you,
he can go home tomorrow.

431
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,962
This man nearly died.
How can you discharge him?

432
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,199
His throat collapsed
because of what we predicted.

433
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,070
You stick something
down someone's throat,

434
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:21,738
they gag, spasm, which he did.
It took us a half an hour
to get the thing out.

435
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,043
Except our patient's throat
was sedated,

436
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,743
which means the brain
should have sent a signal
not to do anything.

437
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,182
This could be cancer
or some bizarre
neuro-degeneration,

438
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,661
even a new type of vascular...
Stop it. You're enjoying this.

439
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,761
I find it interesting.

440
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,264
It's interesting
only if you're right.

441
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,995
If you're wrong,
we're torturing this guy
to amuse you.

442
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,199
Half hour to remove the probe?

443
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,838
House.

444
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,570
It's not a spasm.

445
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,206
His throat didn't collapse.
It locked down.

446
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,182
The brain is supposed to tell
every muscle in the body
to relax and contract

447
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,514
at the same time.
This muscle was
only contracting,

448
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,679
which means the signal
from the brain
was not getting through.

449
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,656
There are no lesions
on his brain, nothing
to interrupt any orders.

450
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,090
All it takes is one wire down.

451
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,649
You have no evidence
of any wires down.

452
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:13,289
A few microtumors on
the meninges, and suddenly
you're choking to death.

453
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,758
You want to look at
the lining of his brain?

454
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,929
The amount of contrast
material you need to
pump up there just to see...

455
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,565
He'll bleed into his brain!
No, he won't.

456
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:27,476
Because that wouldn't be
interesting. You can get
permission this time.

457
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,682
HOUSE: The brain is enclosed
in a sack called the meninges.

458
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,743
Does this mean
the cancer's back?

459
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,913
No. No, no, no.
House.

460
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:48,323
If we found cancer, it
wouldn't be the original
cancer. It'd be new.

461
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,033
So, what, more surgery,
more radiation.

462
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,400
Might not be the worst thing.

463
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,233
If this isn't just ancient
history, then maybe it's
something we can correct.

464
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,141
Might even get some
brain function back.

465
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,405
He could get better?

466
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,642
No.

467
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,984
But understanding
what you're saying
will be nice.

468
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,495
Maybe you could figure out
ways to communicate.

469
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,826
Thank God he spoke to you.

470
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:28,237
Mrs. McNeil, the test to do
this is very risky.
He could die.

471
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,968
He's already dead.

472
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,692
<i>FOREMAN.: Chase, go slow.</i>

473
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,060
I've already injected it
into his spinal canal.

474
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,292
Next stop, his brain.

475
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,307
FOREMAN:
Contrast material entering
into the fourth ventricle.

476
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,900
No parenchymal bleeds.

477
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,674
CHASE: Blood pressure's high,
but it's holding.

478
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,141
Meninges are intact.
No bleeding.

479
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,187
Oh, God. Foreman, get in here.

480
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,439
Surgeon repaired the CSF leak.

481
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,909
You're lucky he didn't die.

482
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,173
I'm lucky?
He's the one who didn't die.

483
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,646
We told you he'd hemorrhage.

484
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,616
You told me he'd bleed
into his brain,
not out of his ear.

485
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,015
You've got to drop this.

486
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,815
We're missing something.

487
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:54,291
We did a dangerous test,
and something bad happened.
That's all this is.

488
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:59,853
Give me a tour of the brain,
Foreman.
Walk me through the scans.

489
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,032
1998, what happened?

490
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,670
Five-centimeter,
grade-four astrocytoma
between the parietal...

491
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:11,038
Nothing. Next?
The speck on the superior
temporal region.

492
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,770
It's a re-growth, benign.

493
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,812
The star thingy
next to the Rathke cleft?

494
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,471
Scar tissue from a biopsy.

495
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,413
House, every speck
is not a suspect.

496
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,249
It's years of surgeons
digging around in his head.
Let him go.

497
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:26,854
