1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,510
Dad wants us to pick
up where he left off

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,840
Saving people, hunting
things, the family business.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,860
Night, love.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,960
Hey, dean.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,820
Daddy!

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,880
Hey, buddy.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,090
Sammy?

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,570
Mary!

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,510
Dean, this is my girlfriend, jessica.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,680
Here's to sam and his
awesome lsat victory.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,930
What would I dowithout you?

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,340
Crash and burn.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,110
No!

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,460
I'm not gonna just ditch the job.

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,320
Screw the job, man.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,390
I'm sick of the job anyway.

17
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,570
I mean, we don't get paid.

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,740
We don't get thanked.

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,300
The only thing we get's bad luck.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,610
Yeah?

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,080
There's a cop car outside.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,270
You think it's for us?

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,910
I don't know.

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,470
I don't see how.

25
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,670
We ditched the plates, the credit cards.

26
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,490
They're leaving.

27
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,300
False alarm.

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,910
See?

29
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,700
Nothing to worry about.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,060
Yeah, being fugitives is
a freaking dance party.

31
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,510
Hey, man, chicks dig the danger vibe.

32
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,460
So, you got anything yet?

33
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,070
Are you kidding me?

34
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,650
How could I?

35
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,270
You got me sifting through 50
square miles of real estate.

36
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,760
Well, that's where all
the victims disappeared.

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,250
Yeah, well, I got diddly-Squat.

38
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:22,860
What about you?

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,010
Just one thing --I'm
pretty sure of it now.

40
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,190
We're hunting a jinn.

41
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,420
A freaking jinni?

42
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,900
Yep.

43
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,000
You think these suckers
can really grant wishes?

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,530
I don't know.

45
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,370
I guess they're powerful enough, but not
exactly like barbara eden in harem pants.

46
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,780
Jinn have been feeding
off people for centuries.

47
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,280
They're all over the koran.

48
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,440
My god.

49
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,990
Barbara eden was hot, wasn't she?

50
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,870
And way hotterthan
that "bewitched" chick.

51
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,180
Are you even listening to me?

52
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,720
Yeah.

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,280
So, where do the jinn slair up?

54
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,210
Ruins, usually.

55
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,190
Bigger the better -More places to hide.

56
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,000
I saw a place a couple milesback.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,650
I'm gonna check it out.

58
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,510
Wait.No, no, no.

59
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,170
Come pick me up first.

60
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,030
No, I'm sure it's nothing.

61
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,320
I just want to take a look around.

62
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,460
Dean?

63
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,450
Sam.

64
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,170
What's going on?

65
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,730
I don't know.

66
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,590
I don't know where I am.

67
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,680
What?

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,420
What happened?

69
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,490
Well, the jinn -It attacked me.

70
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,300
The gin?

71
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,780
You're drinking gin?

72
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,170
No, ass-Hat, the jinn,
the scary creature.

73
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,130
Remember?

74
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,660
It put its hand on me, and then
I woke up next to some hot chick.

75
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,080
Who -Carmen?

76
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,990
Who?

77
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,750
Dean, you're drunk.

78
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,710
You're drunk-Dialing me.

79
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,380
I am not drunk.

80
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,210
Quit screwing around.

81
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,040
Look, it's late.

82
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,700
Just get some sleep, and
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

83
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,290
Wait, sam!

84
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,310
Sam!

85
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,000
"CRIMINAL LAW & PROCEDURE"

86
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,380
Lawrence?

87
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
What the hell?

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,730
Honey?

89
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,030
What are you doing up?

90
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,360
Hey.

91
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,200
Carmen.

92
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,600
Carmen, uh, I just, uh
oh, you can't sleep, huh?

93
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,380
Yeah.

94
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,430
Well, why don't you come back to bed, and
let's see if I can do anything to help.

95
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,730
Sure.

96
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,060
Yeah.

97
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:20,820
In a minute.

98
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,940
You go ahead.

99
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,060
Okay.

100
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,950
Don't stay up too long.

101
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,210
No.

102
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,590
Dean.

103
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,320
Mom?

104
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,180
What are you doing here?

105
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,510
Are you all right?

106
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,170
I don't know.

107
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,920
Well, come inside.

108
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,280
Carmen just called and said you
just took off all of a sudden.

109
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,440
Carmen?

110
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,650
Right.

111
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,440
Let me ask you a question.

112
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,180
When I was a kid, what did you
always tell me when you put me to bed?

113
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,360
I don't understand -Just
answer the question.

114
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,820
I told you angels
were watching over you.

115
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,420
I don't believe it.

116
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,780
Honey, you're scaring me.

117
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,100
Now, just tell mewhat's going on.

118
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,140
You don't think that wishes
can -Can really  -What?

119
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,500
Forget it.

120
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,500
Forget it.

121
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,740
I'm just --I'm
happy to see you.

122
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,960
That's all.

123
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,500
You're beautiful.

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,370
What?

125
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,040
Hey, when I was young,
was there ever a fire here?

126
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,020
No, never.

127
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,890
I thought there was.

128
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,100
I guess I was wrong.

129
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,400
Dad's on a softball team.

130
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,370
Dad's softball team
--That's -That's funny to me.

131
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,810
He loved that stupid team.

132
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,990
Dad's dead?

133
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,230
And the thing that killed him was A...

134
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,780
A stroke.

135
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,480
He died in his sleep.

136
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,740
You know that.

137
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,850
That's great.

138
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,260
Excuse me?

139
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,020
That's great that he went peacefully.

140
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,940
I mean, it --It sure
beats the alternative.

141
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,500
You've been drinking.

142
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,200
No, I haven't, mom.

143
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,690
I'm gonna call carmen and have
her come pick you up, okay?

144
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,490
Wait, no, no.

145
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:06,990
Don't do that.

146
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,420
Don't do that.

147
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,250
I want to stay here.

148
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,740
Why?

149
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,470
Because I miss the place.

150
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,590
It's okay.

151
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,850
You got to bed, okay?

152
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,470
Are you sureyou're all right?

153
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,160
I think so.

154
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,200
Okay.

155
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,440
Get some rest.

156
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,570
I love you.

157
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,390
Me too.

158
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,670
Hey, it's me.

159
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,170
I can't get to the phone right now.

160
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,390
Well, I don't think I've
seen you in my class before.

161
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,630
Are you kidding me?

162
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,640
I love your lectures.

163
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,850
You --You make
learning fun.

164
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,730
So, what can I do for you?

165
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,870
What can you tell me about jinns?

166
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,880
A lot of muslims believe
the jinn are very real.

167
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,040
They're mentioned in the koran  yeah,
yeah, yeah, get to the wish part.

168
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,080
What about it?

169
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,600
Do you think they can really do it?

170
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,280
Uh, no.

171
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,770
No, I don't think they can really do it.

172
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,260
You understandthese
are mythic creatures.

173
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,050
Yeah, no, I know.

174
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,080
I know.

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,550
But I mean in the stories -Say you had a
wish, but you never even said it out loud,

176
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,670
Like that a loved one never died or
that something awful never happened.

177
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,380
Supposedly, yes.

178
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,140
I mean, they have godlike power.

179
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,330
They can alter reality however
they want -Past, present, future.

180
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,190
Why would the jinn do it?

181
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,030
What, self-Defense?

182
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,950
Or maybe it's not really evil.

183
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,190
Son?

184
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,260
You been drinking?

185
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,780
Everybody keeps asking
me that, but, uh, no.

186
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,850
Who'd have thought, baby?

187
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,720
We're civilians.

188
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,500
This is the best sandwich ever!

189
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,720
Thank you.

190
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,580
I tried to get aholdof sam earlier.

191
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,060
Where is he?

192
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,280
Uh, he'll be here soon.

193
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,540
Good.

194
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm dying to see him.

195
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,770
Sweetie, I-I
--Don't get me wrong.

196
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,950
I am thrilled you are hanging out here all of
a sudden, but, uh, shouldn't you be at work?

197
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,710
Work?

198
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,430
At the garage?

199
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,160
Right.

200
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,550
The garage.

201
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,330
That's where I work.Yeah.

202
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,720
No, I-I-I've
got the day off.

203
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,710
Good thing.

204
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,790
That lawn looks like it
could use some mowing.

205
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,530
You want to mow the lawn?

206
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,250
Are you kidding me?

207
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,560
I'd love to mow the lawn.

208
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,710
Knock yourself out.

209
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,090
You'd think you've never
mowed a lawn in your life.

210
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,670
I don't believe it.

211
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,860
Jessica.

212
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,990
Good to see you, too, dean.

213
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,270
I can't breathe, okay?

214
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,200
Sammy.

215
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,470
Hey, look at you.

216
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,710
You're with jessica.

217
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,830
I don't believe it.

218
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,700
Yeah.

219
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,120
Where'd you guys come from?

220
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,040
We just flew infrom california.

221
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,230
California.

222
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,590
Stanford, huh?

223
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,000
Law school, I bet.

224
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,950
I see you started off mom's
birthday with a bang, as usual.

225
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,450
Wait.

226
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,390
Mom's birthday
--That's today?

227
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,840
Yeah, yeah, dean, that's today.

228
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,300
That's why we're here.

229
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,040
Don't tell me you forgot.

230
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,680
Well...

231
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,750
That looks awesome.

232
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,370
All right.

233
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,640
To mom.

234
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,230
Happy birthday.

235
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,120
Happy birthday.

236
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,360
Thank you.

237
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I was really worried
about youlast night.

238
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,130
Oh, I'm good.

239
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,490
I'm really good.

240
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,930
Okay.

241
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,600
What do you say later we
get you a cheeseburger?

242
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,910
Oh, god, yes.

243
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,130
How did I end up with such a cool chick?

244
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,930
I just got low standards.

245
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:51,770
All right.

246
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,910
Jess and I actually have another
surprise for mom's birthday.

247
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,180
Uh, you want to tell them?

248
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,400
They're your family.

249
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,930
All right.

250
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,410
What?

251
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,740
Tell me what?

252
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,110
Oh, my god!

253
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,710
That's so wonderful. Thank you.

254
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,690
Congratulations.

255
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,130
I just wish your dad were here.

256
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,070
Yeah, me, too.

257
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,020
Congratulations, sammy.

258
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,780
Thanks.

259
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,650
I'm really gladyou're happy.

260
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,060
So, dean, what was all
that back at the restaurant?

261
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,420
Oh, I thought I saw someone.

262
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,690
I'm sure it's nothing.

263
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,590
Well, I had a lovely birthday.

264
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,830
Thank you.

265
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,470
Good night.

266
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,500
Night.

267
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,720
Yeah, well, I'm beat.

268
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,520
Ready to turn in?

269
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,650
Sure.

270
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,060
Night, guys.

271
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,390
Wait a second.

272
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,900
Come on.It's not even 9:00 yet.

273
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,750
Let's go have a drink or something.

274
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,170
Yeah.Yeah, maybe another time.

275
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:19,980
Come on, man.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,120
Look at us, huh?

277
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,800
We both have beautiful
women on our arms.

278
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,840
You're engaged.

279
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,540
Let's go celebrate.

280
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,390
Guys, can you excuse us?

281
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,890
I want to talk to my brother for a sec.

282
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,320
Sure.

283
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,550
Thanks.

284
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,660
Come on, carmen.

285
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,530
Come here.

286
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,310
What?

287
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,030
Okay.

288
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,550
What's gotten into you?

289
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,580
What do you mean?

290
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,320
I mean this whole warm,
fuzzy, ecstasy-Trip thing.

291
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,950
I'm just happy for you, sammy.

292
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,670
Yeah, right.That's another thing.

293
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,740
Since when do you call me "sammy"?

294
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,700
Dean, come on.

295
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,990
We don't talk outside of holidays.

296
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,320
We don't?

297
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,980
Well, we should.

298
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,130
I mean, you're my brother.

299
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,960
"You're my brother"?

300
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,530
Yeah.

301
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:14,800
That's what you said when you snaked my atm card or when you
bailed on my graduation or when you hooked up with rachel nave.

302
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,890
Who?

303
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,570
Uh, my prom date
--On prom night.

304
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,120
Yeah, that doeskind of sound like me.

305
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,610
Well, hey, man, I'm
sorry about all that.

306
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,090
No, look, it's all right, man.

307
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,790
I just -You know, I'm
not asking you to change.

308
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,580
I just, uh
--I don't know.

309
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,400
I guess we just don't really
have anything in common, you know?

310
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,890
Wait.

311
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,570
Yes, we do.

312
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,600
Yes, we do.

313
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,880
What?

314
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,960
Hunting.

315
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,370
Hunting?

316
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,050
I've never been hunting
in my life, dean.

317
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,260
Yeah, well, then we should go sometime.

318
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,500
I think you'd be great at it.

319
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,760
Get some rest.

320
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,650
My favorite.

321
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,920
I guess you know me pretty well.

322
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,330
Afraid so.

323
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,450
You all right?

324
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,160
Sammy and I --We
don't get along.

325
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,890
Well, you don't really
spend a lot of time together.

326
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,140
I just think you don't know
each other all that well.

327
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,210
For the record, he doesn't
know what he's missing.

328
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,050
I can fix things with sam.

329
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,350
I can make it up to him...

330
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,550
To everyone.

331
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,770
Okay.

332
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,580
What's gotten into you lately?

333
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,100
This isn't gonna make
a lick of sense to you.

334
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,560
But I kind of feel likeI've
been given a second chance.

335
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,310
And I don'twant to waste it.

336
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,630
You're right.

337
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,610
It doesn't make any sense.

338
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,310
You know, I get it.

339
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,610
Get what?

340
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,250
Why you're the one.

341
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,510
Well?

342
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,750
Whatever's gotten into you, I like it.

343
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,200
Oh, come on!

344
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,440
Don't do this to me now.

345
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,310
I've got to get ready for work.

346
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,310
You got to work now?

347
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,940
I told you.

348
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,220
I've got the night shift on thursday.

349
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,750
You work night sat the, uh......

350
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,950
Hospital.

351
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,710
I'm dating a nurse.

352
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,630
That is so respectable.

353
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,880
The olive oil must have a purpose here.

354
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,280
Yeah.

355
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,840
Yeah?

356
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,970
I'll take the olive oil, and we'll
put just a touch of olive oil in, okay?

357
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,860
That's all.

358
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,740
Can't make any mistakes
with this machine.

359
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,400
Now, for liquid, I could use water, but
I'm gonna use a little spinach jui-1%.

360
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,140
No.

361
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,940
Why I said the child nee

362
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,560
And today marks the anniversary of the
crash of united britannia flight 424.

363
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,690
Indianapolis residents held a candlelight vigil in memory
of the 108 passengers and crew who lost their lives.

364
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,930
Oh, no.I stopped that crash.

365
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,570
All of them...

366
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,720
Everyone that you saved,
everyone sammy and I saved......

367
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,360
They're all dead.

368
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,420
And there's this woman
that's haunting me.

369
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,830
I don't know why.

370
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,540
I don't know what the
connection is -Not yet, anyway.

371
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,920
It's like my old life is coming after me or
something, like it doesn't want me to be happy.

372
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,990
Of course, I know what you'd say.

373
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,470
Well, not the you that played softball,
but you'd say, "go hunt the jinn."

374
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,340
It put you here.

375
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,460
It can put you back.

376
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,300
Your happiness or all those
people's lives -No contest."

377
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,780
Right?

378
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,990
But why?

379
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,790
Why is it my job to save these people?

380
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,240
Why do I have to be some kind of hero?

381
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,480
What about us, huh?

382
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,300
What, mom's not supposed
to live her life?

383
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,410
Sammy's not supposed to get married?

384
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,970
Why do we have to
sacrifice everything, dad?

385
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,980
It'S...

386
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,810
Yeah.

387
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,170
That was so easy I'm
embarrassed for you.

388
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,460
Dean?

389
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,880
What the hell are you doing here?

390
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,010
I was looking for a beer.

391
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,860
In the china cabinet?

392
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,380
That's mom's silver.

393
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,000
Sam.

394
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,100
What, you broke into the
house to steal mom's silver?

395
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,590
It's not what it looks like, okay?

396
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,360
I didn't have a choice.

397
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,800
Oh, really?

398
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,330
Why?

399
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,580
What's so damn important that you
got to steal from your own mother?

400
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,020
You want the truth?

401
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,080
Yeah.

402
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,230
Yeah, I do.

403
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,900
I owe somebody money.

404
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,790
Who?

405
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,680
A bookie.

406
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,040
I lost big on a game.

407
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,100
I got to bring him the cash tonight.

408
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,030
I can't believe we're even related.

409
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,970
Sam, I'm sorry.

410
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,280
I'm sorry that we don't get along.

411
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,430
And I wish to hell I
could stay and fix it.

412
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,090
But I got to do this.

413
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,930
People's lives depend on it.

414
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,710
What are you talking about, dean?

415
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,390
Nothing.

416
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,800
Forget it.Just, uh...

417
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,760
Hey, tell mom I love her.

418
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,120
Dean.

419
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,040
I'll see you, sammy.

420
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,390
Get out of the car.

421
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,240
I'm going with you.

422
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,280
You're just gonna slow me down.

423
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,840
Tough.

424
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,160
This is dangerous,
and you could get hurt.

425
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,030
And so could you.

426
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,630
Sam

427
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,190
Look, whatever stupid thing you're about to
do, you're not doing it alone, and that's that.

428
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,100
I don't understand.

429
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,560
Why are you doing this?

430
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,030
Because you're still my brother.

431
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,830
Bitch.

432
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,240
W-What are you calling mea bitch for?

433
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,770
You're supposed to say "jerk."

434
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,250
What?

435
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,310
Never mind.

436
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,790
What's in the bag?

437
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,950
Nothing.

438
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,120
Nothing?

439
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,180
Yeah, nothing.

440
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,970
Fine.

441
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,610
You don't want to do that.

442
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,720
Oh, really?

443
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,600
What the hell is this?

444
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,440
Blood.

445
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,520
Yeah, I can see that it's blood.

446
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,400
What the hell is it doing in here?

447
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,020
You don't really want to know.

448
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,030
No, I do really want to know.

449
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,380
I really, really do.

450
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,100
Well, you're gonna find
out sooner or later.

451
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,720
I needed a silver knife
dipped in lamb's blood.

452
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,940
You needed a silver knife
dipped in lamb's blood.

453
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,330
Why?

454
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,170
Because there's this creature,
a jinn, and I have to hunt it.

455
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,840
Okay, um, stop the car.

456
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,610
I know how it sounds.

457
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,190
Great.

458
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,600
Just stop the car.

459
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,260
It's the truth, sam.

460
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,820
There are things out there in the dark.

461
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,540
There are bad things.

462
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,470
There arenightmare things.

463
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,420
And people have to be saved, and if
we don't save them, then nobody will.

464
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,170
I want to help you.

465
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,570
I really, really do.

466
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:42,550
But you're having some kind of
psychotic breakdown, so I just  I wish.

467
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,590
What the hell was that, dean?

468
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,650
That was my phone.

469
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm not going to a rubber room,
sammy, and we got work to do.

470
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,950
I was just tryingto help you out, dean.

471
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,270
I don't want youto get yourself hurt.

472
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,030
You protect me?

473
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,700
Yeah!

474
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,150
Oh, that's hilarious.

475
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,800
Why don't you just sit tight and
try not to get us both killed?

476
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,680
Where are we?

477
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,010
Well, we're not in kansas anymore.

478
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,660
Illinois.

479
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,010
And you thinksomething's in there?

480
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,150
I know it is.

481
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,260
See?

482
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,460
There's nothing here, dean.

483
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,940
Look, carmen's got to be
worried sick about you, dean.

484
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,640
Come on.

485
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,680
Let's just go.

486
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,150
What the hell is that?

487
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,450
Stick behind me and
keep your mouth shut.

488
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,830
What the hell?

489
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,340
It's her.

490
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,310
Dean, what's going on?

491
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,570
Where's my dad?

492
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,790
No.

493
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,070
No.

494
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,380
Where's my dad?

495
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,300
Sleep.

496
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Sleep.

497
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,500
This is real?

498
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,960
You're not crazy?

499
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,450
She didn't know where she was.

500
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,170
She thought she was with her father.

501
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,900
What if that's what the jinn does?

502
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,210
It doesn't grant you a wish.

503
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,560
It just makes you think it has.

504
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,700
Look, man, that thing
could come back, all right?

505
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,400
Dean, please.

506
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,240
What if I'm like her?

507
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,110
What if I'm tied up in here some place?

508
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,830
What if all this is in my head?

509
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,930
I mean, it could, you know

510
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,830
Maybe it gives us some kind of supernatural
acid and then just feeds on us slow.

511
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,310
No, dean, that doesn't make sense, okay?

512
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,350
What if that's why she
keeps appearing to me?

513
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,400
She's not a spirit.

514
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,700
It's like more and more I'm catching
flashes of reality -You know,

515
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,890
Like I'm in here somewhere, I'm catatonic, and I'm
taking all this stuffin, but I can't snap out of it.

516
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,150
Okay.Look.Yeah, you're right.

517
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,270
I was wrong.

518
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,430
You're not crazy, but we
need to get out of here fast.

519
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,730
I don't think you're real.

520
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,430
Did you feel that?

521
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,360
You feel this?

522
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,090
I'm real.

523
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,320
This is not an acid trip.

524
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,610
I'm real, and that thing is gonna
come down here and kill us for real.

525
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,240
Now, please.

526
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,540
There's one way to be sure.

527
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,420
What are you doing?

528
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,820
It's an old wives' tale.

529
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,850
If you're about to die in
a dream, you'll wake up.

530
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,430
No, no, no.

531
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,790
That's crazy, all right?

532
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,870
Maybe.

533
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:18,100
You're gonna kill yours
or I'm gonna wake up.

534
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,940
One or the other.

535
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,780
Look, this isn't a dream, all right?

536
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm here with you now, and you
are about to kill yourself, dean.

537
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,890
No, I'm pretty sure......

538
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,010
Like 90% sure, but I'm sure enough.

539
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,290
Wait!

540
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,450
Why'd youhave to keep digging?

541
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,060
Why couldn't you have
left well enough alone?

542
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,640
You were happy.

543
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,040
Put the knife down, honey.

544
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,570
You're not real.

545
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,300
None of it is.

546
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,100
It doesn't matter.

547
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,090
It's still better than anything you had.

548
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,740
What?

549
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,460
It's everything you want.

550
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,330
We're a family again.

551
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,500
Let's go home.

552
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,850
I'll die.

553
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,390
The jinn will drain the life
out of me in a couple of days.

554
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:41,810
But in here, with us, it'll
feel like years, like a lifetime.

555
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,460
I promise.

556
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,480
No more pain, no more fear.

557
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,450
Just love and comfort and safety.

558
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,700
Dean...

559
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,450
Stay with us.

560
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,440
Get some rest.

561
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,920
You don't have to
worryabout sam anymore.

562
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,140
You get to watch him live a full life.

563
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,330
We can have a future
together, have our own family.

564
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,810
I love you, dean.

565
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,870
Please.

566
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,280
Why is it our job to save everyone?

567
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,490
Haven't we done enough?

568
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm begging you.

569
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,060
Give me the knife.

570
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,900
I'm sorry.

571
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,710
Dean!

572
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,500
Dean!

573
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,490
Dean.

574
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,230
Oh, god.

575
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,950
Come on.

576
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,780
Hey, wake up.

577
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,990
Wake up, damn it.

578
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,730
Auntie em.

579
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,980
There's no place like home.

580
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,330
Thank god.

581
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,660
I thought I lost youfor a second.

582
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,010
You almost did.

583
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,610
Oh, god.

584
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,990
Let's get you down.

585
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,030
Sam!

586
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,840
She's still alive.

587
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,160
Sam.

588
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:57,980
I got you.

589
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,050
I got you.

590
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,600
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

591
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,090
I got you.

592
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,940
I got you.

593
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,810
Okay.

594
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,890
Uh, well, thank you
so much for the update.

595
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,390
Okay, bye.

596
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,520
That was the hospital.

597
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,090
The girl's been stabilized.

598
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,790
Good chance she's gonna pull through.

599
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,360
That's good.

600
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,480
Yeah.

601
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,840
How about you?

602
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,020
You all right?

603
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,750
Yeah, I'm all right.

604
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,050
You should have seen it, sam.

605
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,020
Our lives.

606
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,910
You were such a wussy.

607
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,370
So, we didn't get along, then, huh?

608
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,690
No.

609
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,170
Yeah.

610
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,370
I thought it was supposed
to be this perfect fantasy.

611
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,500
It wasn'T.

612
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,690
It was just a wish.

613
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,570
I wished for mom to live.

614
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,830
Mom never died, we never went hunting,
and you and me just never, uh -You know.

615
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,350
Yeah.

616
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,020
Well, I'm glad we do.

617
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,390
And I'm glad you dug yourself out, dean.

618
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,180
Mo st people wouldn't
have had the strength.

619
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,370
They would've stayed.

620
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,030
Yeah, lucky me.

621
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,800
I got to tell you,
though, man -You had jess.

622
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,350
Mom was gonna have grandkids.

623
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:46,190
Yeah, but, dean, it wasn't real.

624
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,400
I know.

625
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,200
But I wanted to stay.

626
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,980
I wanted to stay so bad.

627
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,640
I mean, ever since dad...

628
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,530
All I can think aboutis
how much this job's cost us.

629
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,780
We've lost so much.

630
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,520
And we've sacrificedso much.

631
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,290
But people are alivebecause of you.

632
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,040
It's worth it, dean.

633
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,880
It is.

634
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,490
It's not fair, and, you know, it
hurts like hell, but it's worth it.
