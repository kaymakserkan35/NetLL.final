1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,200
Then...

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,100
Lilith is trying to break the
66 seals To free Lucifer from hell.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,600
Lucifer will bring the apocalypse.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,100
- Mom.
- Sam, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,100
For what?

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,900
Does this mean I
have demon blood in me?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,600
I don't want to be
the freak for once, Dean.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,200
I want to be normal.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,200
your brother is headed
down a dangerous road, Dean.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,100
do you even know how far
Off the reservation you've gone?

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,300
How far from normal, from human?

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,700
If I didn't know you,
I would want to hunt you.

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,800
You want to know if I know
about the demon blood.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
you didn't tell Dean?

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
Where the hell are you, Ruby?

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm all out. Call me. I need more.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,500
This is for your own good.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,300
Guys?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,300
Hey -- Guys, this isn't funny!

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,600
Hey!

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,200
now

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Okay. Let me out.
This is not funny.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,300
Damn straight.

24
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Dean. Come on, this is crazy.

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,400
No. Not until you dry out.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,500
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have lied to you.

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,200
Just...open the door.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,600
You don't have to apologize.
It's not your fault.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,200
It's not your fault that you
lied to me Over and over again.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,200
- I get it now. You couldn't help it.
- I'm not some junkie!

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
Really?

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,000
I guess I've just imagined How
strung out you've been lately.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,600
You're actually trying to twist this

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
Into some kind of ridiculous
drug intervention?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
If it smells like a duck.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,100
Dean, I'm not drinking
the demon blood for kicks.

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm getting strong
enough to kill Lilith.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
- Strong?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,300
It's about as far away
from strong As you can get.

40
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,000
Try weak. Try desperate. Pathetic.

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,300
Killing Lilith is what matters.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,700
Or are you so busy being
self-Righteous You forgot about her?

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,500
Oh, Lilith's gonna die.

44
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Bobby and I will kill her.

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,600
- But not with you.
- You're not serious.

46
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,700
Congrats, Sammy.

47
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,400
You just bought yourself a
benchwarmer seat To the apocalypse.

48
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
Dean. No, wait.

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,000
Come back here!

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,100
Dean! Let me out of here!

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,300
Dean! Let me out of here!

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Let me out! Dean!

Guys! Get down here!
Something's coming!

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Hello, Sam.

58
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,700
It's a pleasure to see you again.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,600
And looks like I have
you all to myself here.

60
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,200
Goodness.

61
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,600
How will we pass the time?

62
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,200
Don't. No, no, don't. Don't.

63
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Ah, don't.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,900
Don't! Stop!

65
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Alastair... ohh! Please! Please.

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,700
So polite all of a sudden.

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Very nice.

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,000
I appreciate that.

69
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,100
Hmm?

70
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,900
No, no, no.

71
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,400
Aah! No! Please! Please! Please!

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,900
Stop!

73
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,800
How long is this gonna go on?

74
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,100
Here, let me look it up
in my demon-detox manual.

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, wait. No one ever wrote one.

76
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,800
No telling how long it'll take.

77
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,600
Hell, or if Sam
will even live through it.

78
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Hello?

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,700
Suck dirt and die, Rufus.
You call me again, I'll kill you.

80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,700
- What's up with Rufus?
- He knows.

81
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,900
I'm busy, you sumbitch.
This better be important.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,300
No! No!

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,400
The answer's "yes."
You're hallucinating.

84
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,700
That's right. It's me.

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,900
Or, I mean, it's you.

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm losing my mind.

87
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,100
Definitely.

88
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,900
What do you want?

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,900
An explanation.
How could you do this to me?

90
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,400
I thought we were
gonna be normal.

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,900
I tried. I did.

92
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,600
It didn't pan out that way.

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,700
Sorry, kid.

94
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,700
"Sorry, kid"?

95
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,900
That's what you have to say?
It's all we ever wanted.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,700
We were so close!

97
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,200
Y-You got away from dad.
You quit hunting.

98
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,700
You were gonna become
a lawyer and get married.

99
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,100
- Why did you blow it?!
- Look!

100
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,000
They killed Jessica.

101
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,400
Yeah. And if you hadn't
run off with Dean,

102
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,600
If you'd been there to protect her,
She'd still be alive.

103
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,200
I know.

104
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,800
Think Jess would want
you to turn into this?

105
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
She loved you.

106
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,300
You think she would be happy
You using her as an excuse?

107
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,400
I am.

109
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,500
But life doesn't turn out
the way you thought it would

110
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,300
When you were 14 years old.

111
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,400
We were never gonna be normal.
We were never gonna get away.

112
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,100
Grow up.

113
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,600
Maybe you're right.

114
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,900
Maybe there's... no escape.

115
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,100
After all...

116
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,500
how can you run
from what's inside you?

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,600
The news. And the news ain't good.

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,900
This is what Rufus called about?

119
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,600
"Key west sees 10 species go extinct"?

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,400
Yep. Plus, Alaska --
15-Man fishing crew,

121
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
All stricken blind -- Cause unknown.

122
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,700
New York -- Teacher goes postal,
locks the door,

123
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
Kills exactly 66 kids.

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,900
All this in a single day?

125
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,400
I looked them up.
There's no doubt about it.

126
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,800
They're all seals.
Breaking -- Fast.

127
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,100
- How many are left?
- Who knows? Can't be many.

128
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,800
Where the hell
are your angel pals?

129
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,000
You tell me.

130
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,500
I'm just wondering...

131
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,800
what?

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,100
With the apocalypse being nigh and all,

133
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,600
Is now really the right time to be
Having this little domestic drama of ours?

134
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
What do you mean?

135
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Well, I don't like this
any more than you do, but...

136
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,500
Sam can kill demons.

137
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,500
He's got a shot
at stopping Armageddon.

138
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,100
So, what, sacrifice Sam's life,
his soul, For the greater good?

139
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Is that what you're saying?

140
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,000
Times are bad, so let's use
Sam as a nuclear warhead?

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Look, I know you hate
me for suggesting it.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,300
I hate me for suggesting it.

143
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,700
I love that boy like a son.

144
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,100
All I'm saying is,
maybe he's here right now

145
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,500
Instead of on the battlefield,

146
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
'Cause we love him too much.

147
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,300
poor baby.

148
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,100
mom!

149
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,100
Mom!

150
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,800
Sam.

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,500
You look just awful.

152
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,700
Let's hear it.

153
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,000
Go ahead.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,300
What do you mean?

155
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
You're disappointed.

156
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,100
You never thought I'd...

157
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,700
...turn out this way.

158
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm a...

159
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,400
Pisspoor excuse
for a son.

160
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,700
Your heart is broken.

161
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,600
Am I close?

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,300
Not at all.

163
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,300
You're doing
the right thing, Sam.

164
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,900
What you're doing
is brave.

165
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
You're not being crazy.
You're being practical.

166
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,400
Sam,
I am so proud of you.

167
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,400
But...

168
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,200
But...Dean.

169
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,400
Your brother
doesn't understand.

170
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,500
I was raised a hunter,
from a long line.

171
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,700
We understand that there are
gonna be hard choices.

172
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,400
And we do what we have to
to get the job done.

173
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,700
Yes,
our family is cursed.

174
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,900
But you...

175
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,800
You have the power
to turn it into a gift.

176
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,300
You can use it
against them.

177
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
For revenge?

178
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,800
No, for justice.

179
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,100
I know how scared
you are.

180
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,700
What's...

181
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,100
In me...

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,200
Mom?

183
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,500
- It's...
- evil.

184
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
And you know it.

185
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,000
What if it's stronger
than me?

186
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
Look at me.

187
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,200
What if Dean's right?

188
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,700
Dean can never know
how strong you are...

189
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,600
...because Dean is weak.

190
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,800
Look at what he's done
to you.

191
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,000
Locking you in here?
He's terrified.

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,900
He's in over his head.

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,100
You have to go on
without him.

194
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,600
You have what it takes.

195
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,500
- You have to kill Lilith.
- Even if it kills me.

196
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,000
Make my death
mean something.

197
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,700
I'm counting on you,
Sam.

198
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,900
Don't let anyone or anything
get in your way.

199
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,400
Not even Dean.

200
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Well, it's about time.

201
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
I've been screaming myself hoarse
out here For about 21/2 hours now.

202
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,900
What do you want?

203
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,400
Well, you can start With what
the hell happened in Illinois.

204
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,100
What do you mean?

205
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,100
Cut the crap. You were
gonna tell me something.

206
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Well,
nothing of import.

207
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,300
You got ass-Reamed
in heaven.

208
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,600
- But it was not "of import"?
- Dean.

209
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,300
I can't.

210
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,200
Get to the reason
you really called me.

212
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,900
It's about Sam, right?

213
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,100
Can he do it?

214
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,000
Kill Lilith,
stop the apocalypse?

215
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Possibly, yes.

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,900
But as you know,

217
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,000
He'd have to take
certain steps.

218
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Crank up
the hell-Blood regimen.

219
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,700
Consuming the amount of blood it would take to
kill Lilith Would change your brother forever.

220
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Most likely,

221
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,200
he would become the next creature
That you would feel compelled to kill.

222
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,700
There's no reason this would
have to come to pass, Dean.

223
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
We believe it's you,
Dean,

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,700
Not your brother.

225
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,100
The only question for us is
Whether you're willing to accept it.

226
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,500
Stand up
and accept your role.

227
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,800
You are the one
who will stop it.

228
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,100
If I do this...

229
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,500
Sammy doesn't have to?

230
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,400
If it gives you comfort
to see it that way.

231
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
God,
you're a dick these days.

232
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,400
Fine. I'm in.

233
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,100
You give yourself over wholly
To the service of god and his angels?

234
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,800
Yeah. Exactly.

235
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,200
Say it.

236
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,200
I give myself over wholly
To serve god...

237
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,900
And you guys.

238
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
You swear to follow
his will

239
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,800
And his word as swiftly And obediently
as you did your own father's?

240
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,600
Yes. I swear.

241
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,600
Now what?

242
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,300
Now you wait.

243
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,500
And we call on you
when it's time.

244
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,100
Guys! Help!

245
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,300
Now, correct me
if I'm wrong, But

246
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,200
you willingly signed up
to be the angels' bitch?

247
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sorry.
You prefer "sucker"?

248
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
After everything you said
about them, Now you trust them?

249
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,500
Come on, give me
a little credit, Bobby.

250
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,100
I've never trusted
them less.

251
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,400
I mean, they come on like
shady politicians From planet Vulcan!

252
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,500
- Well, then why in the hell --
- Because what other option do I have?!

253
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,800
It's either trust the angels,
or let Sammy trust a demon?!

254
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
I see your point.

255
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,400
Do you hear that?

256
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,700
That's a little
too much nothing.

257
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,000
What if he's faking?

258
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
You really think
he would?

259
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,800
I think
he'd do anything.

260
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,200
That ain't faking.

261
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
We're gonna have to tie
him down For his own safety.

262
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,500
Dean? You with me?

263
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,000
Dean!
Before he has another fit!

264
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
Yeah, yeah!
Let's just get it over with!

265
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,100
We had to.

266
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,100
The demon blood was flinging you
all over the room.

267
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,500
Tell me something, Sam.
Why did you do this to yourself?

268
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,400
You know why.

269
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Right.

270
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,900
"Kill Lilith."
The big excuse.

271
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,800
But why?

272
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,800
What, revenge?
Right?

273
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,800
Of course.

274
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,700
Revenge for what?
For sending me to hell?

275
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,200
Did you happen to notice
I'm back? Alive and kicking.

276
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,700
- So what's the point?
- The point?

277
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,900
How about stop
the damn apocalypse?

278
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,100
My gig!
Not yours!

279
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,600
The angels said so,
remember?

280
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,400
God picked me, man.

281
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,800
so, have you got any other
fantastic excuses?

282
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,500
Hmm?

283
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm gonna ask one more time.

284
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,200
Are we absolutely sure
we're doing the right thing?

285
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Bobby, you saw what was
happening to him down there.

286
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,000
The demon blood
is killing him.

287
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,000
No, it isn't.
We are.

288
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
- What?
- I'm sorry.

289
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,900
I can't bite my tongue
any longer. We're killing him.

290
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Keeping him locked up down there.
This "cold turkey" thing isn't working.

291
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,700
If -- If he doesn't get
what he needs...

292
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,300
soon...

293
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,900
Sam's not gonna last
much longer.

294
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,200
No.

295
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm not giving him demon blood.
I won't do it.

296
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,000
- And if he dies?
- Then at least he dies human!

297
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,100
I know why you really drink
that blood, Sam.

298
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Just leave me alone.

299
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,700
Makes you feel strong.
Invincible.

300
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,400
A big bad wolf
in a world of little pigs.

301
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,800
No. You're wrong, Dean.

302
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,000
It's more than that,
isn't it?

303
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,300
It's because your whole life,
you felt different.

304
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,800
Am I right?

305
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,500
Stop.

306
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,600
Oh, I hit a little close
to home, huh?

307
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,000
Not different because
you were some...

308
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,200
lonely kid Or because
of your weirdo family.

309
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,700
Stop it.

310
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,600
- Because you're
a monster.
- Shut up!

311
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,300
- Just shut the hell up!
- You were always a monster.

312
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,600
And you only feel right When
you're sucking down more poison

313
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,800
And more evil!

314
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,200
I would die for him
in a second.

315
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,800
But I won't let him do this
to himself.

316
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,100
I can't.

317
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,200
I guess I found my line.

318
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,800
I won't let my brother
turn into a monster.

319
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,500
- Monster, Sam.
You're a monster.
- Dean, no.

320
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,500
I tried so hard to pretend
that we were brothers,

321
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,300
That you weren't one of
the filthy things that we hunt.

322
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,000
But we're not even
the same species.

323
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,000
- You're nothing to me.
- Don't say that to me.

324
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,200
Don't you say that to me.

325
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,300
Hello?

326
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,500
Someone here?

327
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,300
What did you do?

328
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,400
You shouldn't have come, Anna.

329
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,500
Why would you let
out Sam Winchester?

330
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,400
- Those were my orders.
- Orders?

331
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,800
Cass,
you saw him.

332
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,700
He's drinking
demon blood.

333
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,200
It's so much worse
than we thought.

334
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,000
Dean was trying to stop him.

335
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,900
You really shouldn't have come.

336
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,000
Unh-Unh, Sam.

337
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,000
The only place you're going
is back inside with me.

338
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,400
No.

339
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Damn it, boy.

340
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
You won't shoot me,
Bobby.

341
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
Don't test me.

342
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
You won't do it.

343
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,900
You can't do it.

344
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,600
We're trying to
help you, Sam.

345
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
Then shoot.

346
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,800
How in the hell
did he get out?

347
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,000
Maybe he had help.

348
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,200
Room full of busted devil's traps.

349
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,000
Demons?

350
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,200
- Ruby.
- That'd be my guess.

351
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
How did she even
touch the door?

352
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,100
- You think she's got the mojo?
- I didn't think so.

353
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
I don't know, man.

354
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,900
Well, what difference
does it make?

355
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,900
How he got gone ain't as important
as where he got gone to.

356
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,900
Yeah, well, I'll tell you one thing.
At this point, I hope he's with Ruby.

357
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,700
Why?

358
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,500
'Cause killing her's the next
big item on my to-Do list.

359
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,800
I thought you were on call
for angel duty.

360
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,200
I am on call -- In my car,
on my way to murder the bitch.

361
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,000
- One thing.
- what?

362
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,900
Sam don't
want to be found.

363
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,600
Which means he's gonna be
damn near impossible to find.

364
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,700
Yeah, we'll see.

365
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,600
Honeymoon suite.
Really, I'm flattered.

366
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,800
Did you bust me out
of that room?

367
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,600
How could I, Sam? the whole thing's
engineered to bite me in the ass.

368
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,500
Then how did I
get out of there?

369
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,000
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

370
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,200
You're out.
That's all that matters.

371
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,400
- I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah?

372
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,200
- Where the hell have you been?
- I got here as quick as I could.

373
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,400
I mean the past three weeks!
I've been calling you!

374
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,200
I've been pretty deep in it,
trying to dig out Lilith.

375
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Sometimes I can't sit around
and check my voicemail.

376
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
I'm sorry you're hurting.

377
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,740
Really.

378
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,480
I had no idea that Dean
would do that to you.

379
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,530
You and me both.

380
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,480
You didn't book this joint
just to impress me, did you?

381
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,170
Dean's gonna come after me.

382
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,600
And he knows my habits,

383
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,300
My aliases, everything.

384
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,280
He knows exactly which motel I'd pick.

385
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,010
Hence the room.

386
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,490
Whatever it takes to shake him.

387
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,500
Well, it won't be easy. I mean...

388
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,040
he knows you better than anyone.

389
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,920
Not as well as he thinks.

390
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,170
You know, it's sad.

391
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,200
What?

392
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,800
That things have gotten
this bad between you two.

393
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,140
Police found my car.

394
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,730
Abandoned in an alley in
Jamestown, North Dakota.

395
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,320
Well, he's switching up.

396
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,560
Any other cars stolen in Jamestown?

397
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,320
Two.

398
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,630
1999 Honda
civic --

399
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,240
Blue -- Nice
and anonymous,

400
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,230
Like Sam likes.

401
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,470
What was the other one?

402
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,100
White '05 escalade with custom rims.

403
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,860
It's a neon sign.

404
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,030
You're right. He'd never take that.

405
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,930
Which is exactly what he did.

406
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,750
You think?

407
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,710
I know that kid.

408
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,610
All right, I'll head in that direction.

409
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,360
You stay here, ride
the police databases.

410
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,870
We got to find him quick.

411
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,670
Your appetite's gotten much bigger.

412
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,880
What's that supposed to mean?

413
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,710
Sam, relax. It's okay. It's good.

414
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,930
It just means you're
getting stronger. That's all.

415
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,180
It means you're strong
enough to kill Lilith.

416
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,300
Just in time, too,

417
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,800
Because the final seals are breaking.

418
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,710
how many are left?

419
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,370
Three? Two? What?!

420
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,480
Well, where are the angles?

421
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,140
Screwing the pooch, wherever they are.

422
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,780
The point is, it's looking more and more

423
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,650
Like we're getting
down to the final seal.

424
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,520
And I found out something big.

425
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,930
What?

426
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,800
Seal 66?

427
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,110
It can't be broken by just any demon.

428
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,710
Apparently, only
Lucifers first can do it.

429
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,440
"Lucifer's first"?

430
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,610
Demon Sunday-School story.

431
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,700
God prefers humans to angels.

432
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,150
Lucifer gets jealous.
And then he gets creative.

433
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,880
And he twists and tempts a human soul

434
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,870
Into the very first demon
-- As a "screw you" to god.

435
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,350
It's what got him locked
up in the first place.

436
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,340
That was Lilith?

437
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,470
She's way older than she looks.

438
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,110
Wait, so...

439
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,890
if Lilith is the only one
who can break the final seal,

440
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,320
If I get to her in time...

441
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,190
then Lucifer never busts
out of his cage -- Exactly.

442
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,500
Great. You figure out where she is?

443
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,090
That bitch can hide.

444
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,660
But I finally have a lead

445
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,490
On someone who might be able to help us.

446
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,480
I closed in on a member
of Lilith's entourage.

447
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,380
You might call her a... personal chef.

448
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,750
Chef? Seriously?

449
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,490
What does she eat?

450
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,750
You don't want to know.

451
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,890
Did you hear about that
horrible thing at St. Paul's?

452
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,730
No.

453
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,440
One of the neonatal nurses

454
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,820
Walked right off the
unit with two babies.

455
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,790
You are kidding me. Swear to god.

456
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,420
Worked there 17 years,

457
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,110
Then one day, out of the
blue, she just does it.

458
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,180
That's just horrifying.

459
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:22,910
Now she's saying

460
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,870
That she doesn't even
remember what happened.

461
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,140
Like she was possessed.

462
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,770
nuts.

463
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:28,660
I know.

464
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,180
Who could ever lay a finger on them?

465
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,490
I know.

466
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,950
They're just delicious.

467
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,410
So, our demon gourmet nurse...

468
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,620
...you sure?

469
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,610
She'll be there.

470
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,860
Graveyard shift. Tomorrow night.

471
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,300
In the meantime,

472
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,410
If you're gonna be strong
enough to kill Lilith,

473
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
You're gonna need more
than I can give you now.

474
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,410
Sam.

475
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,910
Come on. It's okay.

476
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,810
I know, I need more.

477
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,170
I-I get it. I know it's okay.

478
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,760
I just...

479
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,310
I wish he'd trusted me, you know?

480
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,410
I'm sorry.

481
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,560
I just hope...

482
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,780
you know, when all this is over...

483
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,030
I hope we can fix things.

484
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,260
The cops found the escalade
in a ditch outside elk river.

485
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,550
How far away am I? Couple of hours.

486
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,190
I pulled up a weather
map, made some calls.

487
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,290
There's a town not far
from there, Coldspring,

488
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,840
Lighting up with demon signs.

489
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,820
That's a good place to look.

490
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,830
Hey, listen.

491
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,070
What? Us finding Sam?

492
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,600
That's got to be about getting him back,

493
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,720
Not pushing him away.

494
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,930
Right.

495
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,190
I know you're mad, Dean.

496
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,730
I understand. You got a right to be.

497
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,690
But... I'm
just saying --

498
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,910
Be good to him anyway.

499
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,120
You got to get through to him.

500
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,060
No! Let her go!

501
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,090
Just take it easy.

502
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,080
Wow, that must have been
some party you two had going,

503
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,440
Considering how hard you tried
to keep me from crashing it.

504
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,280
Well, solid try, but...

505
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,200
here I am.

506
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,930
Dean, I'm glad you're here.

507
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,710
Look...let's just talk about this.

508
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,680
Soon as she's dead, we
can talk all you want.

509
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,860
Ruby, get out of here.

510
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,260
She's not going anywhere.

511
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,330
she's poison, Sam!

512
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,250
Look what she did to you!

513
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,140
Well, she up and
vanishes, weeks at a time,

514
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,700
Leaves you cracking out for another hit!

515
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,160
She was looking for Lilith!

516
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,680
That is French for

517
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,550
"Manipulating your ass
10 ways from Sunday."

518
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,440
You're wrong, Dean.

519
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,460
Sam, you're lying to yourself.

520
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,170
I just... want you to be okay.

521
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,390
You would do the same for me.

522
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,210
You know you would.

523
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,150
Just listen.

524
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,270
Just listen for a second.

525
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,680
We got a lead on a
demon close to Lilith.

526
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,850
Come with us, Dean.
We'll do this together.

527
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,190
That sounds great.

528
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,200
As long as it's you and me.

529
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,970
Demon bitch is a deal breaker.

530
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,700
You kiss her goodbye,
we can go right now.

531
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,100
I can't.

532
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,350
Dean, I need her -- To
help me kill Lilith.

533
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,600
I know you can't wrap
your head around it.

534
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,630
But maybe, one day... you'll understand.

535
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,210
I'm the only one who can do this, Dean.

536
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,530
No, you're not the one
who's gonna do this.

537
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,430
Right. That's right. I forgot.
The angels think it's you.

538
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,580
You don't think I can? No.

539
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,030
You can't.

540
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,020
You're not strong enough.
And who the hell are you?

541
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,760
I'm being practical here. I'm
doing what needs to be done.

542
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,580
Yeah?

543
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,010
You're not gonna do a single damn thing.

544
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,600
Stop bossing me around, Dean!

545
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:02,950
Look.

546
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,920
My whole life, you take the wheel,

547
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,150
You call the shots.

548
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,280
And I trust you because
you are my brother.

549
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,810
Now, I am asking you,

550
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,630
For once...

551
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,870
trust me.

552
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,390
No.

553
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,490
You don't know what
you're doing, Sam. Yes, I do.

554
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,660
Then that's worse! Why?
Look, I'm telling you --

555
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,250
Because it's not something
that you're doing!

556
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,290
It's what you are!

557
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,120
It means...

558
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,630
what?

559
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,840
No.

560
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,390
Say it.

561
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,240
It means you're a monster.

562
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,100
You don't know me.

563
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,060
You never did.

564
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,430
And you never will.

565
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,190
You walk out that door...

566
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,550
don't you ever come back.

567
