1
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:06,323
- Hell hounds.
- Yeah, Dean. Your favorite.

2
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:15,323
I can't fight, I can't walk.
But I can do something.

3
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:17,323
I got everything we
need, to build a bomb.

4
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:23,323
- What are we doing?
- We're hunting ghosts.

5
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:25,323
You know who
does that, crazy people.

6
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:27,323
We, are insane.

7
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:32,323
Tomorrow we hunt the devil.

8
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:33,891
This is our last night on earth.

9
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:37,294
Take this thing to Lucifer
and empty it into his face.

10
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:43,367
You know I'd never hurt you.

11
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:45,403
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

12
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:47,905
I'm gonna kill you myself.

13
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,141
I'm going to rip your heart out!

14
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,342
That's good, Sam.

15
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:54,178
You keep fanning that fire in your belly...

16
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:55,813
All that pent-up rage.

17
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,847
I'm gonna need it.

18
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,233
The nurses tell me

19
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,735
That, uh, you're not taking your medication.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,772
You want to tell me why?

21
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:23,907
Susan?

22
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:25,709
The pills make me sleepy,

23
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:28,145
But I can't...

24
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,746
If I sleep, it'll come.

25
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:32,983
You mean the monster.

26
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:35,285
Now, we have talked about this.

27
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,753
But it killed Annie.

28
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,323
Susan, you're schizophrenic.

29
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:43,960
Your mind plays... tricks on you.

30
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:46,329
You get confused.

31
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:48,665
Sometimes you see things.

32
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:51,268
I know what I am.

33
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:54,337
Like I can see my dead son
standing right behind you...

34
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:56,106
I know he's not real.

35
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:01,111
But the monster... it is real.

36
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,683
Annie was your room-mate,

37
00:02:06,717 --> 00:02:09,186
And what happened
to her was painful...

38
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,520
for all of us.

39
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:15,292
Perhaps it's easier for
you to conjure up a monster

40
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:19,095
Than to face how tragic
her suicide really was.

41
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,998
I can hear it at night,

42
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:24,034
In the walls.

43
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:25,802
Please.

44
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:28,038
you have to believe me.

45
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:29,306
Susan...

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,176
There is no such thing as monsters.


47
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:22,559
Oh, my god!

48
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:23,860
Help me!

49
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,829
Help me!


50
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,865
They're starting early tonight.


51
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:33,236
Hurry!


52
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,375
Wait! Don't
pay attention to her!

53
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:39,910
It's coming!

54
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:42,245
Help me!

55
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,814
Help me!

56
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,850
Help me!

57
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,518
Aaah!


58
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:09,824
Supernatural
Season 5 Episode 11 "Sam, Interrupted"


59
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:27,591
You were referred to me by a Dr.
Babar in Chicago.

60
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,826
That's right.

61
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,662
Isn't there a children's
book about an elephant

62
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:34,064
named Babar?

63
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:35,098
I don't know.

64
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:37,434
I don't have any elephant books.

65
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:39,736
Look, doctor, I-I think that...

66
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,871
The doc was in over his head with this one

67
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,707
'cause my brother's, uh...

68
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,077
Okay, fine. Thank you.

69
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,479
That's... that's really not necessary.

70
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:53,717
Why don't you tell me how
you're feeling, Alex?


71
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,687
I'm fine.

72
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:01,091
I mean, okay, a little depressed, I guess.

73
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,460
All right. Any idea why?

74
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:06,129
Probably because I
started the apocalypse.

75
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:09,099
The apocalypse?

76
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,266
Yeah, that's right.

77
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:14,270
And you think you started it.

78
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,906
Well, yeah.

79
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,475
I-I mean

80
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,477
I killed this demon, Lilith...

81
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,545
and I accidentally freed Lucifer from hell.

82
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,382
So, now he's topside,
and we're trying to stop him.

83
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:29,452
W-who is?

84
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:30,754
Me. And him.

85
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,923
And, uh, this one angel.

86
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,926
Oh, you mean like a...
like an angel on your shoulder?

87
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,229
No, no. His name's Castiel.
He wears a trench coat.

88
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,930
See what I mean, doc?

89
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,733
I mean, the kid's been beating
himself up about this for months.

90
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:46,236
The apocalypse wasn't his fault.

91
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,039
It's not?

92
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:50,040
No.

93
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:51,641
There was this other demon... Ruby.

94
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,376
She got him addicted
to demon blood.

95
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,612
I mean, near the end, he was
practically chugging the stuff.

96
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:00,550
My brother's not evil.

97
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:02,986
He was just...

98
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,387
High.

99
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:07,857
Yeah?

100
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,693
So, could you fix him
up so we can get back

101
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,795
To traveling around the
country and hunting monsters?

102
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,668
Emma...

103
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:20,704
Cancel my lunch.

104
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,175
Dr. Fuller would like to see
you both under observation

105
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,876
for a couple of days.

106
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:28,211
Both, me too?

107
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:30,647
Yes, sugar. The doctor
thinks that would be best.

108
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:37,454
All right. I'm just gonna
give you a little check-up.

109
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,556
All right, look, nurse Latched,
let's get one thing straight...

110
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,725
I've seen "cuckoo's nest," so don't try

111
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,494
any of that soul crushing
authoritarian crap on me.

112
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:45,895
Hmm?

113
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,230
Okey-dokey.

114
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:52,769
All right, you can go ahead
and take down your pants.

115
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,070
Wait. Mm.

116
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,073
What? What... what for?


117
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:16,226
How was your silk wood shower?

118
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,627
Okay.

119
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,028
Yeah. Good. Yeah.

120
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,264
Good, um... good water pressure.

121
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:22,332
Did the nurse...

122
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:23,700
She was very thorough.

123
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:27,170
Yeah. Yeah good, good. Yeah.

124
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,678
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

125
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:37,413
Hey, it's the least we could do.

126
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,482
Martin saved dad's arse more
times than we can count.

127
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:40,717
He's a great hunter.

128
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,652
Was, until Albuquerque.

129
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,089
Besides, I-I just figure it's
best we keep busy. That's all.

130
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:47,190
Better than what?

131
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:50,193
Nothing.

132
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:55,565
Okay, look um...

133
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,567
Last few weeks, you kind
of been worrying me.

134
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,836
Oh, come on Sam. Stop.

135
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,204
Look, just because
we're in the looney bin.

136
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:02,639
doesn't give you the
right to head-shrink me.

137
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:04,073
Dean. Ellen and Jo dying...

138
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,875
yeah, it was a freakin' tragedy, okay?

139
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,477
But I'm not gonna wallow in it.

140
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:08,778
Dean, you always do this.

141
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:10,313
You can't just keep this crap in.

142
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,149
Watch me.

143
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,286
Oh, there he is.


144
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,664
Sam.
Dean.

145
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:28,965
Wow.

146
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,801
Wow, you boys got big.

147
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:32,936
You look good.

148
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,838
Thanks. You do too, Martin.



149
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,244
Well, thanks for coming.

150
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,179
Yeah.

151
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:44,714
In the old days,

152
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:46,316
I could've taken care of this thing

153
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,017
With both hands t-tied
behind my back

154
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:49,652
but...

155
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,721
Well, now...

156
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:53,389
What do you think it
is that we're hunting?

157
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:56,459
I don't know yet.

158
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:59,562
A ghost, demon, monster.

159
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:02,732
Animal, vegetable, mineral.

160
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:05,535
Hospital's had five deaths
in the last four months.

161
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:07,871
Doctors keep calling it suicides,

162
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:10,006
but they're wrong.

163
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,374
So you've seen this thing?

164
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:16,145
Has anyone seen this thing?

165
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,049
Well, a couple of patients have,
uh, had glimpses,

166
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:21,751
but that's not a lot to go on.

167
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:23,519
Are they reliable?

168
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,188
Oh, sure. Why wouldn't they be?

169
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:32,729
Gee, I don't know.

170
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:35,498
I know you boys think I'm
a bag of loose screws.

171
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,033
Well, you wouldn't be wrong,

172
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:39,035
but I wouldn't have called you

173
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:41,170
Unless there was something here.

174
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,839
I can feel it in my gut.

175
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,176
We believe you.

176
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,545
Have you checked any of the bodies,
found signs of an attack?

177
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:54,550
Well, uh, no.

178
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:56,185
I don't, uh...

179
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,087
I don't go around dead b-b...

180
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:00,223
b-bodies any more.

181
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:02,458
Dr. Fuller: Alex, Eddie.

182
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,527
Well, I'm glad to see
you're making friends.

183
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:07,897
Why don't you and
Mr. Creaser join us for group?

184
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:09,732
Please. Right this way.


185
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,474
Actually, I'm going to be putting you

186
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:19,742
in the afternoon group.

187
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:21,577
What? Why?

188
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,812
Well, to be frank, uh,

189
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:25,081
The relationship that you
have with your brother

190
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:27,417
seems dangerously codependent.

191
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,653
I think a little time apart
will do you both good.

192
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:38,761
All right, so, who would
like to start us off?

193
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,766
Anyone else?

194
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,601
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

195
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:50,073
All right, Ted. Calm down.

196
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,408
I am calm,

197
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,477
and I'd very calmly

198
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:56,879
like to talk about the
monster that's hunting us.

199
00:10:56,914 --> 00:10:58,948
Ted, we're not going to
have that discussion again.

200
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:00,850
It's not good for group.

201
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:03,753
I agree.

202
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,422
You know what else
isn't good for group?

203
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,191
A monster eating all our faces off!

204
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:09,926
All right, fine. Thank you.

205
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,361
- Now, anyone else.
- I saw it!

206
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:13,396
When it killed Susan!

207
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,798
I did, too. It had big lobster claws.
No, it didn't!

208
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,867
Yeah, and it was an alien,
like on "x-files."

209
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,002
Stop it!

210
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:21,137
Stop helping! Listen to me!

211
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:22,171
We're all dead!

212
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:24,807
That's enough!

213
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,914
There is no monster.

214
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,886
Now, Ted, do you need me
to call the orderlies...

215
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,521
Or can you behave?

216
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,623
Behave.

217
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,565
King me!

218
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,701
Eddie?

219
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,070
I'm Dr. Erica Cartwright.
I've been assigned your case.

220
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,406
You're my shrink?

221
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,508
Well, lucky me.

222
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,410
And you're my
paranoid schizophrenic

223
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:02,245
With narcissistic
personality disorder

224
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,946
and religious psychosis.

225
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:05,748
Lucky me.

226
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:08,051
Hmm.

227
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:09,152
Can we talk?

228
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:12,355
Yes.

229
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,157
I've actually got some
questions for you.

230
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,159
What a coincidence.
I've got some for you, too.

231
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,328
well then, quid pro quo, Clarice.

232
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:23,499
Okay, Hannibal. I'll go first.

233
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,201
How many hours a
night do you sleep

234
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,270
Three or four every
couple of nights.

235
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,372
What can you tell me about
the recent suicides in here?

236
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:30,573
They were tragic.

237
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:32,842
But you haven't
noticed anything strange,

238
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,278
You know, like, I don't know,
black smoke, sulfur?

239
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:36,946
No. Why? What's that
supposed to mean?

240
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,181
Demon signs.

241
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,716
I hunt demons,
monsters... that kind of thing.

242
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,351
How many drinks
do you have a week?

243
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,387
Well, I gotta sleep
sometime, so, uh... let's say

244
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,055
What's seven days times...

245
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,790
somewhere in the mid-50s.

246
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:49,959
You ever feel any,
uh, any cold spots

247
00:12:49,993 --> 00:12:52,528
or get a chill walking
through the hospital?

248
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,163
Not that I can
remember, If I had?

249
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:55,665
It means there's a ghost around.

250
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,201
Okay.

251
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,104
When was the last time you were
in a long-term relationship?

252
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:03,072
Define "long-term."

253
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:04,307
More than two months.

254
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:05,341
Never.

255
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,479
Have the patients reported
seeing anything weird?

256
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:12,014
In here? all the time.

257
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,249
Right.

258
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,051
So...

259
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,154
...Let's talk about your father.

260
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,367
Dean. Hey.

261
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:33,769
You okay?

262
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:35,671
I just got "thraped."

263
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,406
So, no, I am not okay.

264
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,408
- Tell me you found something.
- Yeah.

265
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,178
A guy says he saw the creature.
We should talk to him.

266
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,779
Want to meet back here in an hour?

267
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:45,381
Yeah, the sooner we
take care of this thing,

268
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:46,682
the sooner we can get going.

269
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:48,317
This place gives me the creeps.

270
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:02,198
Hi.

271
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:03,566
Hi.

272
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,634
I'm Wendy.

273
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:05,635
Uh-huh.

274
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:14,143
Maybe this place isn't so bad after all.

275
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:15,545
Dude...

276
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,013
<i>You cannot hit that.</i>

277
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,117
Oh, so torn.

278
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:28,991
About time. Nurses
are on their rounds

279
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:31,460
we got, like, 15, 20 minutes.
Where is this guy?

280
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,863
Room 306.


281
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:43,306
Oh! Geez!

282
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,507
Hurry up! Come on! Hurry up!

283
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,775
Back off, Dean!

284
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:19,455
Hey.

285
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,689
Yeah. I found something.

286
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:22,658
- What do you got?
- Right here.

287
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:24,426
Um... Give me a hand.

288
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:30,499
All right.

289
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:45,813
This hole goes all the
way through to his brain.

290
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,148
What does that mean?

291
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:50,785
Let's find out.

292
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:52,888
Seriously?

293
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:55,257
You might want to keep watch.

294
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:21,883
Dude!

295
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:23,952
Look... his brain's been sucked dry.

296
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:26,088
That's fascinating.
Somebody's coming.

297
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:44,406
What are you boys doing in here?

298
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,416
Pudding!

299
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:57,519
All right. Come on, you two.

300
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:02,124
Crazy works.

301
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,036
Are those original Gacys?

302
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:16,271
I painted those.

303
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:17,939
Back on point, please.

304
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:20,909
- Um so whatever this thing is...
- It's good.

305
00:17:20,943 --> 00:17:23,111
...I-it slurpees your brain...
sucks you dry.

306
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:26,615
Yeah, then it makes the
deaths look like suicides.

307
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,049
Any ideas?

308
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,554
Yeah.

309
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:35,090
A bad one.

310
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:36,825
What is it?

311
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,761
Well, I bet you a chicken dinner
it's what we're up against.

312
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:40,862
A wraith.

313
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:44,666
They crack open skulls
and feed on brain juice.

314
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,002
- You ever tangle with one before?
- Never.

315
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:49,004
Never wanted to, neither.

316
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,939
So how do we kill it?

317
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:52,174
Silver.

318
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,309
You so much as touch a
wraith with the stuff,

319
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:55,510
And the skin will crackle.

320
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:57,112
<i>Now, that's the good news.</i>

321
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:59,781
The bad news is...
They can pass as humans.

322
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:04,319
It could be any Peter, Paul,
or Mary in the joint.

323
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:06,788
Fantastic. So how
do we find it?

324
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:08,990
A-a mirror.

325
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:12,994
Lore says a wraith will show
its true form in a mirror.

326
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,696
Okay, well, we just
got to spot-check

327
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,398
every patient and
every staff member.

328
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:17,999
Okay. Yeah.

329
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:20,869
But, I mean, what's it
doing in a mental hospital?

330
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,070
A nut house...

331
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,005
It's... it's... I's a
perfect captive victim pool.

332
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,540
Sure.

333
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:27,209
Who... who's gonna
believe a patient

334
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:29,344
when they say
they saw a monster?

335
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,413
It's the perfect hunting ground.

336
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:45,060
What's up, doc?

337
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:47,562
You tell me.

338
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,130
Hunting.

339
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:50,966
A wraith, actually.

340
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,901
Could be anybody.

341
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:55,003
So... I could be a monster?

342
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:59,541
No. You're clean.

343
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:00,775
Why you?

344
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,410
Why me what?

345
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,179
Why do you have
to hunt monsters?

346
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:05,847
Why not let someone else do it?

347
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,353
I can't find anybody else that dumb.

348
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:16,358
It's my job.

349
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:18,660
Somebody's got to
save people's asses.

350
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:20,195
Yours included.

351
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:22,197
So, is there a quota?

352
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:24,432
How many people
do you have to save?

353
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,467
All of 'em.

354
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,102
All of them?

355
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:28,870
You think you have
to save everyone?

356
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:31,006
Yep. Whole wide
world of sports.

357
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,806
How?

358
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:37,646
Believe me, whatever you've got,
I've heard weirder.

359
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:42,917
It's the end of the world, okay?

360
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:45,720
I mean, it's the damn
biblical apocalypse.

361
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:48,490
And if I don't stop
it and save everyone,

362
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:50,825
Then no one will,
and then we all die.

363
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,528
That's horrible.

364
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:55,196
Yeah, tell me about it.

365
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:57,666
I mean, apocalypse
or no apocalypse,

366
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,234
Monsters or no monsters,

367
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:01,102
That's a crushing weight
to have on your shoulders.

368
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:05,607
To feel like six billion
lives depend on you.

369
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:08,777
God.

370
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:11,246
How do you get
up in the morning?

371
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,319
That's a good question.

372
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,120
Hello, Eddie.

373
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:22,123
Doc.

374
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,171
All right.

375
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:38,773
I had to raid three nurses'
stations to get these.

376
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:41,309
They're only silver-plated,
but they should work.

377
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,846
Oh, no, no, no.

378
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,715
Not today, sweetheart.
Come on. Keep walking.

379
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:48,049
I...

380
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,994
I want him now.

381
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:01,529
He's larger.

382
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:08,036
Hmm.

383
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:13,575
You've had worse.

384
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,143
Fuller is on call tonight,

385
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:17,479
So we'll have to hit
him after lights out.

386
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:18,880
All three of us.

387
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:20,482
What? No!

388
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:22,784
Martin, we got to
get past the security,

389
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:23,918
past the orderlies,

390
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:25,653
and then cut the
boss man's throat, okay?

391
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:27,088
It's gonna suck start to finish,

392
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:28,356
but we could use the backup.

393
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:29,958
No, I can't.

394
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,059
I can't.

395
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:33,061
We know what
happened in Albuquerque.

396
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:37,565
You don't know the half of it.

397
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,202
God... I used to be just like you two.

398
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,371
I used to think I was invincible.

399
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:45,039
And then...

400
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,641
Well, I found out I'm not.

401
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:48,543
Martin. You are still a hunter.

402
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:49,978
No, I'm not!

403
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:51,546
I'm useless!

404
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,915
Why do you think I checked myself
into the hotel California?

405
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:55,583
I'd give anything to help you boys.

406
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,285
I would.

407
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,021
But I-I can't.

408
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:02,590
I'm sorry. I can't.

409
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,471
He's still in the building.

410
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:18,807
You take the west wing. I'll take the east.

411
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:03,718
Aah!

412
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:26,774
No! No!

413
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,309
Look at his arm!

414
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:30,812
The cut's not burning!

415
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:31,813
It's not him!

416
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:33,381
It's not him.

417
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:56,518
You okay?

418
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:58,787
No.

419
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,056
No, I'm not okay.

420
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,792
I... I...I...

421
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:07,295
I am...

422
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,697
Awesome!

423
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:09,898
They give you something?

424
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:10,899
Oh, yeah.

425
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,101
They... they gave me everything.

426
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,402
It...

427
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:18,139
It's spectacu... lacular.

428
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:21,009
You always were a happy drunk.

429
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,717
Dean...

430
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:30,552
The doctor wasn't a wraith.

431
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:31,786
I know.

432
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,722
I don't understand it.

433
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:36,191
I mean, I saw it in the mirror.
It wasn't human.

434
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,660
Or you're seeing things.

435
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:41,029
Maybe... m-maybe,
maybe you're going crazy.

436
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,230
I'm not crazy.

437
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:43,965
Well, come on.

438
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,203
I mean, you've been at least...
Half crazy for a long time,

439
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,904
since you got back from hell...

440
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:51,439
or since before that, even.

441
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:53,808
And we're in a...
we're in a mental hospital.

442
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:57,212
Ma-maybe... maybe
you finally cracked.

443
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,480
You know, maybe...

444
00:24:58,514 --> 00:25:03,852
maybe now you
are really, for-real crazy.

445
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:06,388
I made a mistake. That's all.

446
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,655
I'll find the thing.

447
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,658
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

448
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,093
It's okay. Hey.

449
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:14,129
Hey, look at me.

450
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:16,431
It's okay...

451
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:19,634
'cause you're my brother...

452
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:21,436
And I still love ya.

453
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:23,938
Mm.

454
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:28,543
Boop.

455
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,583
You missed our session today.

456
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,618
I'm a little busy.

457
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:37,919
Still hunting that wraith?

458
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,287
People are dying.

459
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,056
People die all the time.

460
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,825
Look, lady, why don't you just let
me do my job, maybe save your life?

461
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,460
It's not my life that
I'm worried about.

462
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:47,796
Oh, my go... I am fine, okay?

463
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,863
I'm fine.

464
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:53,034
Come on. Even you
don't believe that.

465
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,136
All this pressure that you're
putting yourself under,

466
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:57,906
all this guilt... it's killing you.

467
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,008
You can't save everybody.

468
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,309
You can't.

469
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:04,679
Hell, these days, you
can't save anybody, Dean.

470
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:06,714
- What'd you say?
- The truth, Dean.

471
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:08,383
You got Ellen and Jo killed.

472
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,485
You shot Lucifer, but
you couldn't gank him.

473
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,053
You couldn't stop
Sam from killing Lilith,

474
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:14,322
and, oh, yeah, you
broke the first seal.

475
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,891
All you do is fail.

476
00:26:16,926 --> 00:26:19,094
Did you really think that you,
Dean Winchester,

477
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:21,129
With a G.E.D. and a
give-'em-hell attitude,

478
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,363
were gonna beat the devil?

479
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:23,698
Please.

480
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:25,433
The world is gonna burn,

481
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:27,702
and there is nothing
that you can do about it.

482
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,170
Who are you?

483
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:30,839
How do you know that stuff?!

484
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,707
Hey. Settle down.

485
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:34,876
Tell me!

486
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,946
I said settle down.

487
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,551
Who are you...

488
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:44,986
Who is she?

489
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:46,888
Who?

490
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:49,023
What are you, blind?! Her!

491
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,825
Pal, there's nobody there.

492
00:26:58,234 --> 00:27:00,368
I'm not real, Dean.

493
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:02,704
I'm in your head...

494
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:06,508
'cause you are going crazy.

495
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,250
Just leave me alone.

496
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,060
You asked to see me?

497
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,862
Yeah. Thanks.

498
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:04,265
I, um...

499
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,034
I just wanted to apologize.

500
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,736
l feel horrible about
what I did to you.

501
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,939
I thought you
were a monster.

502
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:13,641
I know that.

503
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:15,677
The question is, why?

504
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,449
I-I was...

505
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,851
It doesn't matter, um...

506
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:25,687
Because after what
happened last night,

507
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:27,488
I-I had a...

508
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:28,957
Moment of clarity.

509
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:30,225
Um...

510
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:35,096
I realized there's no
such thing as monsters.

511
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,770
Well, I'm... Glad to
hear you say that.

512
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,606
But honestly?

513
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,642
Monsters are the least
of your problems.

514
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:51,412
People can learn to
live with delusions,

515
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:53,147
but the anger I saw in you.

516
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:54,916
I...

517
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,620
You hurt those two men, and
you were going to kill me.

518
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,356
The look in your eyes
when you came after me...

519
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,625
I...

520
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,060
It was like you were
barely even human.

521
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,933
Like a man possessed.

522
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:17,939
I know.

523
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:25,079
Please...

524
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:28,016
Just...

525
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,985
Could you give me a second chance?

526
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:35,390
Well, this isn't a prison.

527
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:37,725
You'll be allowed to
go to the day room.

528
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,993
Under supervision.

529
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,662
Thank you.

530
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:45,700
But if there is one more outburst,

531
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:48,469
I will transfer you to a facility

532
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,805
that is equipped to
handle violent patients,

533
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:55,677
and believe me, they will
be far, far less forgiving.

534
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,086
Dean. Hey.

535
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,187
Whoa. What's wrong?

536
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,858
It's not the demon blood, Sam.

537
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,160
It never was.

538
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:13,561
What?

539
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,229
The problem was you.

540
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:17,598
It was always you...

541
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,768
The lies, your arrogance,

542
00:30:20,803 --> 00:30:23,204
that black spot on your soul.

543
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,373
Now we're all gonna
die because of you.

544
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,508
It's all your fault!
You killed all of us!

545
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:28,710
Pathetic freak!

546
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,011
You evil son of a bitch!

547
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,346
Loser!

548
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,381
- We're all gonna die! 
- Freak!

549
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,415
Loser!

550
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:37,118
Freak!


551
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,021
Aah!

552
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,592
Leave me alone!

553
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,194
Leave me alone!

554
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:48,129
Leave me alone! No!

555
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:50,531
Stop it! Leave me alone!

556
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:52,533
Leave me alone! I didn't do it!

557
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,436
Get off of me! Leave me alone!

558
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:57,772
Aah! No!

559
00:30:57,806 --> 00:30:59,640
Leave me alone!

560
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:02,510
What's happening?

561
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:04,445
What's happening?


562
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:18,659
Martin, martin, it's me! It's Dean!

563
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:20,161
Oh. Sorry.

564
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:25,099
You... you look like hell, boy.

565
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:26,601
I feel... I feel like it, too.

566
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,635
Where's Sam?

567
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:28,803
Lock down.

568
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:31,005
He went crazy, thank god.

569
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:31,906
What?

570
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,674
I'm going crazy, too.

571
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:36,310
I'm seeing things.
I'm hearing things.

572
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:38,613
W-we both are.

573
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,148
Crazy is the clue.

574
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:41,416
W-what do you mean?

575
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,121
- Dean?
- Crazy is the clue.

576
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,023
Y-you said that. What?

577
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:50,691
I mean, the things that
me and Sam have done,

578
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:52,660
The... the stuff we've seen...

579
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,896
We're gonna end up
going guano eventually,

580
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,498
Probably end up like a
couple of drooling nut bags.

581
00:31:58,634 --> 00:32:00,001
No offense.

582
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,936
None taken.

583
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,006
But me and him freaking
out on the same day?

584
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,341
I mean, it... it... it's got to be the...

585
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,277
- The monster.
- What?! Where? Where?

586
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:11,112
No, not... no, there's nothing there.

587
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,047
Look...

588
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:18,119
What if this thing
doesn't just feed on the insane?

589
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:21,255
What if it makes people insane?

590
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:24,926
Is that possible? Does,
does that seem real?

591
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,031
Well, I-I'm... I'm not
the most reliable source

592
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:31,399
On what is "real,"

593
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,668
But it sounds... makes sense.

594
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,102
Okay.

595
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:37,672
Okay, so... s-so we got infected.

596
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,474
You know, something
shot us up with crazy.

597
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:40,741
You know, something...

598
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:45,513
Maybe...

599
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,515
Maybe it was the ghost of my dad.

600
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,250
No.

601
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:51,052
Focus on the wraith, Dean.

602
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:53,354
- Focus!
- Right, the wraith. The wraith.

603
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,256
Okay, so the wraith... the wraith.

604
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,557
It... it poisoned us.

605
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:57,992
It...

606
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:01,262
Maybe with venom, you
know, by t... by touch.

607
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:05,066
Or... or... or venom
or, um, saliva.

608
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:07,535
Wendy.

609
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,736
Wendy?

610
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,839
Wendy! Wendy slobbered
all over me and Sam!

611
00:33:11,874 --> 00:33:13,774
That's how we got infected!

612
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,774
Dean!

613
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:36,097
I can't step on the cracks.

614
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:50,378
Is this real?

615
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,290
Oh, it is, sugar.

616
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:04,592
It's very real.

617
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:25,554
Aaah!

618
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:43,757
She's still alive!

619
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:47,795
There's two patients,
in Wendy's room.

620
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:49,630
They attacked me.

621
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,538
Dean? Can you hear me?

622
00:34:57,572 --> 00:34:59,440
Dean!

623
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:02,176
You've got to get out
there and kill that thing.

624
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,678
I'll take care of her.

625
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:08,415
I-I can't.

626
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,951
You have to. You
have no choice, son.

627
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:15,522
Go!

628
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:16,790
Dean, run!

629
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:17,758
Run!

630
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:42,483
Hey! Let me go!

631
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:45,119
No.

632
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:48,088
You are far too angry to be
out there in the real world.

633
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:53,494
- You!
- Of course it's me.

634
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:58,399
I gotta say, you hunters don't
exactly live up to your rep.

635
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:01,502
I mean, Martin's a
wreck. He's harmless.

636
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:03,671
And you and your
brother come in here,

637
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,706
talking tough about killing monsters?

638
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,742
Kind of made you easy to spot.

639
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:11,345
Then all it took was a touch...

640
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,083
and you were mine.

641
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:19,219
Oh, I love it in here.

642
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:22,923
This place is my own
personal five-star restaurant.

643
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:24,525
Mmm.

644
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:27,728
Mmm.

645
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:33,367
Crazy brains... they get soaked
in dopamine and adrenaline

646
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,903
and just all sorts of
hormones and chemicals

647
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:38,338
that make them, delicious.

648
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:43,243
And the crazier they are,
the better they taste.

649
00:36:43,278 --> 00:36:44,645
You did this to me!

650
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:48,549
Well... I helped.

651
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,717
But that rage?

652
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,452
No, no, no, no. That's all you.

653
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:55,556
I don't make crazy, I just
crank up what's already there.

654
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,224
You build your own hell.

655
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,859
But I give you the legos.

656
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:01,061
And when you're ripe...

657
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:06,734
I make all of your 
problems disappear.

658
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:11,438
You get away from him!

659
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:14,975
Do you really think this is
gonna end well for you, kiddo?

660
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,144
No.

661
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:22,449
But I'm crazy, so what the hell.

662
00:38:02,524 --> 00:38:03,724
Aaaah!

663
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:26,513
Are you still crazy?

664
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,918
Not any more than usual.

665
00:38:32,554 --> 00:38:34,321
- We got to get out of here.
- Yeah.

666
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:51,656
Well, looks like Tom Cruise
was right, shrinks suck.

667
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:55,026
What are you doing?

668
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,460
Sam, are you okay?

669
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,263
No.

670
00:38:58,298 --> 00:38:59,965
- No, the wraith... 
- What about her?

671
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:01,533
She was right.

672
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:03,569
No, she wasn't. She's dead, okay?

673
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:06,204
Let's hit the road. I need a drink Or 12.

674
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,941
Most of the time I can hide it,

675
00:39:08,975 --> 00:39:11,043
But... I am angry.

676
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:12,911
I'm mad at everything.

677
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:14,813
I used to be mad at you and dad,

678
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:16,615
then Lilith, now it's Lucifer.

679
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:19,451
A-and I make excuses. I blame,
Ruby or the demon blood.

680
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:22,521
But it's not their fault,
it's not them. It's me.

681
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:24,590
It's inside me.

682
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:28,894
I am mad all the time...

683
00:39:28,928 --> 00:39:30,629
and I don't know why.

684
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:32,931
Stop.

685
00:39:32,965 --> 00:39:34,399
Stop it.

686
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,603
So what if you are?

687
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,606
What are you gonna do,
take a leave of absence?

688
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,441
You gonna say yes to Lucifer?

689
00:39:43,476 --> 00:39:44,609
What?

690
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:45,743
No, of course not. I...

691
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:46,744
Exactly.

692
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,747
And that's exactly
what you're gonna do.

693
00:39:49,782 --> 00:39:51,116
You're gonna take all that crap,

694
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,484
and you're gonna bury it.

695
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:53,751
You're gonna forget about it...

696
00:39:53,786 --> 00:39:55,487
because that's how we keep going.

697
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:58,957
That's how we don't
end up like Martin!

698
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,827
Are you with me?

699
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:06,531
Come on, man,
are you with me?

700
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:10,935
I'm with you.

701
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:13,638
Good.

702
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:19,344
Let's get the hell out of here.
