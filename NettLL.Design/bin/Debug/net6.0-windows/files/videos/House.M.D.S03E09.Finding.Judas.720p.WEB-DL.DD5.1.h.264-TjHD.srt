(AMUSEMENT PARK MUSIC PLAYING)

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
All right. Stand here.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,680
You're just tall enough.

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,340
I...

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,540
I don't...

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,550
I don't think I am.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,950
It just goes around.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,350
There's nothing to be
scared of, all right?

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,220
I didn't say I was scared.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,310
It'll be fun.

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,090
Come on, when I was a kid,
this was
my favorite thing ever.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,890
I don't like rides.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,990
All right. All right.

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,460
(STUTTERING)
I just...
I thought it would be fun.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,260
I shouldn't be
making you do this.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,320
Uh...

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,430
Let's go home.
We can have fun at home.

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,330
No, Daddy. Wait.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,810
The ride does look like fun.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,620
Oh, this is awesome.

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,130
(SCREAMING LOUDLY)

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,910
MR. HARTMANN:
Alice? Are you all right?

23
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,680
Honey, you all right?

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,750
Alice? Alice? Are you okay?

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,950
MR. HARTMANN:
Nothing happened.

26
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,220
EDIE: Something happened.

27
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,320
It was a little kiddie ride.

28
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,380
She hates those rides.

29
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,950
I don't understand
why you insist on
making her...

30
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,660
Okay, I appreciate
the fullness of your answers,

31
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,460
but I just wanted
to know if she'd had

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,370
any history of
abdominal problems.

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,600
No.
No.

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,940
The admitting doctor noted
no family history of...

35
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,740
I have an aunt
with Crohn's disease.

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,640
You didn't mention that?

37
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,910
I forgot what it
was called, okay?

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,140
Your aunt's got
a million things
wrong with her.

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,710
If you paid attention
for five minutes...

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,610
I doubt it's Crohn's.
She has none of
the other symptoms.

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,590
You're alone with
her for eight hours,
she ends up in the hospital.

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,380
I'm wondering if
we can focus on

43
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,250
answering the questions,
Mrs. Hartmann.

44
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,950
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann.
We're divorced.

45
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,930
I suspected.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,830
And your past generosity
made me think of you.

47
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,200
We're half a million dollars
from our goal.

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,000
Of course,
this is a naming opportunity
for your foundation.

49
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,770
Is there a problem?

50
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,080
There's something
on your face.

51
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,850
It's, uh...

52
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,290
(CLEARING HER THROAT)

53
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,650
Excuse me.
Oh...

54
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,720
CUDDY: Oh, God.

55
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm sitting in there
hoping it's a sniper,

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,100
because at least then
the sociopath isn't
my employee.

57
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,300
This baby won me second place
in the clinic's weekly

58
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,640
"weirdest thing pulled out
of an orifice" contest.

59
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,810
I am this close
to putting a new lab
in Oncology.

60
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,020
You do not want
to know what came in first.

61
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,240
House.

62
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,580
It rhymes with fucchini.

63
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,680
Give me his pills.

64
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,090
Where's my prescription?

65
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,490
No more
free-floating prescriptions.

66
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,790
Princeton P.D.
Has already forced
Wilson to shut down.

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,270
A cop says,
"Boo," Wilson shuts down.

68
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,670
Every doctor in
this place is afraid

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,170
to make a move
without covering his ass.

70
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,760
You think maybe
you're shouting
at the wrong person?

71
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,810
Tritter's obviously
out to get me.
He doesn't...

72
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,140
You forged prescriptions!

73
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,200
Allegedly.

74
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,350
Your pain has become my pain.

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,740
From now on,
you get reasonable doses
at reasonable times.

76
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,790
But I hurt in
an unreasonable way.

77
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,050
Then dip into
your secret stash.

78
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,420
Tritter took it.

79
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,120
Then move on to your secret,
secret stash.

80
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,590
I ran out.

81
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,990
Then move on to your secret,
secret, secret stash.

82
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,000
Parents say she's
not on any meds.

83
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,980
If the pancreatitis
wasn't set off by drugs,
and she hasn't been sick,

84
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,780
that leaves trauma
or some kind of
structural defect.

85
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,340
Put up the CT.

86
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,750
What's that density there?

87
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,910
Shadow.
Looks normal to me.

88
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,020
We got
a referral from...

89
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,420
HOUSE: Excuse me.

90
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,900
You stash your drugs
in a lupus textbook?

91
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,430
It's never lupus.

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,970
Who's got gallstones,
and why do we care?

93
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,430
Gallstones?

94
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,700
Biliary duct is dilated,
probably from
a stone lodged in it.

95
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,570
Must've caused a nasty
case of pancreatitis.

96
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,010
She's six. Six-year-olds
don't get gallstones.

97
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,940
So, she didn't
have pancreatitis?

98
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,950
Your theory is
an invisible gallstone?

99
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,680
His theory correctly
predicted pancreatitis.

100
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,050
You might want to wait until
he actually
tells us his theory

101
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,060
before you start
kissing his theory's ass.

102
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,990
My theory is...

103
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,890
Vanishing gallstone.

104
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,090
She had it and it passed.

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,530
Those things travel
in packs.

106
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,120
The rest of them are
probably hiding out

107
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,760
in her gallbladder.
Do an ultrasound.

108
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,200
If I'm right,
take out the organ,
so we can analyze the stones.

109
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,410
CHASE: I wasn't
kissing his ass.

110
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,350
FOREMAN: It must have
just looked that way
from our angle,

111
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,510
you on your knees,
House bending over.

112
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,420
He predicted
the pancreatitis.

113
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,540
It's his dad's fault.

114
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,780
My dad was an ass.

115
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,450
But you did
everything he wanted you to,

116
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,390
and in return,
you got
everything you wanted.

117
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,020
Yeah, it's that simple.

118
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,360
The strategy worked.

119
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,590
Dad got him a cushy job,
paid for his cushy life.

120
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,890
Cut me out
of his cushy will.

121
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,170
Told you.
It's just his nature.

122
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,440
Poor guy's
hard-wired to kiss ass.

123
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,000
House was right.
Gallstones.

124
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,580
I didn't know a kid
could get gallstones.

125
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,270
It's unusual.

126
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,080
That's why we need to
see what's causing it.

127
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,210
We'd like to remove
Alice's gallbladder
and analyze the stones.

128
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,380
Sure.
No.

129
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,510
Just 'cause I said sure?

130
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,750
I am capable of
my own thoughts.

131
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,880
It's a simple procedure.

132
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,080
The gallbladder
isn't essential to...

133
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,150
The doctor thinks
we should do it.

134
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,220
We should do it, Edie.

135
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,630
You think maybe we should
get a second opinion

136
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,630
before we start removing
our child's organs?

137
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,840
It's an effective use
of taxpayer's money.

138
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,850
I'm actually off this week.

139
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,510
I'm guessing
you don't have a family.

140
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,340
Most people have
enough going on
in their lives

141
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,790
that they don't have
to personalize every slight.

142
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,650
This isn't personal.

143
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,290
Not anymore.

144
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,450
My head of Oncology
had to shut down.

145
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,400
My entire staff are
afraid to make a move
without covering their ass.

146
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,330
I think you're angry
at the wrong person.

147
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,300
You think Dr. Wilson deserved
to have his assets seized,

148
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,340
his entire practice ruined?

149
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,570
No.

150
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,610
So, you just don't care?

151
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,440
This is how I get
what I want.

152
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,710
I put pressure on people,
and if it doesn't work
on Wilson,

153
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,990
it'll work on you.

154
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,790
You punish the innocent.

155
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,980
None of you are innocent.

156
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,590
Not one of you.

157
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,260
Not one of you has
told me the truth
about Dr. House.

158
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,960
The pills allow him
to cope with the pain.

159
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,940
No. The pills distort reality.
He is an addict.

160
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,000
He's not out robbing
a liquor store, or...

161
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,340
No, he's treating people.

162
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,750
He needs to find
a different way to cope
before he kills somebody.

163
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,540
If he hasn't
done that already.

164
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,320
If you're right,
he has a medical problem.

165
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,080
It should be dealt with
by doctors.

166
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,180
Not by...

167
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,250
It's not being
dealt with by doctors.

168
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,960
Doctors are covering it up.

169
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,890
The whole point
of the criminal
justice system

170
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,230
is to make things right
when everything else fails.

171
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,600
With all due respect,

172
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,870
you have failed.

173
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,810
Sorry, didn't know
you wanted your kid dead.

174
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,190
Although, for a couple of G's,
I can still make it happen.

175
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,250
Who the hell are you?

176
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,730
I am a complete stranger,

177
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,320
who apparently cares more
about whether your kid dies
than you do.

178
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,490
You're Dr. House.

179
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,200
You've seen my stage show.

180
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,830
She's not dying.
She has pancreatitis.

181
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,740
Once you've treated that,
I'm taking her home.

182
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,100
And do what, burn sage?

183
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,540
I want you
to do the surgery.

184
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,840
My father had gallstones.

185
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,240
They were totally harmless.

186
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,780
Alice had one bad one,
but it passed.

187
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,380
For all we know,
this is over.

188
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,280
And for all we know,
she could get
sick again tomorrow.

189
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,840
Then I'll take her
to her pediatrician.

190
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,510
She's six, Rob.

191
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,320
She shouldn't have
unnecessary surgery.

192
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,190
Or a moron for a mom,
but what can you do?

193
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,730
You're the doctor.
I'm the mother.

194
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,630
I outrank you.
Live with it.

195
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,670
I've read the file.
You've got 15 minutes.

196
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,440
It's people like this
who killed Copernicus.

197
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,570
Galileo.

198
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,840
Either way.

199
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,170
And they just
locked Galileo up.

200
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,340
They killed his spirit,
and nobody likes a show-off.

201
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,980
Luckily, Alice Hartmann
has a dad who's willing
to see reason.

202
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,150
Reason, as defined by
slavishly deferring to you.

203
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,380
Their doctor.

204
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,720
Your Honor,
I've had no opportunity

205
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,880
to consult my attorney.

206
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,150
There's no time.

207
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,790
All I want is
a second opinion before...

208
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,490
No time.

209
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,030
Your testimony is
their child will die

210
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,500
if I don't grant
this motion right now?

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,830
Am I under oath?

212
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,390
Let's say yes.

213
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,570
My testimony is
that this child

214
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,670
might die if you
don't grant this motion
right now.

215
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,710
Literally no time
for a second opinion?

216
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,440
Wouldn't be as good
as the first opinion.

217
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,640
Dr. Cuddy,
what do you think?

218
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,410
She's not
a specialist in this area.

219
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,280
Her opinion is worthless.

220
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,190
Dr. Cuddy, what do
you think of Dr. House?

221
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,890
Is he as big a jerk
as I think he is?

222
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,150
Bigger.

223
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,090
But he knows what
he's talking about.

224
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,510
Got a page.

225
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,960
She's complaining
about her stitches.

226
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,860
The nurse just said
that's completely normal.

227
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,690
Did you get the test results
for the gallstones?

228
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,790
Any minute now.

229
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,760
No time for a second opinion,
but the test takes three...

230
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,320
My skin hurts.

231
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,270
I know I no longer
have the right

232
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
to demand it but could
you please take a look?

233
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,900
Sure.

234
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,960
She's pissed,
so now she's just looking
for things to go wrong.

235
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,450
You're right, I'm so petty
I hope she dies so it
vindicates my opinion.

236
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,240
I didn't mean that, sweetie.

237
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,910
Mommy was being sarcastic.

238
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,680
She's a few years away
from grasping sarcasm,
don't you think?

239
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,850
Guys.

240
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,030
I already gave
you that number.

241
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,440
Simple surgical procedure
turns a little girl
into <i>The English Patient.</i>

242
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,530
What gives?

243
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,910
Must be allergic
to something we used
in the surgery.

244
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,380
Cameron,

245
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,710
C-A-M-E-R-O-N.

246
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,480
This is my office.
I'm talking.

247
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,310
There are people
here who work for me.

248
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,250
They're not listening.
Explain this to me.

249
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,950
Tritter froze my account.

250
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,510
They're checking theirs.

251
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,150
I'm on hold with a lawyer.

252
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,280
Call Wilson's lawyer.

253
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,490
He'll tell you exactly how
and why you're screwed.

254
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,960
This kid has no
history of allergies so...

255
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,530
You gotta talk to Tritter.

256
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,620
You gotta make this go away.

257
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,000
CHASE: Yeah, great plan.

258
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,560
The man is obviously
open to reason.

259
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,730
Well, here's the plan,
we do nothing.

260
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,710
HOUSE: We while away the time
diagnosing the patient.

261
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,040
The stones were
calcium bilirubinate.

262
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,470
Pigment stones.

263
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,010
Which are non-conclusive.

264
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,340
Kid presented
with low-grade fever,
mild anemia.

265
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,820
That, plus the stones,
indicates bacterial infection.

266
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,010
Bacterial infections
don't cause a vesicular rash,

267
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,390
and doing nothing
is not a plan.

268
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,080
It's specifically
a lack of a plan.

269
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,390
We cut into her belly,
the bad boys escape.

270
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,490
They swarm over,
colonize the wounds,
and kaplow, vesicular rash.

271
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,800
Allergic reaction is
100 times more likely,
with or without a history.

272
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,360
Fever and anemia
could have been
symptoms of pancreatitis.

273
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,600
Hello?

274
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,780
CAMERON: Thank you
for your help.

275
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,370
They froze my accounts.

276
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,740
"Thank you for your help"?

277
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,370
It's not her fault.

278
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,970
He hasn't gotten
to mine, yet.

279
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,180
I'm gonna withdraw
as much as I can,
as fast as I can.

280
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,780
Lunch is on me.

281
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,280
Do a scratch test.
Check for allergies.

282
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,190
When it comes back negative,
start broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

283
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,560
Bullies bully.

284
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,530
They don't get a reaction,
they lose interest.

285
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,060
Now go do what I ask
before I stick
your heads in toilets.

286
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,110
How'd Otter get here?

287
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,170
Daddy got him last night.

288
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,610
It was at the dry cleaner.
They close at 6:00.

289
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,110
How'd you get it?

290
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,380
I drove over there,

291
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,720
and I knocked for
about 10 minutes,
and then I begged.

292
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,920
How about some ice cream
for when this is through?

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,560
My tummy hurts.

294
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,270
Ginger ale?

295
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,160
Yeah?

296
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,960
I'll take over.

297
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,530
Be right back.

298
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,740
He's always been really good
at the big romantic gestures,

299
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,150
but ask him to do the dishes,
or show up for a meal
on time, or drive her...

300
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,880
Almost done here.

301
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,830
What are you doing here?

302
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,900
I work here.

303
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,450
You passively-aggressively
gave up your practice.

304
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,600
I have clinic hours.

305
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,650
And now you're
passively-aggressively
spreading peanut butter

306
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,280
with a big sign
around your neck saying,

307
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,620
"Wilson doesn't
have enough cash
for the cafeteria."

308
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,380
You know,
before Lenny Bruce died
of a drug overdose...

309
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,820
(EXCLAIMING)

310
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,620
If you're going
to confront me

311
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,520
with everyone who
ever abused narcotics,

312
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,060
I think I'm gonna have to get
something to read.

313
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,890
...he was arrested
on obscenity charges.

314
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,960
He went through
a series of arrests
and trials,

315
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,130
because he just couldn't
stop challenging the police.

316
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,670
He became obsessed
with his own legal problems,

317
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,570
and his act turned into long,
humorless rants

318
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,510
about fascist cops and
the violation of his rights.

319
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,880
I get it, I get it.

320
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,310
I need to change
my nightclub act.

321
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,810
You think more props?

322
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,480
House, scratch test
is getting results,
a lot of results.

323
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,160
MR. HARTMANN: How can she be
allergic to everything?

324
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,710
She can't be.

325
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,760
It has to be an infection.

326
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,900
You see
a positive allergy test
and decide it's infection?

327
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,310
The bacteria got
into the scratches
in her back.

328
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,850
The infection's radial.

329
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,820
The shape of this isn't.
Eat this.

330
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,980
I don't feel like eating.

331
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,110
It'll make you better.

332
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,210
A sandwich?

333
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,280
Magic sandwich.

334
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,220
There's no such thing as...

335
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,230
Just take a damn bite,
okay, kid?

336
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,180
Amazing how she
didn't go into
anaphylactic shock.

337
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,910
That's
diagnostically ridiculous.

338
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,350
Right, she's allergic
to everything except peanuts.

339
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,220
If she is allergic,
antibiotics could cause
a massive systemic reaction.

340
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,720
If she's allergic,
but she's not.

341
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,390
FOREMAN: Chase, you're right.

342
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,760
The shape indicates allergy.

343
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,230
The tests indicate allergy.

344
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,990
Just because she's
not allergic to peanuts,

345
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,000
doesn't mean
she's not allergic
to lidocaine or...

346
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,830
Chase, hang the bag.

347
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,290
You can grow
a backbone tomorrow.

348
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,800
No, I'm not giving
my daughter drugs

349
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,410
that could shut
her system down.

350
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,910
You know what else
shuts down systems?

351
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,170
Death.

352
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,100
Sorry. I can't let you
do this.

353
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,490
Luckily,
Alice Hartmann has a mom,
who is willing to see reason.

354
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,260
You were in here yesterday,
telling me

355
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,730
her father's guardianship
was best for her.

356
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,820
I honestly figured I'd get
a different judge today.

357
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,700
You agree with Dr. House now?

358
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,890
Now my kid actually is sick.

359
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,100
She was sick yesterday.

360
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,540
Her pediatrician
doesn't know what's wrong

361
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,040
with her,
says Dr. House is the best.

362
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,170
She loses guardianship,
and all of a sudden
House is a hero.

363
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,400
It's got nothing to
do with me deciding...

364
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,700
JUDGE: Hey, zip it!

365
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,010
I've heard enough.

366
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,140
This lawyering thing is easy.

367
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,270
You shut up, too.

368
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,750
Arguing over every decision
is a waste of her time
and mine.

369
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,850
Since her parents can't,
or won't, agree,

370
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,180
I'm awarding
temporary guardianship
to a doctor,

371
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,860
who'll place
the health of the child
above all else...

372
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,990
I don't think Dr. House
is capable of...

373
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,190
...Dr. Cuddy.

374
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,830
Yes, Your Honor.

375
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,530
No, I was finishing
my sentence.

376
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,440
The kid's all yours.

377
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,140
<i>HOUSE.: 3.:00, give me</i>
<i>the pills.</i>

378
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,370
I don't even know this kid.

379
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,350
How am I supposed to decide
what's best for her?

380
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,540
Fine, I'll choose.

381
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,520
I'm going to side with
the angry doctor's opinion.

382
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,640
Give me my pills.

383
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,150
We're not gonna
go broad-spectrum.

384
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,450
If there's any chance
that she's allergic...

385
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,510
There is no chance.

386
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,450
Of course there's a chance.
I'm appealing.

387
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,650
No, you're not.

388
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,450
If you think it's bacterial,
pick one antibiotic.

389
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,520
It's not going to be enough.

390
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,560
We need to go broad-spectrum.

391
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,670
It kills bugs.
That's what you want.

392
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,860
We'll go with metronidazole.

393
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,470
<i>TRITTER.: You don't have to</i>
<i>testify he's broken any laws,</i>

394
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,440
though I'm sure you could.

395
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,440
Just how many pills
he takes in a day.

396
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,350
'Cause I'm fairly confident
I can prove that he didn't

397
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,910
have that many
legitimate prescriptions.

398
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,390
I really hope no one dies
while I'm sitting
here not talking to you.

399
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,820
I, uh, I had a, uh...

400
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,060
Had a buddy at Trenton P.D.

401
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,760
Do some digging.

402
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,320
Your brother,
locked up for drugs.

403
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,240
Your own flesh and blood,
and you don't even visit.

404
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,800
But your boss
practices medicine on drugs,

405
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,780
time to start
lying to the cops.

406
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,080
If I run out for coffee,
will I get back
before you make your point?

407
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,780
You testify,

408
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,710
I can make sure
that Marcus
goes free on parole

409
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,300
in less than two months.

410
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,490
My brother and I, uh...

411
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,660
We grew up in the same home.

412
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,630
But...

413
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,000
I made something of myself.

414
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,210
He didn't.

415
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,940
Dr. Foreman,
the way you talk,

416
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,320
you'd think
you never committed
any crimes yourself.

417
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,050
Now, you and Dr. House,
you are both cold bastards.

418
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,660
You don't give a damn
about your brother,
and you can't stand House.

419
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,890
But I do expect you
to take this deal,

420
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,670
because you hate
hypocrisy more.

421
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,970
House has had 1,000 chances.

422
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,840
You've got two chances.

423
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,740
Why is your brother
stuck at one?

424
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,020
CUDDY: Well, if she were
allergic to this antibiotic,
we would have seen it by now.

425
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,390
I think we are
out of the woods
as far as that goes.

426
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,420
Guess they occasionally
get one right.

427
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,660
You're going to
be glib about this?

428
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,760
You almost killed her.

429
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,860
I made a choice.

430
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,230
The same choice
you made yesterday,

431
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,630
only when I make
it I'm an imbecile.

432
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,600
Every decision you have made
has been wrong.

433
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,610
When this is over,
I'm suing for sole custody.

434
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,800
Because I trusted
doctors when you didn't?

435
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,440
Because it's not just about
the past two days.

436
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,240
MR. HARTMANN: Like you have
the hotline on what's best
for Alice. She loves me.

437
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,010
EDIE: She never does
her homework
when she's with you.

438
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,180
She never brushes her hair.

439
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,120
Her heart's racing,
pressure's rising.

440
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,120
The two of you get out.

441
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm her mother.
You can't just...

442
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,790
You fight,
she has an anxiety attack.

443
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,190
The two of you are
making her worse.

444
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,420
Get out, and don't come back.

445
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,540
How's the kid doing?

446
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,200
Much better as of
about two hours ago.

447
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,930
You got any money for lunch?

448
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,880
If you like
parsley and croutons.

449
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,880
Tritter finally
froze my accounts.

450
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,940
Really?

451
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,110
You surprised?
Why wouldn't he?

452
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,780
I figured if he
was singling you out,

453
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,510
you must have done
something different.

454
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,250
What? Like talking?
Yeah.

455
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,020
And now that he's
frozen your accounts,
you probably will.

456
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,420
You need the cash, right?

457
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,550
He doesn't freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

458
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,750
He does freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

459
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,730
Is Alice having
some procedure done?

460
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,060
She's fine. She's resting.

461
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,260
Where?
In her room.

462
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,100
Where you're not supposed...
I was just at the window.

463
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,470
There's no one in there.

464
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,900
Her backpack
wasn't there, either.

465
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,770
You don't think her
father could have...

466
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,370
Call Security.

467
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,010
Get a gurney.

468
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,780
MR. HARTMANN:
She's stiff. She can't move.

469
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,220
I don't know what happened.

470
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,760
She seemed fine.

471
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,360
Help her. Please.

472
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,160
On the plus side,
she could medal in luge.

473
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,110
Muscle rigidity
is almost
exclusively neurological.

474
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,340
Neuroaxonal dystrophy?
She's the right age.

475
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,110
CHASE: Except that her liver's
starting to shut down.

476
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,240
No dystrophy would...

477
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,610
Metronidazole, great idea.

478
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,080
"Let's not go broad-spectrum.

479
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,120
"Let's not take any chances
on actually curing her."

480
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,710
House, can you focus
on the case?

481
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,880
No, because I'm in pain,

482
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,220
'cause you think
that compromise
is the answer to everything.

483
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,420
I need more pills.

484
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,020
Muscle rigidity
plus liver involvement
means Wilson's.

485
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,570
No. No corneal rings,
no mental changes.

486
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,000
CAMERON: Then what?

487
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,400
I need more pills!

488
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,470
No! You are
on a reasonable...

489
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,170
What the hell does
"reasonable" mean?

490
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,650
Keep it quiet.

491
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,280
Her BP reacts to stress
and yelling is not...

492
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,920
If you think that
I'm not in pain,
then don't give me anything.

493
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,460
Keep me away
from the aspirin,

494
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,020
but if I'm in
a butt-load of pain,
I need a butt-load of pills.

495
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,620
Fine. You need more pills.

496
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,320
You're not getting them.

497
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,030
You can have all
the aspirin you want.

498
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,100
FOREMAN: I say we draw straws.

499
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,870
Loser drives down to Trenton
and scores him an eight ball.

500
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,980
Which one of you two
gave her an aspirin?

501
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,880
What?
Her symptoms fit
Reye's Syndrome.

502
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,550
Which doesn't make any sense,
unless she took aspirin.

503
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,920
Rob?
No way. She's a kid.

504
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,460
I've read
the 800 warning labels.

505
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,520
I'm not even angry.

506
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,580
I just want her to be okay.

507
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,890
HOUSE: She's lying.

508
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,260
She's angry,
'cause you kidnapped her kid.

509
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,060
She'll be angrier
if the kid dies.

510
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,690
I didn't.
One aspirin

511
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,200
combined with
a pre-existing infection,

512
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,770
that's all it takes
to set off an attack.

513
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,930
I'm not lying.

514
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,630
Well, sure, you've
certainly earned our trust.

515
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,680
Where was Alice
the night before she came in?

516
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,710
With me. Well, at my house.

517
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,810
I went out.
She stayed
with the babysitter.

518
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,350
Where were you?
None of your business.

519
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,250
You hired someone
that might have
poisoned our daughter.

520
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,580
She's 15.
She's very responsible.

521
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,210
Is she a 15-year-old
pharmacist?

522
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,590
Or just some kid
from down the street

523
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,020
who needed 20 bucks
for lip gloss

524
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,220
and a couple of <i>Tiger Beats?</i>

525
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,100
Put your kid
on charcoal hemoperfusion.

526
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,830
Shouldn't we see
what the babysitter
has to say?

527
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,230
I know what she's gonna say.

528
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,730
She's gonna lie
to save her business.

529
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,460
I need more pills.

530
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,300
We are going
to use this machine
to clean your blood.

531
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,510
It goes out of you
and through a filter,

532
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,810
like the filter
in a fish tank.

533
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,810
It's kind of cool, actually.

534
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,790
I'm scared.

535
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,790
It won't hurt.

536
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,630
It takes a while,
so it'll be boring,
but it won't hurt.

537
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,640
It's going to
make you better.

538
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,140
They hate each other,
don't they?

539
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,910
We're never going
to be together again.

540
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,980
Well, you never know.

541
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,560
You're going to break
out the rubber hoses,
the bright lights?

542
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,400
I'm not going to testify
just because I have
to borrow lunch money.

543
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,300
I know.
Women don't give up guys
that they're in love with.

544
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,540
I'm not in love with House.

545
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,840
The guy is
unhinged and unethical,

546
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,510
does what he wants
with no concern for others,

547
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,070
but you stand by him.

548
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,480
It can't just be
loyalty and respect?

549
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,250
No.

550
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm a girl, so I must
be in love with him.

551
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,180
Not because you're a girl.

552
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,680
Because 10 years ago

553
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,390
you got an A in calculus,
until you ratted yourself out.

554
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,430
Showed your professor
a mistake he missed.

555
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,870
Because you married a man...

556
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,400
Don't go there.

557
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,170
You used to be someone
who did the right thing.

558
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,080
House has changed you.

559
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,480
Do you think it's all
been for the better?

560
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,890
How's it going?

561
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,060
Boring.

562
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,600
Told you.
FOREMAN: So far so good.

563
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,430
Just like five minutes ago,
and 10 minutes before that.

564
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,200
What's the matter?

565
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,770
(WHIMPERING)

566
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,710
(YELLING)

567
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,670
She's thrown a clot.

568
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,140
Let's get her out of here.
I'll call the OR.

569
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,310
You said it wouldn't hurt.

570
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,820
(YELLING)

571
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,960
Found it.
She's burning up.

572
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,090
Give me a sec.

573
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,320
Foreman, she is on fire.

574
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,420
Almost there.

575
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,760
Get me some
cooling blankets now.

576
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,200
Right away.

577
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,200
Every time we touch this kid,
something goes wrong.

578
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,570
Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.

579
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,840
You really have to
flash your private stash
in front of me?

580
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,910
You find it
easier to lie for me
if it's more subtle?

581
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,070
Fine.

582
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,910
You told your associates
that I had
frozen your accounts.

583
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,050
Yes.

584
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,460
Smart lie.

585
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,620
You figured they'd
think there was a reason
that you'd been singled out.

586
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,500
Like that you'd agreed
to testify against House.

587
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,600
Yeah, I assume
that's why you did it.

588
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:01,230
You have a reputation
as a bit of an opportunist.

589
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,440
You already gave
your boss up once
from what I heard.

590
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,070
To save my job.

591
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,800
He goes down now,
I lose my job.

592
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,820
You lose your job,
you find another one.

593
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,440
You get fired,

594
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,440
your chances
don't look so hot.

595
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,780
Why would he fire me?

596
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,050
Because you rolled on him.

597
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,520
I haven't rolled on him.

598
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,060
I think you will.

599
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,890
And he's gonna
think you already did.

600
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,260
As far as he knows,

601
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,330
my accounts are frozen
just like everyone else's.

602
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,460
In 24 hours, all three
of you will have access
to your accounts again.

603
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,270
Why would you do...

604
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,910
If I was looking
at this as an outsider,

605
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,370
I would say

606
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,740
it was because
Detective Tritter had

607
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,380
what appeared to be
a very pleasant lunch
with Dr. Chase.

608
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,150
(TRITTER CHUCKLING)

609
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,680
(SIGHING)

610
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,490
Yeah.

611
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,790
The two of them appear
to be working together.

612
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,530
CUDDY: How the hell are
there no ice packs
in the OR?

613
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,670
Clot's out.

614
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,800
Ice packs aren't
gonna hold it for long.

615
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,870
FOREMAN:
Where are the blankets?

616
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,210
CUDDY: In the ER.

617
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,580
They're dealing with
a four-car collision.

618
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,110
We need to cool this kid down
before her brain melts.

619
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,390
What are you doing?

620
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,390
She got a major
dose of heparin

621
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,720
to thin her blood
for the procedure.

622
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,590
Could have induced
thrombocytopenia.

623
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,930
That's unlikely.

624
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,760
The charcoal
would have absorbed
a lot of the heparin.

625
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,330
She's been anemic.

626
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,990
Could be
a primary blood disorder.

627
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,900
Or we never
cured the infection.

628
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,570
Are you saying
she never had Reye's?

629
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,910
We just put that
little girl through
excruciating pain.

630
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,140
The pain wasn't
House's fault.

631
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,370
Even if
the clot was a reaction

632
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,670
to what we gave her,
we still had to...

633
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,150
I don't need you
to cover my ass!

634
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,310
What I need is my Vicodin!

635
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,690
Two pills every six hours,
like I'm on an allowance.

636
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,550
She's giving a cop leverage
over medical decisions.

637
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,320
What the hell?
Why don't we get

638
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,190
a plumber in here,
ask his opinion?

639
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,090
Hey, Cuddy,
you know any rodeo clowns
who can weigh in...

640
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,870
Where the hell is she?

641
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,440
Look at her arm.

642
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,280
I told you it
was an infection.

643
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,610
We fixed the infection.

644
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,910
Well, apparently not.

645
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,210
I asked you for
broad-spectrum.

646
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,580
You put her on
the bare minimum.

647
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,890
It's a good thing you failed
to become a mom,
because you suck at it.

648
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,010
What's so good
about this rash?

649
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,540
Good guesses, but no.

650
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,290
It's on parts of her body
that we haven't touched.

651
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,920
She's got a fever of 103.
She's in and out
of consciousness,

652
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,090
but it's not
a reaction to anything we did.

653
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,860
Our mojo is off the table.

654
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,420
Which means...

655
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,000
Oh, so close.

656
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,670
Means thanks to Cuddy's
candy-ass approach,

657
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,010
broad-spectrum antibiotics
are no longer an option.

658
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,970
This thing has
grown horns and fangs.

659
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,640
We've gotta figure
out what species it is,

660
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,010
go in with a spear
to the heart.

661
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,250
Okay, you guys are sulking.

662
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,290
I don't really care why,
but apparently

663
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,390
I can't do my job
without finding out.

664
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,980
Tritter released
our bank accounts.

665
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,390
Horrible, horrible news.

666
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Wow, I'm glad we didn't
let that fester.

667
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,620
If she did have Reye's,
then it could

668
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,290
be varicella.
They're associated.

669
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,670
He released our money.

670
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,100
You do know what that means?

671
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,110
The correct question is,

672
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,770
how could it be varicella
given that she's not itchy?

673
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,110
Rickettsial pox causes rash,
fever and muscle pain.

674
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,580
CAMERON: Pain, not paralysis.

675
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,410
Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
on the other hand,

676
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,280
rash, fever,
anemia, paralysis.

677
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,610
And I didn't say
anything to Tritter.

678
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,020
Neither did I.

679
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,820
Maybe he wants us to think
that one of us talked.

680
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,480
It worked.
You were with him.

681
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,620
We were all with him.

682
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,250
We weren't laughing with him.

683
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,920
Maybe he just gave up.

684
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,960
Start the kid on
chloramphenicol

685
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,070
for Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.

686
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,930
Can we talk?

687
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,970
No.
I really think we...

688
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,030
Either you screwed me

689
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,800
and you want absolution,
or you didn't and
you want applause.

690
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,180
Either way,
I'm not interested.

691
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,960
I'm busy.

692
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,990
You okay?

693
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,050
Yeah, sure.

694
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,260
What I meant by
"Are you okay?"

695
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,530
Is "What
the hell did House do?"

696
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,570
Nothing.
What did he say?

697
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,600
I've seen House be rude
1,000 times,
usually to achieve something.

698
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,370
I have never seen him be mean
just because he can.

699
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,280
Seriously?

700
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,550
What did he say?

701
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,880
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

702
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,060
Well, I've seen
House be rude to you
1,000 times,

703
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,490
but I've never seen it
get to you.

704
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,690
People think House
has no inner censor,

705
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,100
but the fact is he
holds himself back.

706
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,330
Because when he
wants to hurt,

707
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,630
he knows just where
to poke a sharp stick.

708
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,910
I have been trying
to get pregnant,
and House knew.

709
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,670
He told me I would
fail as a mother.

710
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,920
And you're this upset
because you think he's right?

711
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,880
I've had three
separate implantations.

712
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,950
The first two never took.

713
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,990
The last one, I lost.

714
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,190
I'm sorry.

715
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,730
You didn't fail.
Those were physical events.

716
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:02,390
A little girl is scared
and in pain.

717
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,470
I was awkward,
terrified of
doing the wrong thing.

718
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,910
That's normal. That's...

719
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,140
I didn't hug her.

720
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,470
I didn't even reach out
and hold her hand.

721
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,210
I told her it
was gonna be okay.

722
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,510
She needed reassurance.

723
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,640
I told her, her folks
might get back together.

724
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,880
When I see people
with their kids,
it's so natural.

725
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,530
It's like they have
an instruction book
imprinted on their genes.

726
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,460
Maybe I just
didn't get a copy.

727
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,660
Maybe my wanting to
be a mother is like

728
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,870
a tone-deaf person
wanting to sing opera,

729
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,670
or a paraplegic
who wants to...

730
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

731
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,710
Well, I see what you mean
about House poking
the right spot.

732
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,370
Chloramphenicol
isn't working.

733
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,910
What dose
did you give her?

734
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,180
Yeah, maybe Chase
screwed up.

735
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,220
You always end up there.

736
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,840
Just getting a jump on it.

737
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,550
I doubled her up.

738
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,430
The infection's morphed.

739
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,820
It's moved into
her muscle sheath.

740
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,690
Necrotizing fasciitis?

741
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,460
That's impervious to drugs.

742
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,560
The only treatment
is to cut away
the infected area.

743
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,830
So, we amputate.

744
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,340
Arm and leg?

745
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,310
CAMERON: We can't cut
a six-year-old kid in half

746
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,380
without a confirmed diagnosis.

747
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,240
Moves too quickly,
and we waited too long.

748
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,940
We don't have
time for a culture.

749
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,780
We can at least observe her
for a few hours,

750
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,650
confirm the rash is spreading.

751
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,020
It spreads, she dies.

752
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,820
You're talking
about crippling her.

753
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,090
We're not even certain
this was an infection.

754
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,490
Right! She's six!
She's cute!

755
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,000
She can't have
flesh-eating bacteria!

756
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,030
It's just wrong!

757
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,930
Let's cure her
with sunshine and puppies.

758
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,070
Cute kids die of
terrible illnesses,
innocent doctors go to jail,

759
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,840
and it's because
cowards like you

760
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,670
won't stand up
and do what's required.

761
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,740
You can sit around
and moan about
who's the bigger weakling.

762
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,750
I'm going to go do my job.

763
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,930
<i>EDIE.: What kind of quality</i>
<i>of life will she have</i>
<i>without...</i>

764
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,530
<i>HOUSE.: Great thing about life,</i>
<i>it's got qualities.</i>

765
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,170
<i>MR. HARTMANN.:</i>
<i>And if we can't agree?</i>

766
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,810
CUDDY: I don't know.

767
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,940
He's yelled at us before.

768
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,380
Because he thought
our theories were dumb.

769
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,140
Not because our theories
were sending him to jail.

770
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,810
He's going
through withdrawal.

771
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,540
Could be causing
mild paranoia.

772
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,480
It'll pass. We just
have to suffer through it.

773
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,680
We never ruled out allergy.

774
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,590
We gave her drugs.
She had no negative reaction.

775
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,890
We cut open her belly,
she got a rash on her belly.

776
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,590
We did a scratch test
on her back,
she got a rash on her back.

777
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,150
I know House ruled out mojo,
but it can't be
a coincidence...

778
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,200
A little late to
play differential games,
isn't it?

779
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,260
Get that thing away
from me.

780
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,390
I don't want to get burned.

781
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,490
Laser pointers
don't burn you, genius.

782
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,040
Skin, no. Retina, yes.

783
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,970
You don't trust my aim?

784
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,010
Maybe you should
cover any sensitive...

785
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,280
He was wrong
about the puppies.

786
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,480
House! You got to stop
the surgery.

787
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,250
She doesn't have
necrotizing fasciitis.

788
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,320
Oh, good.

789
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,090
She's got
erythropoietic protoporphyria.

790
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,960
She's allergic to light.

791
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,660
It's genetic.
Either parent
could have carried it.

792
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,890
I know what it is.
Infection fits better.

793
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,060
She gets worse
every time she goes
under surgical lights,

794
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,370
dad takes her outside...

795
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,770
Her liver's shot, too.

796
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,270
Did she swallow a flashlight?

797
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,500
Stop the surgery.

798
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,840
Get the hell out of my way.

799
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,900
No, I'm...

800
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,850
Light damages
the blood cells,

801
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,480
the damaged
blood cells contain
protoporphyrin,

802
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,390
the protoporphyrin
builds up in the liver.

803
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,090
That's why
the liver's shutting down.

804
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,150
(PHONE RINGING)

805
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,350
Stop.

806
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,160
How can she be
allergic to light?

807
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,030
She's never had
this problem before.

808
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,470
The negative reaction
starts at birth.

809
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,970
It reaches critical mass
around this age.

810
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,330
<i>CUDD Y.: Her blood cells</i>
<i>create chemicals</i>
<i>in reaction to light.</i>

811
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,570
<i>When they reach the liver,</i>
<i>it tries to filter</i>
<i>out the bad cells.</i>

812
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,710
<i>The chemicals</i>
<i>damage the liver,</i>

813
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,910
<i>and one</i>
<i>byproduct is gallstones.</i>

814
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,420
So, she'll just
keep getting worse?

815
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,010
EP can be managed.

816
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,720
We'll give her beta-carotene.

817
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,890
She's gonna need
special light bulbs
and filters on the windows.

818
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,660
She's probably gonna need
to be home-schooled.

819
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,190
Her life will be complicated,
but she will live.

820
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,570
How do you get
something like this?

821
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,800
It's genetic.

822
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,360
So, one of us...

823
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,110
Both of you must be carriers.

824
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,620
She's gonna want to see you
when she wakes up.

825
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,780
So, don't screw it up.

826
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,410
So, what's new?

827
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,250
House missed one.

828
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,020
That's happened before.

829
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,890
He nearly maimed
a little girl.

830
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,960
And I got it right.

831
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,790
And I told him,
and it didn't matter.

832
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,030
Chase, you solved one.

833
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,190
You helped a patient,
that better be
enough for you.

834
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,430
Beckett was going
to call his play

835
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,500
<i>Waiting for House's Approval,</i>
but decided it was too grim.

836
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,800
Trust me,

837
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,670
I'm not waiting anymore.

838
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,280
I'm gonna need
30 pieces of silver.
