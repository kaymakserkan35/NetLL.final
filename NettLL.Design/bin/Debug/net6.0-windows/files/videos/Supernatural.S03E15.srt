1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,305
I got a year to live,sam. I'd
like to make the most of it.

2
00:00:02,305 --> 00:00:06,014
What do you say we kill some evil sons
of bitches and we raise a little high?

3
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:10,424
- You didn't tell,dean?
- Tell me what?

4
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:12,629
There's a big new up-And-Comer.
Her name is lilith.

5
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:16,237
She really,really wants
sam's intestines on a stick.

6
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:17,740
Let dean out of his deal right now.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,346
I'm just a saleswoman. I
got a boss like everybody.

8
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:21,649
Who holds the contract?

9
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,053
I can't tell you.

10
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:26,661
Bela talbot's her real name.

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,966
The colt. Bela stole the colt.

12
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:30,069
I want it back,bela.

13
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:32,174
Your little pistol,
you mean? Sorry.

14
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:34,479
You understand how many people
gonna die if you do this?

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,985
Whatxactly is it that you
think i plan to do with?

16
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:39,390
Take the only weapon we have
against an army of demons

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,194
And sell it to the highest bidder.

18
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:42,598
You know nothing about me.

19
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:44,803
- Pack your crap.
- Why? Where are we going?

20
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:46,106
We're gonna go hunt the bitch down.

21
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:48,311
- I don't want to go to hell.
- We'll find a way to save you.

22
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,917
I'm scared,sam. I'm really scared.

23
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,523
And the only person that can
get me out of this thing is me.

24
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:55,226
And me.

25
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:03,044
Erie,pennsylvania

26
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,049
Up for a drink?

27
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:07,455
No,i can't. I got to
be up at the catwn.

28
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:09,259
Duty calls.

29
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,361
Boob job?

30
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,969
I wish.Nah,some crabby
old broad wants the works.

31
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,774
I need a forklift to
get it all back up.

32
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:18,580
All that work to have what?
15 minutes off her faces?

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,986
Staying young is a brutal business.

34
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,374
Hey!

35
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:05,889
Help!

36
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:07,893
??? Out of here!

37
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:09,597
Help!

38
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:22,326
Sir?

39
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,231
Please.

40
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,837
It's okay,sir. Let
me see what happened.

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,347
Don't you worry. There's
nothing i haven't seen.

42
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:32,750
No. No. No.

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,356
- Let me see.
- No

44
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:46,382
Supernatural s03e15

45
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:51,994
Stop!

46
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:54,199
You ready to talk?

47
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:57,607
I don't know.

48
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,311
I don't know anything!

49
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,416
Oh,hat,sam? He
doesn't know anything.

50
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,719
Yeah,i heard.

51
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,922
I'm telling you the truth.

52
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:05,225
Oh,you are?

53
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:07,530
My god,then i owe you an apology.

54
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,334
Allow me to make it up to you.

55
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:19,357
I'm gonna ask you
one last time --

56
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,662
Who holds my contract?!

57
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:35,294
Your mother.

58
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:41,007
Yeah,she,uh,showed it to me
right before i bent her over.

59
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,920
I want a name

60
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,927
- Or else
- Or what,hmm?

61
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:53,235
You're gonna squirt your
holy water in both ends?

62
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:54,839
Please.

63
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:57,244
Brother,that's like a fleabite
compared to what's coming to me

64
00:03:57,244 --> 00:04:00,151
If i tell you jack.

65
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:03,559
Do what you want.

66
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:07,668
The only thing i'm scared is
the demon holding your ticket.

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,598
Exorcizamus te.

68
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,901
Omnis immundus spiritus.

69
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,006
How does that feel?
Does that feel good?

70
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,015
Go ahead.

71
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:31,523
Send me back to hell...

72
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:34,129
'Cause when you get there,
i'll be waiting for you...

73
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,935
With a few pals who are
dying for a nice little meet

74
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,541
And greet dean winchester.

75
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:43,350
Should i?

76
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,655
??? Him someplace he
can't hurt anyone else.

77
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:48,762
????

78
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:51,869
Omnis incursio
infernalis adversarii...

79
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,578
Omnis legio, omnis congregatio...

80
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,783
Et secta diabolica.

81
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:00,990
You ran the prints twice?

82
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,995
Are you sure?

83
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:07,906
Okay. Yeah,just chalk
it up to lab error.

84
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,412
Don't i know it.Okay.

85
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:12,316
Thanks. Yeah, i'll
tell the lieutenant.

86
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,221
Bury the body?

87
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:15,925
Yeah.???

88
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:19,332
Looks like these demons
ride 'em hard just for kicks.

89
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,043
What was the phone call about?

90
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:26,048
Remember that thing
in the paper yesterday?

91
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:28,253
"Stripper suffocates
dude with thighs"?

92
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:29,456
The other thing.

93
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,360
Right,the guy that
walks into the e.R. Out.

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,164
And kneels over
dead.His stomach's ripped

95
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:35,069
His liver,actually.Anyways,i
just found out

96
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,572
Something pretty damn interesting.

97
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:37,274
What?

98
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:39,479
The dead body covered
in bloody fingerprints --

99
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:40,982
Not the victim's.

100
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:44,190
Okay,great. My man dave caruso
will be stoked to hear it.

101
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,401
Those fingerprints match
a guy who died in 1981.

102
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:51,206
Really?

103
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:52,910
Urwhat are we lking?

104
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,315
Uh,walking dead?
Walking,killing dead?

105
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:56,818
Maybe.

106
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:59,926
Zombies do like the
other other white meat.

107
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,737
Speaking of, what do
you care about zombies?

108
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:05,438
What do you mean?

109
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,142
Well,you've been on soul-Saving
detail for months now.

110
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,047
And we're three weeks
out, and all of a sudden,

111
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,750
You're interested in
some hot zombie action?

112
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,956
Hey,man,you're the one who's
been all gung ho to hunt.

113
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,459
I just thought i'd
be doing you a favor.

114
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,461
Hey,no,no, no,no,no.

115
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:16,965
I didn't say i didn't
want to do it,okay.

116
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:19,972
I mean obviously i want
to hunt some zombies.

117
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,477
Okay,fine,whatever.

118
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,696
Yeah,the rest of
the body was intact.

119
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:33,603
The liver was the
only organ missing.

120
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,006
Now,where the liver was ripped out,

121
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:37,813
Did you happen to
notice any teeth marks?

122
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,318
Can i see your badges?

123
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,022
Of course,sure.

124
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,136
Fine. So you're cops and morons.

125
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:50,141
Excuse me? No,no. We're very smart.

126
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:52,446
The liver was not ripped out.

127
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:02,870
It was removed
-- Surgically --

128
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,077
By someone who knew their
way around a scalpel.

129
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:09,986
Didn't you read my report?

130
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:12,693
Of course we did.
Oh,it was riveting.

131
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:15,299
It was a real page-Turner,
just delightful.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,504
- You done?
- I think so.

133
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,807
Please go away.

134
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,511
- Okay.
- Sure.

135
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,627
What?

136
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:28,830
Noing.

137
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,834
So,that kind of punches a
hole in ourombie theory,huh,

138
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,137
That scalpel thing?

139
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:35,846
Yeah,zombie with skills.
"Dr. Quinn,medicine zombie.

140
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,048
Maybe we're on the
wrong track,dean,

141
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,953
Looking for hacked-Up corpses.

142
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:40,557
What should we be looking for?

143
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:41,759
Survivors.

144
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,967
This isn't zombie lunch.
This is organ theft.

145
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:47,974
I told the cops all
of this yesterday.

146
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:49,677
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

147
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,381
It's just a couple
of questions,sir.

148
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,085
Hey,man.

149
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:55,290
I just got my kidney stolen.

150
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,295
I'm tired.

151
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:58,498
We'll be out of here quick.

152
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:00,001
Don't you want to get the guy?

153
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,707
Will it get me back my kidney?

154
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:05,714
So what's the last
thing you remember?

155
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:08,120
Feeding my meter

156
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,425
He jumped from behind...

157
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:14,033
And then i wakenpped to a table.

158
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:19,346
And then the worst pain you
could possibly imagine,only worse.

159
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:22,653
And then i black out
again -- Thank god.

160
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:24,958
And then i wake up screaming

161
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,163
Ine no-Tell motel

162
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:30,170
In a bathtub full of ice.

163
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,774
Do you remember anything
about the surgery know,

164
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:34,981
What the guy looked like,
any details about the room?

165
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:37,287
Let me think about that.

166
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,389
Yeah...

167
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:41,296
One thing is coming back to me.

168
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:42,599
You know what i remember?

169
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,107
Getting my kidney
cut out of my body!

170
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:53,925
- So,i got a theory.
- Yeah?

171
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,428
Yeah,i talked to
mr. Giggle's doctor.

172
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:58,535
Turns out his incisions
were sewn up with silk.

173
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:00,340
- That's weird.
- Yeah,nowadays it is,

174
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,444
But silk used to be
the sututhf choice

175
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:03,948
Back in the ean y 19th century.

176
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:05,151
It was really problematic.

177
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:07,255
Patients would get
massive infections.

178
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,461
The death rate was insane.

179
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:10,363
- Good times.
- Right,

180
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:12,267
So doctors,they had to
do whatever they could

181
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,071
To keep infections from spreading.

182
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,076
- One way was maggots.
- Dude,i'm eating.

183
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:17,579
It actually kind of
worked because maggots --

184
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,784
They eat bad tissue, and
they leave good tissue.

185
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,488
And get this -- When
they found our guy,

186
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:23,693
His body cavity was
stuffed full of maggots.

187
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:24,896
Dude,i'm eating.

188
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:27,803
All righ let me get this straight.

189
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:29,607
- So,people are getting ganked,right?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:32,112
A little "antiques roadshow"
surgery,some organ theft.

191
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:33,616
But why does ty l sound familiar?

192
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,019
Because you
ard it before --

193
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,826
When you we a kid... from dad.

194
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,438
Doc benton -- Real-Life
doctor, lived in new hampshire.

195
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:46,044
Brilliant and
obsessed with alchemy,

196
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,751
Especially how to live forever.

197
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:51,357
So,in 1816,doc abandons
his practice and --

198
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,762
Right,yeah,nobody hears
from him for like 20 years,

199
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:55,165
And all of sudden, people
start showing up dead.

200
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:58,874
Dead or missing an organ ot a
hand or some other kind of part.

201
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:00,578
'Cause whatever he was
doing was actually working.

202
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:01,680
He just kept on ticking.

203
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,685
Parts would wear out,
he'd replace them.

204
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,990
But i thoughi dad hunted him
down and took his heart out.

205
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,799
Yeah,i guess doc must
have plugged in a new one.

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,004
All right, where's he doi the deed?

207
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:14,710
According to this, bes,ky
about where he sets up his lab.

208
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,118
He likes dense forest with
access to a river or stream

209
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,922
Or some kind of freshwater. Why?

210
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:23,029
Because that's where he
likes to dump the bile

211
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:26,237
And intestines and fecal matter.

212
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:29,845
Lost your appetite yet?

213
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,756
Maybe i can ??? You.

214
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:08,972
No please.

215
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:13,082
No

216
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:23,806
No no.

217
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:36,887
No solicitors.No asking
for donations.No selling???

218
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,329
So?

219
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,334
You called him this morning.

220
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,236
So?

221
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,847
Uh,you told bobby

222
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,551
About a british chick
who made contact with you.

223
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:06,154
And so?

224
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:07,157
You know where she is?

225
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:08,059
Yeah.

226
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,662
Great. Could you tell me
where i could find her?

227
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,066
No.

228
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,168
Course not.

229
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:14,674
Look,rufus,man...

230
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:18,182
Look,let me point
something out to you.

231
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:20,487
You are knocking at my
door, so don't "look,man" me.

232
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,191
I'm not your man.

233
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:25,298
I'm sorry,sir.

234
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:26,802
All right,i'mght,you
a little story.

235
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:28,506
See,once upon a
time, bobby called me,

236
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,911
Asked me to call him if i got
a whiff of this bela talbot.

237
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:33,818
I got a whiff. I called. The end.

238
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:35,722
Okay,yeah,if you could
just tell me where she is,

239
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,827
I mean, that would be great.

240
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:40,333
- Dean winchester,right?
- Yeah.

241
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,640
Dean,do i look like
i'm here to help you?

242
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,843
I'm gonna say no.

243
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,647
Then get the hell of my property.

244
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,351
All right,fair enough.

245
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,656
I got one more
question for you,though.

246
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:54,265
See,i got this,uh
this bottle of scotch,

247
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:57,672
And...is this considered good?

248
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:05,190
Bottoms up.

249
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,702
You know,i don't
even bother drinking

250
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:13,409
Unless it's this stuff.

251
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,516
Nectar of the gods, m telling you.

252
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:18,019
Hey,it's a nice change, you know.

253
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:21,126
Most of my whiskey's
from a plastic jug.

254
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,038
So,bela was here because...

255
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,145
She wanted to buy
a couple of things,

256
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:31,751
Which is gonna take me
some time to round up.

257
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,856
Where is she now?

258
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,965
C-Can i ask you something?

259
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:39,168
Sure.

260
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,473
You got three weeks left.

261
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:43,077
Why are you wasting your time

262
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:47,988
Chasing after that skinny,
stuck-Up english girl?

263
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,897
How do you know about that?

264
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:57,810
Because i know things.

265
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:03,724
I know a lot of things
about a lot of people.

266
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:05,729
Is that so?

267
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:09,738
I know ain't no
peashooter gonna save you.

268
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:14,850
What makes you so sure?

269
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,255
'Cause that's the job,kid.

270
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,062
Even if you manage to
scrape out of this one,

271
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:22,668
There'just gonna be
something else down the road.

272
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,176
Folks like us...

273
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:28,882
There ain't no happy ending.

274
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:31,889
We all t coming.

275
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:38,504
Well,ain't you a
bucket of sunshine?

276
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:46,823
I'm what you've got to look
forward to if you survive.

277
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,634
But you won't.

278
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,141
So,bela...

279
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:40,747
Hotel canaan.

280
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,651
Room 39.

281
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:46,961
But watch your back.

282
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,565
I think i can handle bela.

283
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:50,770
Oh,don't be so sure about that.

284
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:54,378
There are things that
you don't kn about her.

285
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:56,182
Oh,and you do?

286
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:57,385
Right.

287
00:20:57,886 --> 00:20:59,690
Because you know things.

288
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,793
Yep.

289
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,998
And let me guess -- You
lift her fingerprint?

290
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:05,002
Yep.

291
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,606
And that got you jack.

292
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:07,909
Yep.

293
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:12,219
She bux@ed them off.

294
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:14,624
Probably years ago.

295
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:16,328
Yeah,so you're right ere we are.

296
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:17,832
Nope.

297
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,347
You do her ear?

298
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:25,650
Sorry?

299
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,654
You do her ear?

300
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,566
Hey,man,i'll try anything
once,but i don't know.

301
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,871
That sounds uncomfortable.

302
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:40,384
Ears are as unre
to humanso as finge

303
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:41,185
No kidding.

304
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:44,192
Of course,that don't fly
in the courts over here,

305
00:21:44,593 --> 00:21:49,104
But in england,
they're all over it.

306
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:55,017
A friend of a friend... of a friend

307
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:58,024
Faxed me 10 pages
of confidential files

308
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:00,329
Within a day.

309
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:01,632
All i had to send him

310
00:22:01,632 --> 00:22:04,840
Was one clean shot off
the security camera.

311
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:08,147
Right.

312
00:22:08,147 --> 00:22:10,452
One ean shot of her ear.

313
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:29,396
The so-Called bela talbot.

314
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:55,832
Shh! Shh! Shh!

315
00:24:55,832 --> 00:24:57,536
It's okay. I'm here to help you.

316
00:24:57,536 --> 00:25:00,743
I'm here to help you.
Pehere to help you.

00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:06,857
Shh,shh,shh,shh, shh,shh,shh,shh...

318
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:13,773
Shh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay,here we go. Shh.

319
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:17,181
Shh,shh,shh.

320
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:24,197
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

321
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,112
Ok,watch your head.

322
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:17,519
Sorry.

323
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,747
Try to get straight.
Try to get straight.

324
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:16,154
Where's the colt?

325
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:19,261
- Dean.
- No extra words.

326
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:23,170
It's long gone --
Across the world by now.

327
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:25,074
You're lying.

328
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:27,279
I'll call the buyer. Speak farsi?

329
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,387
Now,look
--

330
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,692
Don't flatter yourself.

331
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,801
- Don't move.
- I told you i don't have it.

332
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:40,109
Oh,yeah,i'm definitely
gonna take your word for it.

333
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:51,234
Don't move.

334
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:02,761
It's gone.

335
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:06,068
Get on a plane if you must.

336
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:11,782
Track down the buyer. You might
catch up to him eventually.

337
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:18,597
Are you going to kill me?

338
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,702
Oh,yeah.

339
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:23,408
You're not the cold-Blooded type.

340
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:26,716
You mean like you? That's true.

341
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:29,823
See,i couldn't imagine
killing my parents.

342
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:34,033
- I don't know what you're
talking -- - Yes,you do.

343
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:37,240
You were,what,14?

344
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,545
Folks died in some
shady car accident.

345
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:41,951
Police suspected a
slashed brake line,

346
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:44,256
But it was all too crispy to tell.

347
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,760
Cut to
little bela --

348
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,566
Ohi'm
sorry,abby --

349
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:50,871
Inheriting millions.

350
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:53,177
- How did you ev--
- Doesn't matter.

351
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,640
They were lovely people.

352
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,945
And i killed them.

353
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:25,751
And i got rich.

354
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:28,057
I can't be bothered to give a damn.

355
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,767
Just like i don't care
what happens to you.

356
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:43,893
You make me sick.

357
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:46,298
Likewise.

358
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:14,764
You're not worth it.

359
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:44,833
It worked.

360
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,539
He found me.

361
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,744
No,sam wasn't with him.

362
00:30:50,646 --> 00:30:53,152
But i know where they are.

363
00:30:58,163 --> 00:30:59,867
- Dean?
- Yeah.

364
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:01,972
- Did you get the colt?
- What do you think?

365
00:31:01,972 --> 00:31:03,375
So,does that mean bela is...

366
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,981
No,no,she deserves to
die a dozen times over,

367
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:07,485
- But i couldn't do it.
- Dean.

368
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:08,888
I'm really screwed,sammy.

369
00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:10,692
- No,you're just -
- But you were right.

370
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:12,697
Bela was a goose chase.

371
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:17,808
The colt's gone,and this
time i'm really screwed,sam.

372
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:19,913
Maybe not.

373
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:21,717
Look,i found benton's cabin.

374
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:23,622
- You okay?Was he there?
- Yeah.

375
00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:24,724
- Did you kill him?
- No.

376
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:25,526
What do you mean,"no"?

377
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:26,829
Dean,please just
listen for a second.

378
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:29,736
I found his lab book,
and it has the formula.

379
00:31:29,736 --> 00:31:31,941
- What, the live-Forever
formula? - Yeah.

380
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:32,843
Great,let me guess.

381
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:34,747
I got to drink blood
out of a baby's skull?

382
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:38,055
No,that's the thing --
It's not black magic.

383
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:41,563
There's no blood
sacrifice or anything.

384
00:31:41,563 --> 00:31:43,467
It -- It's just
science,dean.

385
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:46,574
Very,very extremely
weird science,but...

386
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:47,877
Wait,wait,wait. What are
-- What are you saying?

387
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:49,982
You ink... dean,i think
it might be doable.

388
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:51,385
I mean,i know we've
hit a lot of walls,

389
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:54,793
But i-I think this formula
-- I think it might be it.

390
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,698
This could save you.

391
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:58,402
Okay,so,this formula...

392
00:31:58,402 --> 00:32:00,406
Well,i mean,look,look,
we're not in the clear yet.

393
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:02,912
There are still things
that i don't get.

394
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:05,017
Sam?

395
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,532
Sammy!

396
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:21,154
You can relax.

397
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:23,259
It's all gonna be okay.

398
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:25,163
Ain't nothing gonna happen here

399
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:27,368
That you got to worry about,sammy.

400
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:31,377
Your chances of coming out
of this procedure alive --

401
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:33,582
Very,very high.

402
00:32:33,682 --> 00:32:35,787
How do you know my name?

403
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,193
Oh...

404
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:41,200
I know.

405
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:46,211
You think i'm some kind
of monster,don't you?

406
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:50,722
Well,i got to tell you, i
have never done one thing

407
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:52,526
That i did not have to do.

408
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:58,439
This whole eternal-Life thing
is very high-Maintenance.

409
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:03,852
If something goes bad
-- Like my eyes here --

410
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:07,059
You got to replace them.

411
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:13,374
And sometimes things get damaged,

412
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:17,182
Like when your father
cut out my heart.

413
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:18,886
Now,that
--

414
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:22,394
That was very inconvenient.

415
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,508
So,i'm sure that you can understand

416
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,814
All the joy i felt

417
00:33:30,814 --> 00:33:36,126
When i read all about
myself here in his journal.

418
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,447
Kind of makes this whole thing

419
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:50,358
Just feel like some kind
of family reunion,don't it?

420
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:54,769
Well,i guess it's about time

421
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:57,876
That we get this thing started.

422
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:16,619
Shoot all you want.

423
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:37,567
A knife?

424
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:45,886
What part of immortality
do you not understand?

425
00:34:48,993 --> 00:34:52,200
Pity about the heart, though.

426
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,307
It was a brand-New one.

427
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:56,510
Good.

428
00:34:56,911 --> 00:35:00,319
It should be pumping
nice and strong...

429
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:04,930
Sending this stuff
throughout your whole body.

430
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:07,636
See,i picked up your
little bottle upstairs

431
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:09,640
And dipped the knife in it.

432
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:26,479
Oh,hiya,doc.

433
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,586
Wakey,wakey, eggs and bac-Y.

434
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,194
- Please.
- Please what?

435
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:35,299
You've been killing poor
bastards for over 150 years

436
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,003
And now you got a request? Shut up.

437
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:39,308
No,you don't understand.
I can help you.

438
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,012
I know what you need.

439
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:42,616
We might have to cut
him up into little bits.

440
00:35:42,716 --> 00:35:44,821
You know,this immortality
thing is a bitch.

441
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:49,131
I can read the formula for you.

442
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:52,238
The whole
immortality --

443
00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:56,548
Forever young,never die.

444
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:04,566
Dean.

445
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:08,375
Sam.

446
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:15,993
What?

447
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:20,102
I mean,we're talking
hell in three weeks.

448
00:36:20,102 --> 00:36:22,207
Or needing a new pancreas
in like half a century.

449
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:24,011
Yeah,well,you can't exactly
get those at a kwik-E-Mart.

450
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:25,514
It's not perfect, but
it buys us more time

451
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:26,918
To think of something better.

452
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,020
We just need time,dean.

453
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,829
I mean,please,just --
Just think about it.

454
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:36,840
No.

455
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,742
Dean,don't you want to live?

456
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:39,847
What he is isn't living.
Look,this is simple.

457
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:41,150
- Simple?
- To me it is,okay.

458
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,656
Black or white --
Human,not human.

459
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,868
See,what the doc is
is a freakin' monster.

460
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:50,772
I can't do it.

461
00:36:50,772 --> 00:36:52,877
I would rather go to hell.

462
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,586
You don't understand.
I can help you!

463
00:36:59,793 --> 00:37:02,199
Now,i'm gonna take care of him.

464
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,604
You can help me or
not. It's up to you.

465
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:36,377
No! No! No!

466
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:38,181
???

467
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:40,687
I can help you.No.

468
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:44,395
Enjoy forever in there,doc.

469
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:48,405
Let me out.

470
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,015
I can save you.

471
00:37:53,015 --> 00:37:57,425
No.Don't.

472
00:37:58,428 --> 00:37:59,630
No.

473
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:04,742
???

474
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:08,451
No.

475
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:08,388
Hiya,bela.

476
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,693
Here's a fun fact
you may not know --

477
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:12,397
I felt your hand in my pocket

478
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:14,001
When you swiped that motel receipt.

479
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:15,204
You don't understand.

480
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:17,609
Oh,i'm pretty sure i
understand perfectly.

481
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:20,616
You see,i noticed something
interesting in your hotel room,

482
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:22,220
Something tucked above the door.

483
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,227
An herb --
Devil's shoestring.

484
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:28,234
Well,there's only
one use for that --

485
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:30,539
Holding hellhounds at bay.

486
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:33,446
So,you know what i did?I went back,and
i took another look at your folks' obit.

487
00:39:33,446 --> 00:39:36,954
Turns out they died
10 years ago today.

488
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,858
You didn't kill them.

489
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:40,762
A demon did your dirty work.

490
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:44,170
You made a deal, didn't you,bela?

491
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:47,177
And it's come due.

492
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:54,394
I can take care of them for you.

493
00:39:56,398 --> 00:39:59,205
And it won't even
cost you anything.

494
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:04,316
For 10 whole years.

495
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:12,636
Is that why you stole the colt,huh?

496
00:40:12,636 --> 00:40:13,939
To try to wiggle out of your deal?

497
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:16,645
- Our gun for your soul?
- Yes.

498
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:19,351
But stealing the colt wasn't
quite enough,i'm guessing.

499
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:22,057
They changed the deal.

500
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:23,962
They wanted me to kill sam.

501
00:40:23,962 --> 00:40:25,665
Really? Wow.

502
00:40:25,665 --> 00:40:27,570
Demons
untrustworthy --

503
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,973
Shocker.

504
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:31,679
That's kind of a
tight deadline,too.

505
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,982
What time is it?

506
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:36,089
Oh,look at that. Almost midnight.

507
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,796
Dean,listen,i need help.

508
00:40:38,796 --> 00:40:40,299
Sweetheart, we are weeks past help.

509
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,103
I know i don't deserve it.

510
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:43,206
You know what? You're
right. You don't.

511
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,110
But you know what the
bitch of the bunch is?

512
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,317
If you would have just come to
us sooner and asked for help,

513
00:40:48,317 --> 00:40:50,923
We probably could have
taken the colt and saved you.

514
00:40:50,923 --> 00:40:53,730
I know, and saved yourself.

515
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,734
I know about you dean.

516
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:57,037
And who told you that?

517
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,641
The demon that holds it.

518
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,746
She holds mine,too.

519
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:02,450
She says she holds every deal.

520
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,252
She?

521
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,256
Her name's lilith.

522
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:06,559
Lilith?

523
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:10,669
Why should i believe you?

524
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,573
You shouldn't, but it's the truth.

525
00:41:12,573 --> 00:41:15,079
This can't help you,bela. Not now.

526
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:16,883
Why are you telling me this?

527
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:20,591
Because just maybe
you can kill the bitch.

528
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,505
I'll see you in hell.
