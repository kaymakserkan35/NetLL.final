1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,610
Storm's coming.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,520
And you boys, you are
smack in the middle of it.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,240
Dad wants us to pick up where he left
off... saving people, hunting things.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,220
Family business.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,220
I'm gonna save as many people as we can.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,900
Dean, you and I have seen things
most people couldn't even dream about.

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,920
If it's supernatural, we kill it.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,010
End of story. That's our job.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,460
No, Dean, that is not our job.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,860
Our job is hunting evil.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,320
They're all the same, Sam.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,860
They're not human, okay?

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,730
We have to exterminate
every last one of them.

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,450
Our lives are weird, man.

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,410
You're telling me.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,760
We're lost.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,370
No.

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,750
This is a short cut...

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,860
Babe, it's just we've been on this road over
an hour, and we haven't seen a single car.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,240
Molly, I know how to
read a frickin' map, okay?

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,160
We passed a gas station a while back.

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,080
Let's just go ask someone.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,940
That was 40 minutes ago.

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,080
We're not turning around.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,730
Come on.

26
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,460
Isn't this argument a little archaic?

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,970
Men can ask directions these days.

28
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,790
No, we can't.

29
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,030
It's against our genetic code.

30
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,930
Look, I know exactly where we are.

31
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,490
Oh, yeah? Where?

32
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,380
Highway 99, okay?

33
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,980
It cuts right through.

34
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,110
Highway 99, huh?

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,810
Okay, so we're taking the scenic route.

36
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,480
David.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,890
It's our anniversary, and we're
spending it stuck in the car.

38
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:50,970
I know.

39
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,230
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,670
Let me make it up to
you, okay? Come here.

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
Stop. I'm mad at you.

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,780
Oh, come on, Molly.

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,210
Hey, you love me.

44
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,450
No, I don't.

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,070
You're a jerk.

46
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,090
David, I mean it.

47
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,150
Molly!

48
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,400
David?

49
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,640
David?

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,490
David?

51
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,970
David?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,850
Da... David?!

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,110
David?!

54
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,910
David?

55
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,730
Hello?

56
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,830
Is anyone here?

57
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,180
Hello?

58
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,860
It's you.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,330
You're okay.

60
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm so sorry.

61
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,930
I didn't see you there.

62
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,540
Are you...

63
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,270
Are you hurt?

64
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,910
Sir?

65
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,150
Stop!

66
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,350
You've got to help me.

67
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,180
Please.

68
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,150
Please!

69
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,800
All right, all right.

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,250
Calm down, calm down.

71
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,490
Tell us what happened.

72
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,890
I-I swerved,
a-And we crashed.

73
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:51,060
And when I came to, the car was
wrecked and my husband was missing.

74
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,060
I went looking for him, but that's when the
man from the road, he... he started chasing me.

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,170
Did he look like he lost
a fight with a lawn mower?

76
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,230
How did you know that?

77
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,760
Lucky guess.

78
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,070
Ma'am, what's your name?

79
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,180
Molly.

80
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,000
Molly Mcnamara.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,160
I think maybe you should come with us.

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,080
We'll take you back into town.

83
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
I can't.

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,430
I have to find David.

85
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,790
He might have gone back to the car.

86
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,410
We should get you somewhere safe first.

87
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,830
Then Dean and I will come back.

88
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,770
We'll look for your husband.

89
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,230
No.

90
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,390
I'm not leaving here without him.

91
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,870
Would you just take me
back to my car, please?

92
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,190
Of course.

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,530
Come on.

94
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,610
It's right over there.

95
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,820
I don't understand.

96
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,060
I'm sure this is where it was.

97
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,980
W-We hit that tree right there.

98
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,140
This... this doesn't make any sense.

99
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,180
Dean, we got to get out of here.

100
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,820
Greeley could show up at any second.

101
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,630
What are you gonna tell her.

102
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,730
The truth?

103
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,630
She's gonna take off running
in the other direction.

104
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,120
I know it sounds crazy, but
I crashed into that tree.

105
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,500
I don't know who could've taken it.

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,200
It was totaled.

107
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,220
Please. You have to believe me.

108
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,390
Molly, listen, we do believe you.

109
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,520
But that's why we want
to get you out of here.

110
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,240
What about David?

111
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,450
Something must have happened.

112
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,690
I have to get to the cops.

113
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,150
Cops... that's a great idea.

114
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,920
We'll take you down to
the station ourselves.

115
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,130
So just come with us.

116
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,690
It's the best way we can
help you and your husband.

117
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,810
Okay.

118
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,200
We're supposed to be in lake Tahoe.

119
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,930
You and David?

120
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,260
It's our five-Year anniversary.

121
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,580
Hell of an anniversary.

122
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,960
Right before, we were
having the dumbest fight.

123
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,580
It was the only time we ever really
argued... when we were stuck in the car.

124
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,840
Yeah.

125
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,810
I know how that goes.

126
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,380
You know the last thing I said to him?

127
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,640
I called him a jerk.

128
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,630
Oh, god.

129
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,080
What if that's the last
thing I said to him?

130
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,240
Molly...

131
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,130
We're gonna figure out what
happened to your husband.

132
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,620
I promise.

133
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,520
Did you? No.

134
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,440
I was afraid you'd say that.

135
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,550
This song.

136
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
What?

137
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,400
It was playing when we crashed.

138
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,510
She's mine.

139
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,240
She's mine.

140
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,960
She's mine.

141
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,530
What is that?

142
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,390
Hold on.

143
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,560
What are you doing?

144
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,120
What the...

145
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,980
What the hell just happened?

146
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,570
Don't worry, Molly.

147
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,120
Everything's gonna be all right.

148
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,370
Spoke a little too soon, Sammy.

149
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,750
I don't think he's gonna let her leave.

150
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,140
This can't be happening.

151
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,350
Well...

152
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,510
Trust me, it's happening.

153
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,680
Well...

154
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,900
Okay.

155
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,870
Thanks for helping, but I think
I got it covered from here.

156
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,830
Wait.

157
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,730
Molly, Molly, wait a minute.

158
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,780
Just leave me alone.

159
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,980
No. Please. You have to listen to me.

160
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,040
Just stay away.

161
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,500
It wasn't a coincidence
that we found you, all right?

162
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,190
What are you talking about?

163
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,340
We weren't cruising for chicks
when we ran into you, sister.

164
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,580
We were already out here.

165
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,750
Hunting.

166
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,660
Hunting for what?

167
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,590
Ghosts.

168
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,850
D... d... don't...

169
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,760
Sugar coat it for her.

170
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,060
You're nuts.

171
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,220
Really?

172
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,510
About as nuts as a vanishing
guy with his guts spilling out.

173
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,380
You know what you saw.

174
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,680
We think his name is Jonah Greeley.

175
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,440
He was a local farmer that died
15 years ago on this highway.

176
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,720
Just stop.

177
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,460
One night a year, on the anniversary
of his death, he haunts this road.

178
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,150
That's why we're here, Molly.

179
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,490
To try and stop him.

180
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,230
Now, I suppose this ghost
made my car disappear, too.

181
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,800
Crazier things have happened.

182
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,840
Huh?

183
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,570
You know what?

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,910
I'm all filled up on crazy.

185
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,810
I'm gonna get the cops myself.

186
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,340
I don't mean to be harsh, but I
don't think you're gonna get too far.

187
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,630
What is that supposed to mean?

188
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,890
Means that plan "a" was
trying to get you out of here.

189
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,470
Obviously that didn't go over too
well with, uh, farmer road kill.

190
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,880
Molly, we're telling the truth.

191
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,870
Greeley's not gonna let
you leave this highway.

192
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,260
You're s... you're serious
about this, aren't you?

193
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,120
Deadly.

194
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,370
Everyear, Greeley finds someone
to punish for what happened to him.

195
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,270
Tonight that person is you.

196
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,070
Why me?

197
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,790
I didn't do anything.

198
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,040
Doesn't matter.

199
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,590
Some spirits only see what they want.

200
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,560
So you're saying this
Greeley, he took my husband?

201
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,470
Oh, god.

202
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,810
Molly, look, we're
gonna help, all right?

203
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,690
But first, you got to help us.

204
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,100
Help you?

205
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,670
How?

206
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,910
This is it.

207
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,390
This is where I saw him.

208
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,250
Must have been his hunting cabin.

209
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,440
Seemed like a real sweet guy.

210
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,360
No markers or headstones outside.

211
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,010
You're looking for Greeley's grave?

212
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,980
Yeah.

213
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,150
Why?

214
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,520
So we can dig up the
corpse and salt and burn it.

215
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,270
Oh.

216
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,140
Sure. Naturally.

217
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,990
It's a way to get rid of a spirit.

218
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,920
And that'll save David?

219
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,420
This is what'll help both of you,
provided there's a corpse to be found.

220
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,700
So how do we find it?

221
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,740
Uh, not sure.

222
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,890
After Greeley died, his
wife claimed the body.

223
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,660
And that was the last anyone saw of her.

224
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,070
So good guess she brought him back here.

225
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,880
But they have a thousand acres.

226
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,910
He could be buried anywhere on 'em.

227
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,660
Is is really what you guys do.

228
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,180
You're like ghost busters.

229
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,730
Yeah.

230
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,810
Minus the jumpsuits.

231
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,840
This is a fascinating
conversation and all.

232
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,140
But this highway is only haunted once a year,
and we got till sun up to wrap this thing up.

233
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,880
What do you say we move it along, okay?

234
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,510
Great.

235
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,670
What are we looking for?

236
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,040
Greeley's house.

237
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,630
Maybe he's buried there.

238
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,480
Look for roads or paths or something.

239
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,530
Stay close.

240
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,010
Yeah.

241
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,380
Okay.

242
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,320
Molly?

243
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,190
Molly, help me.

244
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,440
Molly?

245
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,090
David? David?

246
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,580
Whoops.

247
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,360
Hey!

248
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,310
Are you all right?

249
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,110
What has that son of a
bit chdone with my husband?

250
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,720
Just take it easy, all right?

251
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,050
You're gonna see David again.

252
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,840
You will.

253
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,060
Hey.

254
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,960
Follow the creepy brick road.

255
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,610
Go ahead.

256
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,860
That thing shoots rock salt?

257
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,300
Yep.

258
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,880
And plain salt keeps away spirits?

259
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,470
Simple remedies are always the best.

260
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,710
In most cultures, salt is a symbol of purity,
so it repels impure and unnatural things.

261
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,890
Same reason you throw
it over your shoulder.

262
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,190
You know, just once I'd like to
round the corner and see a nice house.

263
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,980
Any headstones outside?

264
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,780
Yeah, right.

265
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,160
Is it ever that easy?

266
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,910
I guess not.

267
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,180
You two check upstairs.

268
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,580
See if you can find any notes or
records telling us where he's buried.

269
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,860
I'll just check down here.

270
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,670
Great.

271
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,260
Look at this.

272
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,110
It's Greeley and his wife.

273
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,840
It's a love letter he wrote her.

274
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,510
My god, it's beautiful.

275
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,860
I don't understand how a guy like
this can turn into that monster.

276
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,300
Spirits like Greeley are,uh...

277
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,140
Like wounded animals.

278
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,480
Lost.

279
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,760
In so much pain, that they lash out.

280
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,810
Why?

281
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,090
Why are they here?

282
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,570
Well, there's some part of them that...

283
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,880
That's keeping them here.

284
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,420
Like their remains or, um...

285
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,280
Unfinished business.

286
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,410
Unfinished business?

287
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,700
Yeah.

288
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,850
It could be revenge.

289
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,780
Could be love.

290
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,160
Or hate.

291
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,630
Whatever it is, they
just hold on too tight.

292
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,460
Can't let go.

293
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,170
So they're trapped.

294
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,990
Caught in the same loops.

295
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,450
Replaying the same
tragedies over and over.

296
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,760
You sound almost sorry for them.

297
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,400
Well, they weren't
evil people, you know?

298
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,640
A lot of them were good.

299
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,020
Just...

300
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,490
Something happened to them.

301
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,620
Something they couldn't control.

302
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,650
Sammy's always getting a little J. Love
Hewitt when it comes to things like this.

303
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,940
Me, I don't like 'em.

304
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,190
And I sure as hell ain't
making apologies for 'em.

305
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,650
There's nothing downstairs.

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,320
Uh, just about every piece of
mail or receipt they ever had.

307
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,760
Looked through a couple, but
nothing about a grave so far.

308
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,870
What?

309
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,350
There's something behind here.

310
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,240
Here.

311
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,380
It's locked from the inside.

312
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,190
Smells like old lady in here.

313
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,660
And that would explain why.

314
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,230
Well, now we know why
nobody ever saw her again.

315
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,120
She didn't want to live without him.

316
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,160
Dean, give me a hand.

317
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,520
Really?

318
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
What are you gonna do?

319
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,720
We can't leave her like this.

320
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,840
Why not?

321
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,980
She deserves to be put to rest, Dean.

322
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,330
So...

323
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,210
So, if you manage to put
Greeley to rest, too...

324
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,920
What happens to them?

325
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,100
Lady, that answer is
way beyond our pay grade.

326
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,920
You hunt these things, but you
don't know what happens to them?

327
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,440
Well, they never come back.

328
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,910
That's all that matters.

329
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,810
After they let go of
whatever'skeeping them here, they...

330
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,970
They just go.

331
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,580
I hope someplace better,
but we don't know.

332
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,390
No one does.

333
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,310
What happens when you burn their bones?

334
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,530
Well, my dad used to say that was
like death for ghosts, you know?

335
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,950
But...

336
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,280
The truth is, we still don't know.

337
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,420
Not for sure.

338
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,280
Guess that's why we all
hold on to life so hard.

339
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,050
Even the dead.

340
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,570
We're all just scared of the unknown.

341
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,750
The only thing I'm
scared of is losing David.

342
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,600
I have to see him again.

343
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,840
I have to.

344
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,300
I think we should tell
her about her husband.

345
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,360
We can't.

346
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,990
Dean, it's cruel, letting
her pine for him like this.

347
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,470
I don't like keeping her in the dark.

348
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,730
It's for her own good.

349
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,440
I know you feel guilty,
butlet's just stick to the plan.

350
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,430
Let's get her out of here.

351
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,280
Then we'll tell her.

352
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,440
Tell me what?

353
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,570
What aren't you telling me?

354
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,600
It's about David.

355
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,260
You know what happened to him.

356
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,240
Molly Sam, don't.

357
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,400
Don't what?

358
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,210
Don't tell me because
I'll mess up your hunt?

359
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,040
You don't care about me or my husband.

360
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,370
That's not true.

361
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,440
Really?

362
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,490
Then whatever it is, tell me, please.

363
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,280
He's coming.

364
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,000
Stay with her...

365
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,280
He's got Molly!

366
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,220
This guy is persistent.

367
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,450
We got to find Molly.

368
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,930
We got to find Greeley's bones.

369
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:42,550
And, uh, no pressure or anything, but we
got less than two hours before sunrise.

370
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,940
Hey.

371
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,010
What do you got?

372
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,710
"February 6, 1992. "

373
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,040
That was like two weeks
before the accident, wasn't it?

374
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,860
Yeah.

375
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,810
It looks like the hunting cabin, but...

376
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,440
I swear there's a tree there
right where they're standing.

377
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,340
Should have thought of it.

378
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,450
What?

379
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,830
It's an old country custom, Dean.

380
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,970
Planting a tree as a grave marker.

381
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,580
You're like a walking
encyclopedia of weirdness.

382
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,630
Yeah.

383
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,780
I know.

384
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,770
Where's David?

385
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,980
What did you do to him?

386
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,190
You shouldn't worry about him anymore.

387
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,320
Oh, my god.

388
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,860
You should worry about yourself.

389
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,420
I didn't do anything to you.

390
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,640
Oh?

391
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,990
I know... I know about your wife.

392
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,830
Hurting me won't bring her back.

393
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,370
My wife is gone.

394
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,330
All I got left'shurting you.

395
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,790
P-Please.

396
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,430
Just let me go.

397
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,610
Go?

398
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,300
You're not gonna leave.

399
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,590
You're never gonna leave.

400
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,450
Go get Molly.

401
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,710
Oh, thank god.

402
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,700
Call me Dean.

403
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,200
This guy's really pissing me off.

404
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,040
Oh, baby, it's been a long night.

405
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,360
All right.

406
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,980
Let's get you out of here.

407
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,750
I'm not going anywhere until you
tell me what happened to my husband.

408
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,850
Molly...

409
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,330
All this time I've been looking
for him, and you knew that...

410
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,330
You knew that Greeley
killed him, didn't you?

411
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,500
He's dead.

412
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,250
No, Molly.

413
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,520
David's alive.

414
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,690
What?

415
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,510
You're sure?

416
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,840
I'm sure.

417
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,650
We'll take you to him.

418
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,870
Come on.

419
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,260
He's in that house right there.

420
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,380
I don't understand.

421
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,820
You will.

422
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,690
That's not...

423
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,360
It can't be.

424
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,930
What's happening?

425
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,770
Who is that?

426
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,530
That's David's wife.

427
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,060
I'm sorry, Molly.

428
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:27,640
15 years ago, you and your husband
it Jonah Greeley with your car.

429
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,000
What are you saying?

430
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,940
We're saying there isn't just
one spirit haunting highway 41.

431
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,250
There are two.

432
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,110
Jonah Greeley and you.

433
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,820
For the past 15 years, one night a year
you've been appearing on that highway.

434
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,570
No. That's not possible.

435
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,330
It was our anniversary...
February 22nd...

436
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,830
1992.

437
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,890
Yes.

438
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,360
Molly, it's 2007.

439
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,240
Oh, god.

440
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,090
All right. Tell me about highway 41.

441
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,240
12 accidents over 15 years.

442
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,150
Five of them fatal, all of them
happening on the same night.

443
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,100
So what are we looking
at... interstate dead zone?

444
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,310
Phantom hitchhiker? What?

445
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,250
Not quite.

446
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,420
Year after year, witnesses said
the same thing made 'em crash

447
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,800
A woman appearing in the middle of the
road being chased by a man covered in blood.

448
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,100
Two spooks?

449
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,170
Now, where is Molly buried?

450
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,170
She... she wasn't buried anywhere.

451
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,330
She was cremated.

452
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,640
So much for burning her bones.

453
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,570
Yeah, but then what's keeping her here?

454
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,490
Some spirits only see what they want.

455
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,950
David?!

456
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,450
David?

457
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,140
Stop!

458
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,600
Stop!

459
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,800
You have to help me.

460
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,960
Dean, I don't think
she knows she's dead.

461
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,180
Please!

462
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,270
Open up!

463
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:26,690
Please!

464
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,590
Okay. All right, all right.

465
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,370
Just calm down.

466
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,460
Tell us what happened.

467
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,590
What are you gonna tell her?

468
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,630
The truth.

469
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,280
She's gonna take off running
in the other direction.

470
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,280
Some spirits hold on too tight.

471
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,900
Can't let go.

472
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,400
And Greeley?

473
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,560
Each year he punishes somebody
for his death... chasing them.

474
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,410
Torturing them.

475
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,950
And each year, that somebody is you.

476
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,080
But I don't remember any of it.

477
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,210
Because you couldn't
see the truth, Molly.

478
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,100
So that's why he won't
let me off the highway.

479
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,350
Because...

480
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,120
I killed him.

481
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,220
I killed us both.

482
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,930
Why didn't you tell me
when you first saw me?

483
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,260
Why wait until now?

484
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,980
You wouldn't have believed us.

485
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,870
And you needed me for bait.

486
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,010
Well, we needed you.

487
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,630
David.

488
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,410
Molly, we brought you
here so you could move on.

489
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,920
I have to tell him.

490
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,560
That you love him?

491
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,780
That you're sorry?

492
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,010
Molly, he already knows that.

493
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,130
Look, if you want to go in
there, we're not gonna stop you.

494
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,460
Yeah, but you are gonna
freak him right out.

495
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,020
For life.

496
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,870
David's already said
his good byes, Molly.

497
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,790
Now it's your turn.

498
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,180
This is your unfinished business.

499
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,090
What am I supposed to do?

500
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,530
Just...

501
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,960
Let go.

502
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
Of David.

503
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,260
Of everything.

504
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,730
You do that...

505
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,490
We think you'll move on.

506
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,630
But you don't know where.

507
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,160
No.

508
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,750
Molly, you don't belong here.

509
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,980
Haven't you suffer edlong enough?

510
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,810
It's time.

511
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,240
It's time to go.

512
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,190
I guess she wasn't so bad...

513
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,040
For a ghost.

514
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,810
You think she's really
going to a better place?

515
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,630
I hope so.

516
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,910
I guess we'll never know.

517
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,070
Not until we take the
plunge ourselves, huh?

518
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,450
Doesn't really matter, Dean.

519
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,450
Hope's kind of the whole point.

520
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,100
All right, Haley Joel.

521
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,060
Let's hit the road.
