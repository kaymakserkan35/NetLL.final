1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,840
Storm's coming.
And you boys?

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:06,676
Your daddy?
You are smack in the middle of it.

3
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:14,587
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can!

4
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:16,032
Now, Dean! Go!

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,715
He wants us to pick up
where he left off.

6
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:21,876
Saving people, hunting things...

7
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:23,525
The family business.

8
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:30,952
Our whole lives have been searching
for this demon.

9
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:33,722
Samuel Colt made a gun.

10
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:35,816
They say this gun can kill anything.

11
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:38,584
We finally know who this demon's gonna be,

12
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:40,466
and now, we know how to kill it.

13
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:43,764
More and more demons are walking among us.

14
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:51,656
- You're not my dad.
- Dean, what the hell's going on?

15
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:53,061
I think he's possessed.

16
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,103
My plans for you, Sammy...

17
00:00:56,747 --> 00:00:59,363
You, and all the children like you.

18
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:07,402
It's inside me. I can feel it.
Shoot me!

19
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:09,164
I can't hold on to it much longer!

20
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,294
- Why didn't you kill it?
- we still got the colt.

21
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:16,624
We still have the one bullet left.

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,487
Get back

23
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,723
or I'll kill you.
I swear to god.

24
00:01:57,724 --> 00:01:59,152
You won't.

25
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:02,150
You're saving that bullet for someone else.

26
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,141
You want to bet?

27
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,036
Oh, my god!

28
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:30,311
Dad...

29
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:32,755
- did I do this?
- Dad...

30
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,810
Dean.

31
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:41,293
Dean...

32
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,610
Significant passenger,
space intrusion.

33
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:55,448
Unresponsive.
B.P. 180 over 50.

34
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,717
B.P. 100 over 15.
Heartbeat 95.

35
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:01,232
- Tell me if they're okay!
- you have to stay still.

36
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:02,474
Are they even alive!

37
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:29,412
Sam?

38
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:37,469
Dad?

39
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:40,547
Anybody?!

40
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:50,099
Shadow county, nurses' station.
How can I transfer your call?

41
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,625
Of course.

42
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,042
I transfer your call.

43
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:59,212
Excuse me.

44
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:06,877
Hi.

45
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,609
I, uh... I think I was in a car accident
with my...

46
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,790
dad and my brother.
I just need to find them.

47
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:18,939
Hello?

48
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,213
Sammy...

49
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:11,591
You look good...

50
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,339
considering...

51
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,678
Man, tell me you can hear me.

52
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:28,384
How's dad?

53
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:30,763
Is he okay?

54
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:33,880
Come on, you're the psychic.

55
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:36,586
Give me some ghost whispering or something.

56
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:38,599
Your father's awake.

57
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:41,744
You can go see him if you like.

58
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:43,480
Oh, thank god.

59
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,674
Doc, what about my brother?

60
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:49,344
Well, he sustained serious injury.

61
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:51,656
Blood loss,
contusions to his liver and kidney.

62
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:53,486
But it's the head trauma
I'm worried about.

63
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,616
There's early signs of cerebral edema.

64
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,101
Well, what can we do?

65
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:59,737
Well, we won't know his full condition
until he wakes up.

66
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:02,290
If,

67
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,968
he wakes up.

68
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,092
If?

69
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:06,991
- I have to be honest.
- Screw you, doc I'm waking up!

70
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,599
Most people with his degree of injury
wouldn't have survived this long.

71
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,403
He's fighting very hard.

72
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,101
But you need
to have realistic expectations, son.

73
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:16,053
Come on, Sam.

74
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:18,720
Go find some hoodoo priest
to lay some mojo on me.

75
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:19,866
I'll be fine.

76
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:23,827
Sam?

77
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:27,751
All right. Here.

78
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:30,090
Give them my insurance.

79
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,762
Elroy Mcgillicuddy?

80
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:36,688
And his two loving sons.

81
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,046
So...

82
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:43,924
what else did the doctor say about Dean?

83
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,234
Nothing.

84
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:48,056
Look...

85
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:50,033
if the doctors won't do anything,

86
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,645
then we'll have to, that's all.

87
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:53,297
I don't know. I'll find some...

88
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,711
hoodoo priest and lay some mojo on him.

89
00:06:58,222 --> 00:06:59,911
We'll look for someone.

90
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,347
Yeah.

91
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,564
But, Sam...

92
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,665
I don't know if we're gonna find anyone.

93
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,696
Why not?

94
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,243
I found that faith healer before.

95
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:11,455
- That was one in A million.
- So what?

96
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:13,585
We just sit here with our thumbs up our ass?

97
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:14,907
No, I said we'd look.

98
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:18,855
All right? I'll check under every stone.

99
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:24,389
Where's the colt?

100
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,248
Your son is dying,

101
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,534
- and you're worried about the colt?
- we are hunting

102
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:33,014
this demon, and maybe it's hunting us too.

103
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:35,859
That gun may be our only card.

104
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:38,487
It's in the trunk.

105
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,705
They dragged the car to a yard off of i-83.

106
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:44,985
All right, you got to clean out that trunk
before some junk man sees what's inside.

107
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,422
I already called Bobby.

108
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:49,673
He's like an hour out.
He's gonna tow the Impala back to his place.

109
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:51,093
All right. You,

110
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:53,991
you go meet up with Bobby.
You get that colt and bring it back to me.

111
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:56,148
And you watch out for hospital security.

112
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,584
I think I got it covered.

113
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,467
Hey.

114
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,414
Here.

115
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,235
I made a list of things I need

116
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:12,053
that Bobby pick them up for me.

117
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:14,645
Acacia?

118
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,901
Oil of Abramelin? What's this stuff for?

119
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:18,846
Protection.

120
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:24,553
Hey, dad...

121
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:26,645
You know the demon?

122
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:29,888
He said he had plans
for me and children like me.

123
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,773
You have any idea what he meant by that?

124
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:34,257
No, I don't.

125
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,850
Well, you sure know something.

126
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,839
Oh, man.

127
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,832
Dean is gonna be pissed.

128
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,927
Look, Sam, this...

129
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,930
This just ain't worth a tow.

130
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,552
I say we empty the trunk,
and sell the rest for scrap.

131
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:14,803
No.

132
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,643
Dean would kill me if we did that.

133
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,918
When he gets better,
he's gonna want to fix this.

134
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,851
There's nothing to fix.

135
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,029
The frame's a pretzel. The engine's ruined.

136
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:31,266
There's barely any parts worth salvaging.

137
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,220
Listen to me, Bobby.

138
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:35,366
If there's only one working part,
that's enough.

139
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,013
We're not just gonna give up on...

140
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:43,619
Okay.

141
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,775
You got it.

142
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:48,354
Here...

143
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,454
Dad asked if
you could get this stuff for him.

144
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,828
What John want with this?

145
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,496
Protection from the demon.

146
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:01,944
What?

147
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:04,523
- Nothing. It's just...
- Bobby.

148
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:07,964
What's going on?

149
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:24,929
Come on, dad.

150
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:27,250
You got to help me.

151
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:31,403
I got to get better.
I got to get back in there.

152
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:39,008
I mean, you haven't called a soul for help.

153
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:41,668
You haven't even tried.

154
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,008
Aren't you gonna do anything?

155
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,375
Aren't you gonna even say anything?!

156
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:51,168
I've done everything
you have ever asked me.

157
00:10:51,913 --> 00:10:53,186
Everything.

158
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:55,311
I've given everything I've ever had.

159
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:59,580
Now you're just gonna sit there?
You're gonna watch me die?

160
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:03,896
I mean, what the hell
kind of father are you?!

161
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:12,794
What is that?

162
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,497
I take it you didn't see that.

163
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:51,879
Hey!

164
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,448
I need some help in here!

165
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,231
I can't...

166
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:58,292
breathe.

167
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,792
Sammy, tell me
you can freaking hear me, man.

168
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:12,926
There's something in the hospital.

169
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,342
Now, you got to bring me back,
and we got to hunt this thing.

170
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,826
Sam!

171
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:17,915
You're quiet.

172
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:24,509
You think I wouldn't find out?

173
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,186
- What are you talking about?
- That stuff from Bobby.

174
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:29,111
You don't use it to ward off a demon.
You use it to summon one.

175
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:30,696
You're planning on bringing
the demon here, aren't you?

176
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,890
Having some stupid macho showdown!

177
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:35,709
- I have A plan, Sam.
- That's exactly my point!

178
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,443
Dean is dying, and you have a plan!

179
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:39,958
You know what?!
You care more about

180
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,317
killing this demon than you do
saving your own son!

181
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:44,226
- No, no, no. Guys, don't do this!
- Do not tell me how I feel!

182
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:46,883
- I am doing This for Dean.
- How?

183
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:48,599
How is revenge gonna help him?

184
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,537
You're not thinking about
anybody but yourself!

185
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,810
It's the same selfish obsession!

186
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:54,268
- Come on, guys, don't do this!
- That's funny,

187
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:56,415
I thought this was your
obsession too. This demon

188
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,799
killed your mother,

189
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,069
killed your girlfriend.
You begged me to be part of this hunt!

190
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,571
Now, if you killed that damn
thing when you had the chance,

191
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,748
- none of This would have happened.
- It was possessing you, dad!

192
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:06,859
- I would have killed you, too!
- Yeah,

193
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,579
and your brother would
be awake right now.

194
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,439
- Shut up, both of you!
- go to hell.

195
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,825
I should have never taken
you along in the first place.

196
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,317
- I knew It was A mistake.
- I said "shut up!"

197
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,647
Dude, I full-on swayzed that mother.

198
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,172
What is it?

199
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:39,579
Something's going on out there.

200
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,255
- all clear?
- Clear.

201
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,628
- still No pulse.
- no.

202
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,038
Still no pulse.

203
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,538
- Okay, let's go again. 360.
- Charging.

204
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,139
- all clear?
- Clear.

205
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,792
- Come on, Come on...
- still No pulse.

206
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:00,678
Clear.

207
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,759
- still Nothing.
- Okay, let's go again.

208
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:08,067
Charging.

209
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:08,871
All clear?

210
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:11,303
Get the hell away from me.
Stay back!

211
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,729
There's no change. Starting CPR.

212
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,971
I said get back!

213
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,347
Still nothing.

214
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,242
We have a pulse.

215
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:34,704
We're back into sinus rhythm.

216
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,383
Don't worry, Sammy.

217
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:54,749
I'm not going anywhere.

218
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,071
I'm getting that thing
before it gets me.

219
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:01,300
It's some kind of spirit,

220
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,161
but I could grab it.

221
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,887
And if I can grab it,

222
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:06,470
I can kill it.

223
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,526
Can't you see me?!

224
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,606
Why won't you look at me?!

225
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,033
Now what?

226
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:35,195
Somebody talk to me!

227
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:38,203
- Say something, please!
- Can you see me?

228
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:39,988
Yeah.

229
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:45,455
All right, just calm down.

230
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:46,540
What's your name?

231
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,703
Tessa.

232
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:49,782
Okay, good, Tessa. I'm Dean.

233
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,515
What's happening to me?

234
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:53,588
Am I...

235
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:54,875
Am I dead?

236
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:56,330
That sort of depends.

237
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:08,607
I don't understand.

238
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,684
I just came in for an appendectomy.

239
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:14,656
I hate to bear bad news, but...

240
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,294
I think there were some complications.

241
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,938
It's just a dream, that's all.

242
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,387
This is just

243
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:25,191
a very weird,

244
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,177
unbelievably vivid dream.

245
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:28,653
Tessa,

246
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,150
it's not a dream.

247
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:31,639
Then what else could it be?

248
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,850
You ever heard of an
Out-Of-Body experience?

249
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,848
What are you, some New-Agey guy?

250
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:41,463
You see me messing with
crystals or listening to Yanni?

251
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,009
It's actually a very old idea.

252
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:47,363
It's got a lot of different names.

253
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,050
Bilocation,

254
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,314
crisis apparitions, fetches.

255
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:53,252
I think it's happening to us.

256
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:54,496
If it is...

257
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,553
it means that we're spirits...

258
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:00,124
of people close to death.

259
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,298
So we're gonna die?

260
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:05,159
No.

261
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,310
Not if we hold on.

262
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:10,020
Our bodies can get better. You can
snap right back in there and wake up.

263
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,319
What do you mean you felt something?

264
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,888
I mean, it felt like...

265
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:18,692
like Dean.

266
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,598
Like he was there, just
out of eyeshot or something.

267
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,295
I don't know if it's
my psychic thing or what.

268
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,707
But do you think it's even possible?

269
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,372
Do you think his spirit could be around?

270
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,529
Anything's possible.

271
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,135
Well, there's one way to find out.

272
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,286
- where are you going?
- I got to

273
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,970
- pick something up. I'll be back.
- Wait, Sam.

274
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:39,447
I promise

275
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:41,105
I won't hunt this demon.

276
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,606
Not until we know Dean's okay.

277
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,517
I got to say, I'm impressed.

278
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:52,346
- With what?
- You.

279
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:54,641
Most people in your spot
would be jello by now, but

280
00:17:54,642 --> 00:17:56,309
you're taking this pretty well.

281
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,129
Maybe a little better than me.

282
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,597
Don't get me wrong,

283
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:02,015
I was pretty freaked at first. But

284
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:04,097
now I don't know. Maybe I'm dealing.

285
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:05,582
So you're okay with dying?

286
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,632
No, of course not.

287
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,643
I just think whatever's
gonna happen is gonna happen.

288
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:13,734
It's out of my control. It's just...

289
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:14,959
fate.

290
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:18,823
That's crap.

291
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:22,036
You always have a choice.

292
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,321
You can either roll over and die, you
can keep fighting no matter what...

293
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:27,391
Room 237. Code blue. Dr. Christie

294
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:29,324
- Dean, where are you going?
- Just Wait here.

295
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,627
Give me another amp of epi, please.

296
00:18:46,945 --> 00:18:48,883
Get away from her!

297
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:49,809
Still nothing.

298
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:58,162
All right. Let's call it.

299
00:18:58,867 --> 00:18:59,964
Time of death...

300
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:01,798
5:11 p.m.

301
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,108
At least she's not suffering anymore.

302
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:22,777
Hey.

303
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,979
I think maybe you're around.
And if you are,

304
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:29,619
don't make fun of me for this,

305
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
but, um...

306
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,729
But there's one way we can talk.

307
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:40,911
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

308
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,215
Dean?

309
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,889
Dean, are you here?

310
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,968
God, I feel like I'm at a slumber party.

311
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:14,911
All right, Sam.

312
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,931
This isn't gonna work.

313
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,335
I'll be damned.

314
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:39,741
Oh, it's good to hear from you, man.

315
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:42,660
It hasn't been the
same without you, Dean.

316
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:43,913
Damn straight.

317
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,077
All right.

318
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,400
Dean, what?

319
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:54,788
H...

320
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,032
u...

321
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:04,737
hunt?

322
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:06,117
What, "hunting"?

323
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:07,551
Are you hunting?

324
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:14,280
Dean, it's in the hospital,
what you're hunting?

325
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:16,000
Do you know what it is?

326
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:19,013
One question at a time, dude.

327
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,247
What is it?

328
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:27,413
I don't think it's killing people.

329
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:29,331
I think it's taking them...

330
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:31,777
you know, when...

331
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,233
when their time is just up.

332
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:38,194
A reaper...

333
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,135
Is it after you?

334
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:53,672
If it's here naturally,

335
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,569
there's no way to stop it.

336
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:58,948
Yeah, you can't kill death.

337
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:01,397
Man, you're, uh...

338
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:02,475
I'm screwed, Sam.

339
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:08,500
No. No, no, no.

340
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,254
There's got to be a way.

341
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:12,595
There's got to be a way.

342
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:14,780
Dad will know what to do.

343
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:24,966
Dad?

344
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:18,054
Hey, so dad wasn't in his room.

345
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:19,195
Where is he?

346
00:23:19,196 --> 00:23:22,090
But I got dad's journal, so...

347
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:24,137
Who knows? Maybe there's
something in here.

348
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,053
Thanks for not giving up on me, Sammy.

349
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,225
Son of a bitch.

350
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:03,240
Hi, Dean.

351
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:06,421
You know, you read the
most interesting things.

352
00:24:07,215 --> 00:24:09,580
For example, did you know that reapers

353
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,487
can alter human perception?

354
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:14,440
I sure didn't.

355
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:19,322
Basically they can make themselves
appear however they want...

356
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:21,529
Like, say...

357
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:23,387
a pretty girl.

358
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,402
You're much prettier than
the last reaper I met.

359
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:29,574
I was wondering when
you'd figure it out.

360
00:24:30,863 --> 00:24:32,260
I should have known.

361
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:37,875
That whole "accepting fate" rap of yours
is far too laid-back for a dead chick.

362
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,612
But, you know, the mother and the body...
I'm still trying to figure that one out.

363
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,725
It's my sandbox.

364
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:45,459
I can make you see whatever I want.

365
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,628
What is this, like a
turn-on for you, huh?

366
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:50,351
- Toying With me?
- You didn't give me much choice.

367
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:52,697
You saw my true form,
and you flipped out.

368
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:55,508
Kind of hurts a girl's feelings.

369
00:24:57,218 --> 00:25:00,265
This was the only way I
could get you to talk to me.

370
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,250
Okay, fine.

371
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:02,804
We're talking.

372
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,162
What the hell do you want to talk about?

373
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,653
How death is nothing to fear.

374
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,493
It's your time to go, Dean.

375
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,483
And you're living on
borrowed time already.

376
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:13,146
What the hell are you
doing down here, buddy?

377
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:14,544
- I Can explain.
- Yeah?

378
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:17,733
You're gonna explain to security.
Come on. You follow me.

379
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:19,795
Hey.

380
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:23,190
How stupid you think I am?

381
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:28,602
You really want an
honest answer to that?

382
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:42,675
You conjuring me, John? I'm surprised.

383
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:44,696
I took you for a lot of things,

384
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:48,586
but suicidally reckless
wasn't one of them.

385
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:51,408
I can always shoot you.

386
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,066
You could always miss.

387
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:56,824
And you only got one try, don't you?

388
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,632
Did you

389
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:03,040
really think you could trap me?

390
00:27:04,193 --> 00:27:05,648
Oh, I don't want to trap you.

391
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:11,623
I want to make a deal.

392
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:19,968
Dean, are you here?

393
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,174
Couldn't find anything in the book.

394
00:27:28,766 --> 00:27:30,316
I don't know how to help you.

395
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:35,199
But I'll keep trying, all right?

396
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:37,642
As long as you keep fighting.

397
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:42,465
I mean, come on, you can't...

398
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,321
You can't leave me here alone with dad.
We'll kill each other. You know that.

399
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:56,363
Dean, you got to hold on.

400
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:00,929
You can't go, man, not now.

401
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:05,483
We were just starting
to be brothers again.

402
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:10,739
Can you hear me?

403
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:14,672
Look, I'm sure you've
heard this before, but...

404
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:18,920
You got to make an exception.
You got to cut me a break.

405
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:21,131
Stage 3.

406
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,296
Bargaining.

407
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,287
I'm serious.

408
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:29,701
My family is in danger.

409
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:32,479
See, we're kind of in
the middle of this, uh...

410
00:28:33,032 --> 00:28:34,989
war.

411
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,626
- and they need me.
- The fight's over.

412
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:40,182
- No, it isn't.
- It is for You.

413
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:42,516
Dean...

414
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:45,399
you're not the first soldier
I've plucked from the field.

415
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,423
They all feel the same.

416
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,969
They can't leave.

417
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,444
Victory hangs in the balance.

418
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:53,675
But they're wrong.

419
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:57,293
- the battle goes on without them.
- My brother,

420
00:28:57,294 --> 00:28:58,896
he could die without me.

421
00:28:58,897 --> 00:29:00,311
Maybe he will.

422
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:02,468
Maybe he won't.

423
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,406
Nothing you can do about it.

424
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,768
It's an honorable death,

425
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,003
a warrior's death.

426
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,476
I think I'll pass on
the 72 virgins, thanks.

427
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,269
I'm not that into prude chicks anyway.

428
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,882
That's funny.

429
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:24,251
You're very cute.

430
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:28,259
There's no such thing
as an honorable death.

431
00:29:29,224 --> 00:29:32,506
My corpse is gonna rot in the
ground, and my family is gonna die.

432
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:36,620
No.

433
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,427
I'm not going with you.
I don't care what you do.

434
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:45,498
Well,

435
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:46,932
like you said...

436
00:29:47,944 --> 00:29:49,947
There's always a choice.

437
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:52,015
I can't make you come with me.

438
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,672
But,

439
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:56,280
you're not getting back in your body.

440
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,543
And that's just facts.

441
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,718
So, yes,

442
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,051
you can stay.

443
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,906
You'll stay here for years...

444
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,856
Disembodied.

445
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:07,189
Scared.

446
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,949
And over the decades, it'll
probably drive you mad.

447
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,019
Maybe you'll even get violent.

448
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,627
What are you saying?

449
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,740
Dean.

450
00:30:17,578 --> 00:30:19,893
How do you think angry spirits are born?

451
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:22,718
They can't let go,

452
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,664
and they can't move on.

453
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:26,624
And you're about to become one.

454
00:30:27,457 --> 00:30:29,389
The same thing you hunt.

455
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:34,867
It's very unsinly,

456
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,541
making deals with devils.

457
00:30:38,396 --> 00:30:41,189
How do I know this
isn't just another trick?

458
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,736
It's no trick.

459
00:30:43,863 --> 00:30:45,933
I will give you the colt

460
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:47,283
and the bullet.

461
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,900
But you got to help Dean.

462
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:53,508
You got to bring him back.

463
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:56,990
Why, John, you're a sentimentalist.

464
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:00,552
If only your boys

465
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:02,370
knew how much their daddy loved them.

466
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:04,420
It's a good trade.

467
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:09,085
You care hell of a lot more
about this gun than you do Dean.

468
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:10,280
Don't be so sure.

469
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,321
He killed some people
very special to me.

470
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,659
But, still, you're right.
He isn't much of a threat.

471
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,689
And neither is your other son,

472
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,750
of course.

473
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:26,731
You know the truth,

474
00:31:26,732 --> 00:31:27,734
right?

475
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,622
About Sammy...

476
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:33,014
and the other children?

477
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:34,347
Yeah.

478
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:35,967
I've known for a while.

479
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:39,579
But Sam doesn't, does he?
You've been playing dumb.

480
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:41,978
Can you bring Dean back?

481
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:44,532
Yes or no.

482
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,687
No.

483
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:48,384
But I know someone who can.

484
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:50,733
It's not a problem.

485
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:52,422
Good.

486
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:55,029
And before I give you the gun,

487
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,883
I'm gonna want to make
sure that Dean's okay,

488
00:31:57,884 --> 00:31:59,446
with my own eyes.

489
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:01,259
Oh, John, I'm offended.

490
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,721
Don't you trust me?

491
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,228
Fine.

492
00:32:09,735 --> 00:32:13,027
- So we have A deal?
- No, John, not yet.

493
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:15,921
You still need to sweeten the pot.

494
00:32:15,922 --> 00:32:17,194
With what?

495
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:22,520
There's something else I want

496
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:23,927
as much as that gun.

497
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,619
Maybe more.

498
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,677
It's time to put the pain behind you.

499
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:35,013
And go where?

500
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:37,363
Sorry.

501
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:40,450
I can't give away the big punch line.

502
00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:47,507
Moment of truth.

503
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:51,068
No changing your mind later.

504
00:32:54,063 --> 00:32:55,641
So, what's it going to be?

505
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,141
What are you doing that for?

506
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:19,175
I'm not doing it.

507
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:22,306
What the hell...!

508
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:23,937
You can't do this!

509
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,709
Get away!

510
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,242
What's happening?!

511
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:38,998
Today's your lucky day, kid.

512
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:43,630
Dean!

513
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:46,469
Help! I need help!

514
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:52,428
I can't explain it.

515
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:53,846
The edema has vanished.

516
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:56,122
The internal contusions are healed.

517
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:57,335
Your vitals are good.

518
00:33:58,374 --> 00:34:00,443
You got to have some kind
of angel watching over you.

519
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:02,138
Thanks, doc.

520
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:07,877
You said a reaper was after me?

521
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,040
Yeah.

522
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,257
How did I ditch it?

523
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:11,308
You got me.

524
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,526
Dean, you really don't
remember anything?

525
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:15,374
No.

526
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:17,448
Except this

527
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,863
pit in my stomach.

528
00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:21,638
Sam, something's wrong.

529
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:26,411
How you feeling, dude?

530
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,196
Fine, I guess.

531
00:34:29,093 --> 00:34:30,244
I'm alive.

532
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,295
That's what matters.

533
00:34:32,296 --> 00:34:33,538
Where were you last night?

534
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:38,271
I had some things to take care of.

535
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:39,716
Well, that's specific.

536
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,785
Come on, Sam.

537
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,089
Did you go after the demon?

538
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:46,882
No.

539
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,371
You know, why don't I
believe you right now?

540
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,161
Can we not fight?

541
00:34:58,736 --> 00:35:01,843
You know, half the time we're fighting,
I don't know what we're fighting about.

542
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:03,104
We're just butting heads.

543
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,829
Look, Sammy, I've...

544
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,590
I've made some mistakes.

545
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:12,656
But I've always done the best I could.

546
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:16,370
I just don't want to
fight anymore, okay?

547
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:19,887
Dad, are you all right?

548
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,238
Yeah.

549
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,948
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

550
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:29,126
Hey, son, would you mind, uh...

551
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,263
Would you mind getting
me a cup of caffeine?

552
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,341
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

553
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:56,359
What is it?

554
00:35:58,304 --> 00:35:59,554
You know, when, uh...

555
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:01,847
When you were a kid,

556
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:05,528
I'd come home from a hunt,

557
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:09,595
and after what I'd seen, I'd be...

558
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,119
I'd be wrecked.

559
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,516
And you...

560
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:17,251
You'd come up to me, and

561
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:20,281
you'd put your hand on my shoulder, and
you'd look me in the eye, and you'd...

562
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:27,289
You'd say, "it's okay, dad".

563
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,025
Dean.

564
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:36,593
I'm sorry.

565
00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:39,920
Why?

566
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:45,800
You shouldn't have had to say that to me.
I should've been saying that to you.

567
00:36:47,444 --> 00:36:49,031
You know, I put...

568
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:53,905
I put too much on your shoulders.
I made you grow up too fast.

569
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,067
You took care of Sammy.
You took care of me.

570
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:01,375
You did that.

571
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,955
And you didn't complain. Not once.

572
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:10,976
I just want you to know...

573
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:14,445
that I am so proud of you.

574
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,331
Is it really you talking?

575
00:37:19,332 --> 00:37:20,597
Yeah.

576
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:22,203
Yeah, it's really me.

577
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,965
Why are you saying this stuff?

578
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:36,668
I want you to watch out for Sammy, okay?

579
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:39,334
Yeah, dad, you know I will.

580
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:41,789
You're scaring me.

581
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:45,396
Don't be scared, Dean.

582
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:41,557
Okay.

583
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,077
Dad?

584
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:16,926
No, no, no, it's our dad. It's our dad!

585
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:21,185
Okay. Let's try again.
An amp of atropine.

586
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:22,027
Come on...

587
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:29,765
Okay. Stop compression.

588
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:38,916
- Come on, Come on.
- still No pulse.

589
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:42,522
Okay. That's it, everybody.
I'll call it.

590
00:39:43,907 --> 00:39:46,493
Time of death, 10:41 a.m.
