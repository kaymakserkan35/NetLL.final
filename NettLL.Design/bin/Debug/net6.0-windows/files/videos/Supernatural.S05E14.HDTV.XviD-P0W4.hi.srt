Alice never drank, never even swore.

She was a nice girl.

I've finished my pre-lims.

194
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:43,174
I pulled the organ sets and
sent off the tox samples.

195
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,143
Great. You mind if we
take a look at the bodies?

Not at all.

Check this out.

209
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:31,656

Oh, no.

I think it's Enochian.

You mean like angel scratches?

214
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:49,006
So you think it's like
the tagging on our ribs?

I'm gonna hang up now.

223
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:11,429
Right.

224
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:19,036
You're right, Sam. These 
are angelic marks.

225
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:21,005
I imagine you'll find similar marks

226

on the other couples' hearts as well.

227

So, what are they? I mean,
what do they mean?

228
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,878
It's a mark of union.

This man and woman 
were intended to mate.

230

Okay, but who put them there?

231
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:35,119
Well, your people call them "Cupid."

What human myth has 
mistaken for "Cupid",

234
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,994
is actually a lower order of angel.

235
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,496
Technically it's a Cherub, third-class.

So, what you're saying is...

243
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,544
What I'm saying is a 
Cupid has gone rogue,

244
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:03,180
and we have to stop him,
before he kills again.

245

00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:08,465
Pulled his records.

372
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:11,668
Looks like this gentleman used
to weigh 400 pounds or so,

373
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:13,470
till he got a gastric bypass,

374
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:16,039
which brought down 
his weight considerably.

375
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,708
But then for some reason, last night,

376
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,077
he decided to go 
on a Twinkie binge.

377
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,914
So, he died from a Twinkie binge?

378
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:28,518
Well, after he blew out the
band around his stomach,

379
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,754
he filled it up till it burst.

380
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:32,889
When he could no longer swallow,

381
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:35,558
he started jamming the 
cakes down his gullet

382
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:36,993
with a...

383
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:39,229
with a toilet brush,

384
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:43,600
like he was ramrod ding a cannon.

385
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:44,601
[ sighs ]

386
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:45,669
[ sighs ]

387
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:47,971
So, what do you make of it?

388
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,739
I'd say that it was

389
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,841
a very peculiar thing to do.

390
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:54,644
Hey.

391
00:17:54,712 --> 00:17:56,813
So, uh, this guy was 
not marked by Cupid,

392
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,882
but his death is definitely suspicious.

393
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:01,484
Yeah, well, I just went
through the police blotter,

394
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:02,652
and counting him,

395
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,454
that's eight suicides since Wednesday

396
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:05,789
and 19 O.D'S...

397
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:08,058
that's way out of the
seasonal batting average.

398
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,560
Yeah, if there's a pattern here,
it ain't just love.

399
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,662
It's a hell of a lot bigger than we thought.

400
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,364
Yeah, all right. I'll see you in 10.

401
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,932
Yep, okay.

00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:51,601
Aaah!

407
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,603
I could smell you.

408

got to do with this, anyway?

[ sighs ] Believe me, I got no idea.

415
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:39,315
You okay?

416
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:42,519
Yeah, yeah. I'll be all right.

417
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:47,524
Let's crack her open.

418
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:50,226
What's the worst that 
could happen, right?

419
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:02,539
Whoa!

420
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:09,446
What the hell was that?

421
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:11,047
Castiel: It's a human soul.

422
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,619
It's starting to make sense.

423
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:19,222
Now, what about that makes sense?

424
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,290
And when did you start eating?

425
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,491
Exactly.

426
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,560
My hunger... it's a clue, actually.

427
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:26,029
- For what? 
- For what?

428
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,363
This town isn't suffering

429
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:28,865
from some love-gone-wrong effect.

430
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:30,166
It's suffering from hunger.

431
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:32,535
Starvation, to be exact...

432
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:34,170
specifically...

433
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:35,171
famine.

434
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,006
Famine?

435
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:39,042
A-as in The Horseman?

436
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,143
Great.

437
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:41,945
Th-th-that's freaking great.

438
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:44,948
I thought famine meant starvation,

439
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:47,350
like as in, you know, food.

440
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,052
Yes. Absolutely.

441
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,920
But not just food.

442
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,022
I mean, everyone seems to
be starving for something...

443
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,228
sex, attention, drugs, love...

444
00:20:58,295 --> 00:20:59,462
Well, that explains

445
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,064
the puppy-lovers 
that Cupid shot up.

446
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:02,198
Right.

447
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,234
The Cherub made them crave love,

448
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:07,003
and then famine came,
and made them rabid for it.

449
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,671
Okay, but what about you?

450
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:10,340
I mean, since when do angels

451
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:11,975
secretly hunger for white castle?

452
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:17,547
It's my vessel... Jimmy.

His, uh, appetite for red meat

has been touched 
by famine's effect.

455
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:26,756
So, famine just rolls into town

456
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,091
and everybody goes crazy?

457
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:35,265
"And then will come famine
riding on a black steed."

[ labored ] Hungry.

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,807
Famine is hungry.

465
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:53,910
He must devour the 
souls of his victims.

466
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:56,813
So, that's what was in the briefcase,

468
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:05,688
Lucifer has sent his
demons to care for famine,

to feed him, make 
certain he'll be ready.

Where?

00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:45,194
At the hospital.

00:23:45,262 --> 00:23:48,197
We fought, but he got away.

Now, where is it?

I am sorry. No. The...

Uh, he had the knife.

So, what, this whole town

and screw itself to death?

501

You got to get him out of here.
