1
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:18,519
Bar-keep, I would like to purchase
some alcohol, please.

2
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:20,354
Uh-huh. What can I get you?

3
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:22,957
Well, I'm 26, as you can see.

4
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:24,959
From my license.

5
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,628
Congratulations. 
What can I get you?

6
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:30,231
A banana daiquiri, my good man.

7
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,368
I'm crystal.

8
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:36,037
What's your name?

9
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:37,772
- Hi, Crystal. 
- I'm Gary.

10
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:40,041
Gary, I don't want to embarrass you,

11
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:41,475
but you are just...

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,878
you are just a stunning-looking man.

13
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:45,746
I know, right?

14
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:51,586
Ooh! Thanks!

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,121
So, Gary, you having
a good time tonight?

16
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:56,624
Mm! Thank you 
for asking, Crystal.

17
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:59,160
This is, like, the best night ever.

18
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:03,497
Do you think we could
make it any better?

19
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,935
Probably. I don't know.

20
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:12,673
I mean, do you want to get out of here?

21
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:17,612
Well, I-I kind of like this bar.

22
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:20,414
And I just ordered this daiquiri.

23
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:23,284
I mean...

24
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:25,252
<i>Do you want to get out of here with
me?</i>

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,628
Are we talking about sex?

26
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,830
Well, I, uh...

27
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:40,701
Yeah. I suppose we are.

28
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:47,174
<i>Crystal, I would love to
have the sex with you.</i>

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,677
Great.

30
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,512
Then let's go.

31
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,487
Love that jacket on you, by the way.

32
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,488
Thanks.

33
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:03,324
Actually...

34
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:07,028
The whole outfit is new.

35
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:17,031
Season 5 Episode 12
   "Swap Meat"

36
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:25,045
Dean and Sammy Winchester.

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,281
So, how long has it been?

38
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:27,615
The summer before 6th grade.

39
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,117
Mm-hmm. I remember.

40
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:31,286
You assigned yourself
your own reading list.

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,255
that's right. I forgot about that.

42
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,126
Your mom happens to be the
best babysitter we ever had.

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,729
Well, when I was a
maid at the mayflower,

44
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:42,831
Out on the interstate --

45
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:45,100
Long before you were even an idea --

46
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:46,801
Their daddy used to pass through town

47
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:48,169
And leave the boys with me

48
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:51,673
While... He went off to... Work.

49
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:54,408
One time, he was gone for two weeks.

50
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:56,110
- Two weeks? 
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,613
Oh, he'd always come limping back.

52
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,548
He loved you boys.

53
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,418
Did you know what he did all that time?

54
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,854
Little Sammy kept trying to tell me.

55
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:08,923
Of course, I didn't believe him.

56
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:10,257
Not at first, anyway.

57
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:15,363
Katie, our dad, um...

58
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:17,098
Happened to be an expert
at getting rid of ghosts.

59
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:19,500
<i>And now, so are we.</i>

60
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,302
That's why I called them, sweetie.
They can help us.

61
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:25,306
Sounds like you guys got
yourself a poltergeist.

62
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,675
Started a month or two
after we moved in.

63
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,678
Yeah, first I-it was, uh,
just bumps and knocks

64
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,813
And, uh, scratches on the walls.

65
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,782
And then it started breaking things

66
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,217
And then it attacked Katie?

67
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,519
That was two nights ago.

68
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,988
Can you show them, honey?

69
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,995
"murdered Chylde."

70
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,902
Katie...

71
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:56,737
Everything's gonna be fine.

72
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,272
I promise.

73
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:01,242
Why don't you guys take
yourselves a little vacation,

74
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:03,577
And, uh, we'll take care of it.

75
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:05,713
thank you.

76
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,855
Uh, bacon burger turbo,
large chili-cheese fry,

77
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,459
Uh, and a health-quake salad shake?

78
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:21,028
I know. I know.

79
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:23,998
It's, uh it's not mine.

80
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,185
Oh, you shake it up, baby.

81
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,354
You know, poltergeist aside,

82
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,023
Donna looked pretty good,
don't you think?

83
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,191
Dude, don't tell me

84
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:52,359
You've still got the
hots for our babysitter.

85
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:53,561
What? No.

86
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,696
That's weird.

87
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:57,998
I'm just saying that she,
you know, she --

88
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,533
She's -- she's doing good.

89
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:02,369
You know, with her husband, her kid.

90
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,705
This whole amityville thing being
thrown at them, and they're hanging
tough.

91
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,973
Yeah.

92
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:11,145
You ever think that you'd
want something like that?

93
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,849
Wife, rugrats, the whole nine

94
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:18,486
No. I mean, not really my thing anymore.

95
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,655
Yeah.

96
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,759
What do you got?

97
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:27,495
Uh, well, that house of theirs,

98
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:29,163
<i>It's old -- really old.</i>

99
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:30,931
Um, hundreds of years.

100
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:33,134
And I found a legend.
It's unconfirmed, but still...

101
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:34,135
Saying?

102
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,636
Supposedly, in the 1720s,

103
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,471
House was owned by a guy
named Isaiah Pickett.

104
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:39,273
Legend has it

105
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:42,877
He hung a woman in his
backyard for witchcraft --

106
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,478
A woman named Maggie Briggs.

107
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:46,480
Okay, so an angry ghost witch?

108
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:47,915
If it's true.

109
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,751
That still doesn't explain
what "murdered Chylde" means.

110
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:52,953
No. Or where the bitch is buried.

111
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:55,356
You know, I mean, it's a long way back,

112
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,726
But I can see if I can find
something in the town records.

113
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,394
It's worth a shot.

114
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:06,534
Gary! Curly fries are up!

115
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:07,535
So, any luck?

116
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:08,903
Bubkes.

117
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:11,906
<i>Can't even find proof a woman named
Maggie Briggs existed,</i>

118
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,808
Much less where she was planted.

119
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:16,644
Okay. Well, we've got a
minute to breathe here.

120
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:18,546
Let's pick it up first thing.

121
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,781
You bet. See you in a few.

122
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,230
Aah!

123
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,232
What...

124
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:45,806
who...

125
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:25,980
Yeah, this is Collins out on route 30.

126
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:27,147
I think we got him.

127
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,052
Mr. Frankel?

128
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,888
Mr. Gary Frankel?

129
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:35,189
Who?

130
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,624
Your family's worried
sick about you, son

131
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:38,926
My -- my family?

132
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,328
My... Brother called you?

133
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:42,763
Come on. Get in before you freeze solid.

134
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,729
Thanks, uh...

135
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:18,666
But, uh, w-where are we?

136
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
You're home, son.

137
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:23,604
N-no, officer, I-I'm not staying here.

138
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:25,873
Gary! Oh, my god!

139
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,041
Gary! Oh, god! Gary!

140
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,409
Oh, hey!

141
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:29,777
Are you all right?

142
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,278
Oh! Okay. Okay. Okay.

143
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:32,413
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

144
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:35,215
Uh... W-what's going on here

145
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,750
What do you mean? Lady, who are you?

146
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:38,252
Young man, are you drunk?

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,021
<i>And who are you?</i>

148
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:42,923
Gary, are you drunk?

149
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,358
Answer your father.

150
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,226
My father?

151
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:49,863
Look, I --

152
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:57,972
Who is that?!

153
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:59,773
Who the hell is that?!

154
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:01,375
He's out of his gourd.

155
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,911
Young man, I'm very surprised at you.

156
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,512
Yeah.

157
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:07,114
Tell me about it.

158
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:16,834
oh, yeah.

159
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,971
Bring it!

160
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,845
Holy crap.

161
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:29,747
Sam.

162
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,315
Where the hell you been, man?

163
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:33,284
I've been trying to call you for hours.

164
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:36,120
I picked up some food.

165
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:39,924
Bacon burger turbo,
large chili-cheese fry, right?

166
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,163
Sorry, man. Really.

167
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,232
I-I just -- I lost track of time.

168
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,067
I didn't mean to freak you out.

169
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,169
Thanks.

170
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:55,573
Don't know why it took you
two hours, but thanks.

171
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,975
Oh, you're gonna want
to eat that on the road.

172
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:59,210
Why?

173
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:02,246
<i>The maid came in, saw that,</i>

174
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,449
And now they're all
kind of freaking out.

175
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:08,319
Why'd you let the maid in?

176
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:09,787
It just happened.

177
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:12,356
Whatever.

178
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,592
I got to hit the head,
and then we'll take off.

179
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:16,460
All right. I-I'll be outside.

180
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:46,924
Hey. You ready?

181
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,926
Absolutely.

182
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,796
Hey, can I drive?

183
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,375
Oh, this is so sweet!

184
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:11,048
You want to get the lead out,
Andretti? Come on.

185
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:15,753
Reverse.

186
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,321
Reverse!

187
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,930
It's in reverse.

188
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:30,434
I am really, really sorry.

189
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:34,438
Shut up.

190
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,715
<i>So, this is dean's other
other cell,</i>

191
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:46,750
So you must know what to do.

192
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:49,253
Dean, I've called every phone we got.

193
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:55,125
Where are you, man?

194
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,494
So...

195
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,463
This is gonna sound crazy --

196
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:02,633
<i>Realy crazy -- but, um...</i>

197
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,301
I think I'm in the wrong body.

198
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:06,804
could use a little help here.

199
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:14,211
I-I think I got asthma.

200
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:16,313
Call me back.

201
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:25,923
Lucky star motel.

202
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:29,093
Hello, uh, could you please
connect me to room 102?

203
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:31,128
102?

204
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:33,797
Nah, man, those guys checked
out middle of the night.

205
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:36,300
Wait -- "guys"? Plural?

206
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:39,269
Yeah -- one leather jacket,
one sasquatch.

207
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:40,604
They left.

208
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:00,224
<i>Who are you?</i>

209
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,173
Advanced placement.

210
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,480
Virgin.

211
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:35,058
<i>Frustrated virgin.</i>

212
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:52,376
Witchcraft, huh, Gary?

213
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,512
You little satanic bastard.

214
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:58,215
Gary! Breakfast

215
00:13:58,249 --> 00:13:59,650
Leave me alone.

216
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:02,986
Gary!

217
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:07,357
All right, I'm coming!

218
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:17,768
So, Gary, I'd like to know
what happened last night.

219
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:20,137
so would I. Believe me.

220
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:22,406
I mean, what happened
with the plan, buddy?

221
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,907
The plan?

222
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:26,243
S.A.T.S, m.I.T. -- The plan.

223
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:29,046
You want to be an engineer,
you need a full ride.

224
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,082
So, tell me, how does getting
drunk fit with the plan?

225
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:33,484
Right, yeah.

226
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:36,119
Listen, buddy, no offense,
but at the moment,

227
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,721
I could give a rat's
ass about your plan.

228
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:41,225
Excuse me?

229
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:46,163
Uh...

230
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:51,001
Listen, h-have I seemed,
uh, moody lately?

231
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:52,002
Withdrawn?

232
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:53,003
Wow.

233
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:55,739
Any -- any occult fixations?

234
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:56,773
What?

235
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:59,810
Let me guess -- I'm amazing at Latin.

236
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:01,078
You have an ear for languages.

237
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:02,346
Hmm.

238
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,381
Um, any of the neighborhood
pets go missing recently?

239
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:05,816
Are you smoking drugs?

240
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,386
Leonard. He is not smoking drugs.

241
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,622
Have any of you seen me w-w-with a book?

242
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:13,724
It'd be big and old, uh, leather-bound,

243
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:15,759
Maybe some strange writing on it.

244
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,762
Or frankly, I'm probably hiding it.

245
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,631
Gary, no!

246
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:21,632
W-what?

247
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,233
You're allergic to what gluten.

248
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:42,986
Gluten.

249
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:45,289
You've seriously sprung a leak. What?

250
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:47,591
If mom and dad ever found
that creepy old book of yours,

251
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,026
You'd be grounded for a decade.

252
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,527
And you're bringing it up at breakfast?

253
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:51,929
<i>So there is a book.</i>

254
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:55,198
Sydney, where do I keep it?

255
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,201
So, uh, where we going, anyway?

256
00:15:58,236 --> 00:15:59,836
To work.

257
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,138
The case?

258
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,041
Oh, right. Yeah -- the case. Of course.

259
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:05,676
Where, uh, do you want to start?

260
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,445
Well, since you couldn't find
where Maggie Briggs was buried,

261
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,480
Now we have to do an all-day tombstone roll

262
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:11,949
To see if we can dig her up.

263
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,784
Wait. M-Maggie Briggs?

264
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:15,786
<i>You mean, like -- like,
the witch Maggie Briggs?</i>

265
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Yeah, sherlock.

266
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:18,355
Yeah, she's in the basement.

267
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,726
Come again? W-what basement?

268
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,194
Isaiah Pickett's house.

269
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:27,564
Okay, there's this legend that
he hung her, but he didn't.

270
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,765
The real truth is

271
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,068
Is that she was carrying
his illegitimate child,

272
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:34,338
And he killed her and then
buried her in the basement.

273
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,673
Her "murdered Chylde."

274
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:38,675
That would explain the scratches.

275
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,843
How do you know all this?

276
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:42,012
Oh, I've done all kinds
of research on it.

277
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:45,882
I mean, you know... Last night.

278
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:47,985
Yeah.

279
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:51,989
Nice work... I guess.

280
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:59,396
Aw, man, turn it up!

281
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:01,898
Seriously?

282
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,834
Hell yeah!

283
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:23,387
Dean! Someone has stolen my body!

284
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,622
The guy right next to you is not me!

285
00:17:25,657 --> 00:17:29,159
Check your friggin' voicemail. Damn it.

286
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:31,528
Gary?

287
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:32,863
Are you okay?

288
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,498
Yeah, I'm Gary. Uh...

289
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,167
Gary's okay.

290
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:41,238
So we're referring to ourselves
in the third person now?

291
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:43,440
We heard about last night.
What happened?

292
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,375
Got drunk. No big thing.

293
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,443
Look, u, what's my locker number?

294
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:49,112
What? Are you -- are you still drunk?

295
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:51,181
Yeah. Yea. E, like,
three of you right now.

296
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:53,016
Um, so -- so, what's my locker number?

297
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:35,225
Oh, no, Gary.

298
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:40,564
This is a very, very bad book.

299
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:07,691
Boo-yah!

300
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:10,494
Master chief is in the house, bizatches!

301
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:11,995
Are you all right?

302
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:13,897
Yeah. Fine.

303
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:25,142
Well, I'll be damned.

304
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:28,078
Willow moss.

305
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,379
Yeah, right.

306
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:32,115
It's, uh, supposed to grow
over witches' graves, right?

307
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:38,622
Yeah.

308
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,026
Hey, man, I'm really sorry about this.

309
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,761
Sorry about what?

310
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:22,332
Sam?!

311
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,770
you okay?

312
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:28,271
Let's get the hell out of here!

313
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:30,974
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We still got
to burn the body, you idiot.

314
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:31,975
Come on.

315
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:01,838
Dude...

316
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:04,608
That was sweet!

317
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:16,872
Hey, Gary, wait up!

318
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:18,240
Where are you going?

319
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:19,541
I got something to do.

320
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:20,809
You're skipping class? You?

321
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:22,911
I'm just...

322
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:25,147
Not feeling like myself, okay?

323
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,982
Well, whatever it is,
we can talk it out, bro.

324
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,083
Come with us.

325
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:30,652
I don't have time.
I got to go. I'm sorry.

326
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:33,855
Hey!

327
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:39,294
Trevor!

328
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,463
Well, what else was I supposed to do?

329
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,975
Do me a favor, sweetheart.

330
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,179
Could you bring me a
cheeseburger with extra bacon?

331
00:21:57,213 --> 00:21:58,914
And fry an egg on top of it, would you?

332
00:21:58,948 --> 00:21:59,915
Absolutely.

333
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:02,284
Ooh, that -- that sounds good. Ditto.

334
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:04,486
Be right back with your order.

335
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,823
Okay, who are you and what
have you done with Sam?

336
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:10,091
W-what do you mean

337
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:15,463
Bacon cheeseburgers now?

338
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:17,499
I don't know. I eat them, don't I?

339
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:20,302
Anyways, we are celebrating.

340
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:22,270
Yeah, I guess.

341
00:22:22,305 --> 00:22:24,573
Another one bites the dust.

342
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:25,941
Nice work today.

343
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,609
You too.

344
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:30,145
I had a, uh, really awesome day, man.

345
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,213
Seriously.

346
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,654
Whoo!

347
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:40,722
Sweet.

348
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:42,991
A really awesome day?

349
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:44,292
Yeah. Why not?

350
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:45,994
It was a random, d-list ghost hunt.

351
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,896
That's... That's awesome to you?

352
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,332
I can't be in a good mood?

353
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:54,636
Yeah, I guess. It's...

354
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,338
No, actually.

355
00:22:56,372 --> 00:22:58,340
It's not really your style, Sam.

356
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,843
Well, then, it's a new me.

357
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:04,145
I mean, come on.
Why shouldn't I be happy?

358
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,148
I've got a gun, I'm getting drunk,

359
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:09,751
<i>And I look like this.</i>

360
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:13,922
I don't know.

361
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:17,792
You ever feel like your whole
future is being decided for you?

362
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:22,264
Uh, yeah, Sam, I feel like that a lot.

363
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:25,834
No matter how much you fight it,
you can't stop the plan.

364
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:27,702
The stupid, stupid plan.

365
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:29,571
So, I don't know.

366
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:31,573
I guess it's, uh, it's just nice

367
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:35,277
To do a little as
s-kicking for a change, that's all.

368
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:41,383
Uh, you know what? I -- I'm drunk.

369
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:44,286
sorry. Just -- just forget it.

370
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,787
No, no. It's all right.

371
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:47,188
It's, uh...

372
00:23:48,824 --> 00:23:50,125
I'll drink to that.

373
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:57,132
Wow, you know, is it just me,

374
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,100
Or are we actually drinking together?

375
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:02,103
We don't do it that often, huh?

376
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:04,873
yeah, you could say that.

377
00:24:04,907 --> 00:24:06,408
Well, we should.

378
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:08,109
You're a good guy, dean.

379
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,612
<i>Man, you are drunk.</i>

380
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:11,613
Here we go.

381
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:13,148
Mmm!

382
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:14,316
Thank you.

383
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,317
Enjoy.

384
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,218
No, but I mean it.

385
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:21,723
You really are a good guy.

386
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:27,228
Mmm!

387
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:31,566
The bread alone!

388
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,234
Mmm!

389
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:46,781
Love that jacket on you, by the way.

390
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:47,749
Thanks

391
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:50,618
Actually...

392
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:52,654
The whole outfit is new.

393
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:03,698
We're gonna do it!

394
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:27,322
Hey!

395
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:29,224
What the hell's going on?!

396
00:25:29,258 --> 00:25:31,259
You can scream all you want.

397
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:35,764
No one can hear you!
My parents are out of town!

398
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,265
Gary.

399
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:38,433
T. What up?

400
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:39,667
Where are you?

401
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:41,603
Uh, I can't really tell you right now,

402
00:25:41,637 --> 00:25:43,371
But, man, you wouldn't believe it.

403
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:46,641
Well... Well, where's dean?

404
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:49,177
Uh, the cloverleaf on route 6. Why?

405
00:25:49,211 --> 00:25:50,945
You mean you haven't killed him yet?

406
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,080
What?

407
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:54,115
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
W-what do you mean?

408
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,183
Kill dean?

409
00:25:55,217 --> 00:25:56,684
I'm... Building up to it.

410
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:58,019
Look, Gary, we got problems here.

411
00:25:58,054 --> 00:25:59,454
For one...

412
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:02,891
I'm looking at your body right now --

413
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:04,259
With this other dude in it.

414
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:05,560
What?

415
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:07,062
Yeah, he's been in your house.

416
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:08,229
He's hanging out with your parents.

417
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:10,298
Okay, just... Calm down.

418
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:13,401
Whatever he says,
no one's gonna believe him, right?

419
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:15,503
I mean, w-we're still good.

420
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:17,238
Just hurry up and kill the son
of a bitch already, would you?

421
00:26:17,273 --> 00:26:18,506
Don't rush me. I'll do it.

422
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,208
Yeah, you better.

423
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:24,245
Uh... Got to go.

424
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:31,519
<i>Oh, man. I am in way
over my head.</i>

425
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:34,789
I don't think he's gonna do it.

426
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:36,991
<i>Just relax. This is Gary
we're talking about.</i>

427
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:38,660
What the hell is going on here?

428
00:26:38,694 --> 00:26:40,061
How do you know who dean is?

429
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:41,796
Everybody knows dean.

430
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:43,832
He's "hell's most wanted."

431
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:46,101
Oh, no.

432
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:47,602
No.

433
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:49,771
Have you idiots been talking to demons?

434
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:51,005
<i>Oh, right. We're the idiots.</i>

435
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:53,875
You're just kids.

436
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:55,910
You have no idea what
you're messing with.

437
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:58,246
Well, we know that there's
a price on dean's head,

438
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,281
And we're the ones that
are gonna collect.

439
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:02,684
What's that supposed to mean?

440
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:05,854
About a month ago, we were down here --

441
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:06,955
Nora.

442
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:09,190
What? We're not allowed
to talk about him?

443
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:13,228
We were down here,
goofing around with that book.

444
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:16,231
Um, I wouldn't exactly call
praying to our dark overlord

445
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:17,765
"goofing around."

446
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,733
Don't be a loser, Trev.

447
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:19,968
Yeah, Trev.

448
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:23,271
Anyway, all of a sudden,
the lights flickered

449
00:27:23,305 --> 00:27:26,608
And Gary went into this weird trance.

450
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:30,011
He closed his eyes,
picked up a pencil, and drew this.

451
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:34,048
And you know what's really weird?

452
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,850
Gary can't draw.

453
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:38,853
He said he heard a voice in his head.

454
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:41,122
The demons were putting
out a bounty on this guy.

455
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:42,790
A bounty?

456
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:44,926
Yeah, to, like, every witch or satanist

457
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,561
Across the whole country.

458
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:50,532
But Gary -- Gary's the
one who spotted you.

459
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:52,700
And the "freaky Friday" crap?

460
00:27:52,735 --> 00:27:54,402
Another spell from the book.

461
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:57,539
Gary's idea -- go in Trojan horse-style.

462
00:27:57,573 --> 00:27:59,741
He's really smart.

463
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:01,876
That is, if he has the
beanbags to go through with it.

464
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:03,745
Listen to me.

465
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,648
You are making a terrible mistake.

466
00:28:06,682 --> 00:28:09,617
<i>We're talking about a
demon deal --</i>

467
00:28:09,652 --> 00:28:11,085
Killing somebody.

468
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,421
This isn't a game.

469
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:17,258
You're crossing a line
you won't come back from.

470
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:19,027
Believe me.

471
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:24,966
What?

472
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,468
Nothing. I-I...

473
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:31,172
Nora, don't tell me you're
actually listening to this jerk.

474
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:32,173
I don't know.

475
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,741
M-maybe.

476
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:35,243
I-I mean, what if he has a point?

477
00:28:35,277 --> 00:28:37,111
I don't believe this.
First Gary, now you.

478
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:38,913
I can't --

479
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:45,520
You know what?

480
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:46,854
Fine.

481
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:48,590
You want something done right...

482
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:49,757
What, you're gonna --

483
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,160
You're gonna go kill
dean yourself, tough guy?

484
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:53,494
Don't have to.

485
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:54,829
<i>I can do this.</i>

486
00:28:56,498 --> 00:28:58,766
N-no. Y-you can't be serious.

487
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,236
I'm calling up one of these bad boys,

488
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,204
Turning these punks over,
and getting paid.

489
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,939
Dollar, dollar bills, y'all!

490
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:07,008
I-I really don't think
that that's a good idea.

491
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:09,010
<i>It's not. It's a very,
very bad idea.</i>

492
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:10,945
No one asked you.

493
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,592
You're not Sam.

494
00:29:59,228 --> 00:30:00,495
Who the hell are you?

495
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,697
Ow!

496
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:05,066
Don't do this. I'm begging you.

497
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,968
Trevor, I think he's right.

498
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,737
Hey, you want to get
into Vassar, don't you?

499
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:11,506
Please! Stop!

500
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,573
Attrahendum eos...

501
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:14,542
You're gonna get us all killed!

502
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:16,411
...Ad ligandum eos pariter

503
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:19,347
Eos coram me!

504
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,654
Maybe I said it wrong.

505
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,290
Nora?

506
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:31,225
No! No, no! Don't touch her!

507
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,226
Nora, you okay?

508
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:36,798
Oh, yeah.

509
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:38,900
I'm peachy.

510
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:46,247
So, what'd you call me here for, skippy?

511
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:49,015
Unless...

512
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,718
it's dinnertime?

513
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:55,588
What? I-I -- n-no.

514
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:59,592
Uh, we have dean winchester.

515
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:01,428
You do?

516
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:03,096
Where?

517
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,965
Trevor, keep your mouth shut.

518
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,803
The cloverleaf motel over on route 6.

519
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:13,339
Sam?

520
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:17,210
<i>Is that you in there?</i>

521
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:26,152
Well, aren't you just
98 pounds o nothing.

522
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,355
The kid is a moron.

523
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,392
He doesn't have any idea where dean is.

524
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:37,864
So, if Sam's in this body,

525
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:40,233
Who's in Sam's?

526
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:43,436
A dangerous warlock.

527
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,408
Named Gary.

528
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,578
You mean to tell me
you've got dean winchester

529
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:54,848
<i>And Sam winchester's meat suit?</i>

530
00:31:56,617 --> 00:32:00,920
An empty vessel just
waiting to be filled.

531
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:03,590
And you're handing them both over to me?

532
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:06,259
Uh, y-yeah. I guess.

533
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:09,596
Well...

534
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,598
I got to hand it to you.

535
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,767
I'm impressed.

536
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:17,337
Thanks.

537
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:18,404
Um...

538
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:22,642
So, if you don't mind my asking...

539
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:24,978
There's a reward?

540
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:26,513
Sure.

541
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:32,986
My... Undying gratitude

542
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:37,690
What, are you serious?

543
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:38,992
Be quiet, you idiot!

544
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:40,994
Consider yourself lucky, kid.

545
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,933
uh, w-wait minute!

546
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,968
We worked our asses off here,

547
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:51,638
And, uh, I want my reward!

548
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:03,650
Please

549
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:06,653
Okay.

550
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,289
I'm sorry.

551
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,824
You're right.

552
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,760
What can I get you?

553
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,330
Well, h-how about a million bucks?

554
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:20,033
Oh, for god's sake, Trevor,
just shut up and run!

555
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,701
A million doesn't buy
you much these days.

556
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:23,169
Why not make it 10?

557
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:24,537
Okay, $10 mill.

558
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:25,572
And I want...

559
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:30,543
...I want Mindy Schwartz
to fall in love with me.

560
00:33:31,712 --> 00:33:35,014
Love... Money.

561
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,683
sticking to the basics.

562
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:39,385
I can respect that.

563
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,021
But here's my counter.

564
00:33:58,339 --> 00:33:59,672
Yep.

565
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:01,975
Tastes like moron.

566
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,682
<i>You have 38 messages.</i>

567
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:12,285
<i>This is gonna sound crazy --</i>

568
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,854
<i>Really crazy -- but, um, I think I'm in
the wrong body.</i>

569
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:23,129
<i>Dean, the guy right next to you is not
me!</i>

570
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:28,134
<i>Dean, check your friggin' voicemail.
Damn it.</i>

571
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,073
All right, pal.

572
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:37,142
Either you start talking
or I start water boarding.

573
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,111
Oh, my god. Please, don't hurt me.

574
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:40,946
Please! I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry!

575
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,081
Okay. Hey, pull it together, champ.

576
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:45,450
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

577
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:46,752
Where's Sam?

578
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:49,221
In my -- my friend's basement.

579
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,722
His parents are out of town.

580
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:51,723
Parents?

581
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,225
How old are you?

582
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,060
17.

583
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,328
17?

584
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:05,871
Nora

585
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,542
Not at the moment.

586
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,552
Whew!

587
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:32,264
Damn it!

588
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:40,338
Boy, you earned your
dessert tonight, kiddo.

589
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:44,342
Tell me -- what is it you want?

590
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:45,744
Anything.

591
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:47,279
Anything?

592
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,950
Lay it on me.

593
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,985
I want to be a witch.

594
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,054
For real.

595
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:57,789
And really powerful.

596
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,024
Mm. Good choice.

597
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:01,460
I get it.

598
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:05,530
No daddy, no m.I.T.

599
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:07,699
No plan.

600
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:10,368
You get to be big and strong,

601
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,904
And no one can tell you
what to do anymore.

602
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,744
There's just one small formality first.

603
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,748
You got to meet the boss.

604
00:36:22,815 --> 00:36:24,316
The boss?

605
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,385
You know -- your satanic majesty,

606
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,755
Or whatever the kids are
calling it these days.

607
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,324
The devil?

608
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,425
Mm-hmm.

609
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,595
Uh... No.

610
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,063
O-okay.

611
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:39,064
Um...

612
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:40,398
It's okay.

613
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:42,768
I... Don't really want to bother him.

614
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:45,604
<i>Oh, but he's gonna want
to meet you.</i>

615
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,372
Relax.

616
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,274
It'll be easy.

617
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:52,277
He's just gonna ask you
one little question,

618
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,679
And all you got to do is say "yes."

619
00:36:55,948 --> 00:37:05,357
And then... You get you reward.

620
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:16,068
Exorcizamus te, omnimundus.

621
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,237
What was that?

622
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:20,273
Uh, n-nothing.

623
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,942
Were you trying to exorcise me?!

624
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:25,077
You little piece of crap?!

625
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:32,385
spiritus, omnis satanica potestas.

626
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:39,559
Omnis incursio infernalis adversii.

627
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:41,427
Omnis congregatio.

628
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:44,096
Et secta diabolica.

629
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,432
Ergo, draco maledicte.

630
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:50,970
Ecclesiam tuam securi tibi
facias libertate servire.

631
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:52,138
Te rogamus.

632
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,472
Adios, bitch!

633
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:55,908
Uh, it's "audi nos."

634
00:37:56,977 --> 00:38:01,914
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

635
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,719
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

636
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,428
Animae domum redeant.

637
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:22,499
Fas atque nefas instauretur.

638
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:28,305
Potestate et auctoritate, sic fiat.

639
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,722
So, we good?

640
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,858
Yeah. We're good.

641
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,193
Oh, man, it's nice to be back.

642
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,496
Yeah. Awesome.

643
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,865
So...

644
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,900
gary...

645
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,236
Yeah. I know -- my bad.

646
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,838
"my bad"?

647
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,209
Kid, "my bad" ain't gonna cut it.

648
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,713
See, if you were of voting age...

649
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,214
You'd be dead.

650
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,150
Because we would kill you.

651
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,720
So either you straighten
up and fly right

652
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,155
Or wwill kill you.

653
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,691
Are we clear?

654
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:22,993
Crystal.

655
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,594
Good.

656
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,776
Crap.

657
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,279
Gary, look.

658
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,881
Take it from someone who knows --

659
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,616
Chin up, man.

660
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,118
Your life ain't that ad.

661
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,986
Uh, you met my parents.

662
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,788
<i>Yeah. So what? It's your life.</i>

663
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,624
You don't like their plan for you,
tell them to cram it.

664
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,693
Rebel a little it.

665
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,297
In a healthy,
non-satanic way, of course.

666
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,806
By the way, you know why
Nora's into witchcraft?

667
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,141
What do you mean?

668
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:14,277
<i>She doesn't like Satan, you moron.
She likes you.</i>

669
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,146
Really?

670
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,181
You -- you think?

671
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,216
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

672
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,284
I'm telling you, kid --

673
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,986
I wish I had your life.

674
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,088
You do?

675
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,389
Thanks.

676
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,793
Get out of here.

677
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,137
That was a nice thing to say.

678
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,875
I totally lied.

679
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,210
That kid's life sucked ass.

680
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:52,816
[sighs

681
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,392
All that apple-pie,
family crap? It's stressful.

682
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,895
Trust me -- we didn't miss a damn thing.

683
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,631
Or we don't know what we're missing.

684
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,771
Hey, come on, man. Turn it down.

685
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,076
Welcome back, kotter.
