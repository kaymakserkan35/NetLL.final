<b>Underworld Evolution - 
Action 2006 [H264-mp4] English</b>

2
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,808
My God. Brother, what have you done?

3
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:52,578
Yet again we arrive to witness
this monster's aftermath.

4
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,748
I will not tolerate this
any longer, Marcus.

5
00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:00,166
Your brother must be stopped.

6
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:02,420
It ends tonight.

7
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:06,090
We must move quickly, before they turn.

8
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,844
Is he still here?

9
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,928
Yes.

10
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:15,930
Viktor, he must not be harmed.

11
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,268
I gave you my word, did I not?

12
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:21,355
But William must be controlled.

13
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:25,950
Burn the bodies.

14
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:28,025
Search the outbuildings.

15
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,400
Form two groups. You,
douse them with fuel...

16
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:31,862
Marcus.

17
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,700
Stay with me.

18
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,028
Give me the torch.

19
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,658
They're turning!

20
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,825
They're turning!

21
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,252
Retreat to the woods.

22
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:05,462
I'll stay and fight. You need my help.

23
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,170
I need you alive.

24
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,572
If you die, we all die.

25
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,108
Now, go.

26
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:12,050
Go!

27
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:37,760
We found him.

28
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:38,676
And?

29
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,040
We need more men.

30
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:42,320
Find Amelia.

31
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:52,820
Amelia, we found William.

32
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,820
Surround him!

33
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,702
Take him down.

34
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:35,375
No.

35
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,172
Leave him be.

36
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:44,302
Stop this, you're killing him.

37
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,846
More!

38
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:14,745
William.

39
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:16,205
Marcus!

40
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,585
He was not to be harmed.

41
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,838
Place him in my charge as we agreed

42
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,254
or you will pay for your deceit.

43
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,132
And you will learn your place.

44
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,302
Your sympathy for this beast is foolish.

45
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,262
Your brother is entirely beyond control.

46
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:35,114
It will be done my way.

47
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:40,100
You know well the consequences
if you murder me or William.

48
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,872
If you so much as speak his name again

49
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,566
you will have chosen that future for him.

50
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:58,785
What is thy will, my lord?

51
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,998
Imprisonment for all time.

52
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:06,460
Far from you.

53
00:08:16,092 --> 00:08:20,550
For six centuries I was a loyal
soldier of the Vampire clan.

54
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:24,725
But I was betrayed.

55
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:29,272
The war was not as it had seemed.

56
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,418
In one night,

57
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,980
the lies that had united
our kind had been exposed.

58
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:37,278
Kraven, our second-in-command

59
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:39,948
had formed a secret alliance with Lucian

60
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:42,158
ruler of the Werewolf clan

61
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,970
to overthrow Viktor, our leader.

62
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,875
But Kraven's lust for power
and domination had failed.

63
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,078
Viktor was not the saviour
I had been led to believe.

64
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:59,508
He had betrayed us all.

65
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:09,642
Soon the hunt will be on for his killer.

66
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:15,800
I have but one ally left.

67
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,690
Michael

68
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,526
the human descendant of Corvinus.

69
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,480
Neither Vampire nor Lycan

70
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,885
but a hybrid.

71
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:31,120
It's only a matter of
time before we're found.

72
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:43,518
Underworld: Evolution.

73
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,726
My only hope now is to awaken Marcus

74
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:59,312
our last remaining elder

75
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,188
and expose the truth

76
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:05,818
before Kraven tries to murder him
while he's still in hibernation.

77
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:11,030
Kraven knows he's no match for him awake.

78
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,068
Perfect.

79
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,515
This thing's been dead for weeks.

80
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,395
I thought Lycans went back to
their human form when they die.

81
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:29,550
They do.

82
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:31,310
This one's been given a
serum to stop regression

83
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:33,106
so it can be studied.

84
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:34,482
How can you tell?

85
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,266
Not quite your department, I guess.

86
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:45,720
I just killed them.

87
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:47,526
I didn't pay much attention
to their anatomy.

88
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:50,370
How long can we stay here?

89
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:51,374
Not long.

90
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,916
These safe houses are all linked
together on one mainframe

91
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:56,712
with motion sensors revealing
which ones are active.

92
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,255
Someone could have picked us up already.

93
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,472
There's only about an hour till daylight.

94
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:12,076
Can you even make it back to
the mansion before sunrise?

95
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,270
Just.

96
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,160
Okay, let's get what we need and go.

97
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,165
No.

98
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,274
I'm going alone.

99
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:41,252
Open it.

100
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,889
Marcus?

101
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,938
The blood memories of
this wretched creature,

102
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,234
have shown me that your
treachery knows no bounds.

103
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,072
My lord, I can explain.

104
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:46,784
Why would I listen to your lies

105
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,910
when the journey to the truth

106
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:56,374
is so much sweeter?

107
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:05,410
I kept his secrets,

108
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:07,115
cleaned up the mess.

109
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,262
You'll go before Viktor

110
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:11,806
and tell him exactly what I tell you to!

111
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:15,558
You just concentrate on your part.

112
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,194
Please.

113
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,322
I can assist you.

114
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,680
Oh, you already have.

115
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,756
If I can plead my case,

116
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:43,030
there's a chance you'll
be granted sanctuary.

117
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,885
Right now, you'll be killed on sight.

118
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,050
I'm not prepared to risk it.

119
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:47,926
So what am I supposed to
do, sit and wait for you?

120
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,364
No, Kraven may still have his men with him.

121
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:51,000
You're not going alone.

122
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:52,758
You're not as strong as you might think.

123
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,025
What?

124
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,880
Michael, you're unique.

125
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,889
There's never been a hybrid before.

126
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,545
However ambivalent you might feel about it,

127
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,680
the truth is your powers
could be limitless.

128
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,458
But you depend on blood.

129
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,095
You need to feed.

130
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,205
Without it, you'll be growing weaker,

131
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,620
by the second. Use the time for that.

132
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Jesus Christ.

133
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,112
And what if I don't?

134
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:15,822
What if I can't?

135
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:17,908
Normal food could be lethal.

136
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:20,910
If you don't anticipate your
cravings, you will attack humans.

137
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,248
And believe me, you don't
want that on your conscience.

138
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,975
There really is no going back, Michael.

139
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,170
I'm sorry.

140
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:33,796
Look, I understand what you did.

141
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,756
I'm grateful.

142
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:38,926
You saved my life.

143
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:41,552
I wasn't ready to die.

144
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,394
I don't know.

145
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:49,210
Every thing's changed.

146
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:51,238
I probably need just a minute
to make it all fit in my head.

147
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:55,248
It's a lot to process all at once.

148
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:57,468
Look, go.

149
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,400
I'll be here.

150
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,864
You just make sure you come back.

151
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,402
Sir.

152
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,030
The innocent who witnessed...

153
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:32,530
they've been silenced?

154
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,284
But otherwise unharmed, as ordered.

155
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,902
Show me what you have.

156
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:42,406
Yes, sir.

157
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,008
Two Death Dealers were killed.

158
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:51,148
We found no Lycan bodies.

159
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,265
Apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition,

160
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,800
some sort of UV round.

161
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,095
Amelia?

162
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,098
No one survived.

163
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,684
It seems Kraven's men
might have been present,

164
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,688
but they did nothing to prevent it.

165
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,730
And Viktor?

166
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,252
And no trace of Marcus amongst the ashes?

167
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:36,172
It seems he destroyed his own coven, sir.

168
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,050
It was never his coven.

169
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,098
We need to go.

170
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:51,282
Give me a moment.

171
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:11,534
There you are.

172
00:24:13,842 --> 00:24:15,384
How you doing?

173
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:38,322

Viktor put you here for a reason,

314

but I doubt it was because
you had moral qualms.

and others on deception.

322
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:07,570
Viktor was not the first of our

323

when the next breath meant more
to Viktor than silver or gold,

332
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:38,690
Marcus came

333
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:40,140
with an offer,

334
00:52:40,144 --> 00:52:44,280
a reprieve from sickness and death.

335
00:52:44,785 --> 00:52:46,785
Immortality.

336
00:52:46,895 --> 00:52:50,604
And in return, Viktor was to use his
army-turned-immortal to help him.

337
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:52,900
To do what?

338
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:55,402
To defeat the very first Werewolves,

339
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,500
a dangerous and infectious breed

340
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,720
created by Marcus' own flesh and blood.

341
00:53:03,254 --> 00:53:04,895
His twin brother, William.

342
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,730
But these weren't the Lycans we know.

343
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,949
Disgusting though your brethren may be,

344
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:13,118
they at least are evolved.

345
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:15,578
No, these were raging monsters.

346
00:53:15,786 --> 00:53:19,080
Never able to take human form again.

347
00:53:19,288 --> 00:53:22,415
It was only later generations that
learned to channel their rage.

348
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:26,335
And William's appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable.

349
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:29,245
He had to be stopped.

350
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:31,672
And so once Viktor's army was turned,

351
00:53:31,882 --> 00:53:34,258
the legions of Vampires under his control

352
00:53:34,468 --> 00:53:37,678
tracked down and destroyed the animals,

353
00:53:37,886 --> 00:53:39,678
then captured William

354
00:53:39,805 --> 00:53:41,766
and locked him away.

355
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:44,432
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

356
00:53:46,642 --> 00:53:48,052
Why let him live?

357
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:51,260
For the very same reason that Viktor
never conspired against Marcus.

358
00:53:51,332 --> 00:53:52,632
Fear.

359
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:54,932
He was warned that, should
Marcus ever be killed,

360
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:58,235
all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

361
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,278
So in Viktor's mind,

362
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,198
William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans,

363
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:06,406
his slaves.

364
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:08,992
Yes.

365
00:54:10,245 --> 00:54:12,330
Yes, a clever deception,

366
00:54:12,538 --> 00:54:15,270
but one Viktor was hardly
willing to put to the test.

367
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,626
And so Marcus was protected

368
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:21,044
at all costs.

369
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,450
Ah, yes, here we are.

00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,942
The father of us all.

374
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,085
What's this?

375
00:54:54,362 --> 00:54:55,945
You should know.

376
00:54:57,198 --> 00:54:59,248
It's William's prison.

377
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,912
The prison your father was
commissioned to build.

378
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,585
So you've been the one keeping a
watch over this for me, have you?

379
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:16,044
I've been searching everywhere
for this, my darling.

380
00:55:21,248 --> 00:55:22,858
What is it?

381
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,180
What's wrong?

382
00:55:25,386 --> 00:55:28,220
She now understands why
her family was killed.

383
00:55:31,182 --> 00:55:33,558
But that was many years later.

384
00:55:34,892 --> 00:55:36,728
The winter of Lucian's escape.

385
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:38,938
Your father knew too much.

386
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:41,396
Or too much for Viktor to risk,

387
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,190
especially when Lucian

388
00:55:44,192 --> 00:55:47,485
had the key to William's cell.

389
00:55:48,528 --> 00:55:50,365
And I'm the map.

390
00:55:51,236 --> 00:55:52,736
Yes.

391
00:55:53,782 --> 00:55:58,285
The only one still living
who has seen its location.

392
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:01,590
Oh, Viktor realized you'd be too
young to remember explicitly,

393
00:56:01,594 --> 00:56:05,458
but Marcus knows that the memory,

394
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:09,294
and therefore the exact
location of William's prison

395
00:56:09,795 --> 00:56:11,830
is hidden away in your blood.

396
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:15,140
Why is Marcus looking for him now

397
00:56:15,564 --> 00:56:17,500
after all this time?

398
00:56:17,905 --> 00:56:19,905
That I cannot answer.

399
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:32,780
But I do know someone who could stop him.

400
00:56:32,788 --> 00:56:34,788
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

401
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:40,726
In exchange for your discretion, of course.

402
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,278
Of course.

403
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,140
Tanis.

404
00:57:40,262 --> 00:57:41,980
You seem anxious.

405
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,242
Why do you flee the very sight of me?

406
00:57:49,705 --> 00:57:50,872
Please...

407
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:53,456
sit.

408
00:57:54,832 --> 00:57:57,584
There's no need for this to be unpleasant.

409
00:57:58,795 --> 00:58:01,254
I've always rather enjoyed your company.

410
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:09,344
Now you're being rude.

411
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:12,438
Sorry.

412
00:58:20,312 --> 00:58:22,437
Viktor struck two keys.

413
00:58:23,022 --> 00:58:24,398
What do you know of them?

414
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:28,068
Keys?

415
00:58:29,026 --> 00:58:31,944
I don't know of any keys.

416
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,416
Oh, yes.

417
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,320
Yes, those keys.

418
00:58:51,502 --> 00:58:53,520
Yes.

419
00:58:53,528 --> 00:58:56,000
Well, one was...

420
00:58:56,005 --> 00:58:58,756
One was kept in plain sight,

421
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:01,175
draped around his daughter's neck,

422
00:59:01,926 --> 00:59:03,420
right there for you to see.

423
00:59:03,426 --> 00:59:05,426
And the other?

424
00:59:07,098 --> 00:59:08,750
Kept with Viktor at all times.

425
00:59:08,755 --> 00:59:10,855
Where?

426
00:59:11,142 --> 00:59:12,850
Within him.

427
00:59:14,432 --> 00:59:16,432
Beneath the flesh.

428
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:27,614
Please. Please. I beg you. Please.

429
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:46,690
Who could stop him. Perhaps
I could arrange a meeting.

430
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,170
Go to pier 17.

431
00:59:48,174 --> 00:59:50,174
Ask for Lorenz Macaro.

432
01:00:14,016 --> 01:00:16,168
How do we know Tanis isn't setting us up?

433
01:00:16,276 --> 01:00:18,695
He's not brave enough to set me up.

434
01:00:44,505 --> 01:00:45,838
You can go.

435
01:00:56,306 --> 01:00:58,374
You're familiar with this, then?

436
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:08,134
Intimately.

437
01:01:14,485 --> 01:01:16,362
You're Alexander Corvinus.

438
01:01:21,655 --> 01:01:25,995
There was a time that I
was known by that name.

439
01:01:27,414 --> 01:01:30,950
By any name, I am still your forefather.

440
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,175
How have you stayed hidden all these years?

441
01:01:40,382 --> 01:01:42,758
For centuries I've stood
by and watched the havoc

442
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,928
my sons have wrought upon each other

443
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
and upon humanity.

444
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,170
Not the legacy I prayed for

445
01:01:51,182 --> 01:01:53,635
the morning I watched
them enter this world.

446
01:01:54,926 --> 01:01:57,200
And a tiresome duty

447
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:00,275
keeping the war contained,
cleaning up the mess,

448
01:02:01,315 --> 01:02:04,608
hiding my family's unfortunate history.

449
01:02:04,818 --> 01:02:06,320
Couldn't you have stopped it?

450
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,330
Yes.

451
01:02:08,602 --> 01:02:10,650
Could you kill your own sons?

452
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:13,088
You know what Marcus will do.

453
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:16,245
If he finds me, he finds William's prison.

454
01:02:16,908 --> 01:02:18,908
You need to help us stop him.

455
01:02:19,912 --> 01:02:23,748
You are asking me to help you kill my son.

456
01:02:23,956 --> 01:02:25,332
You?

457
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,000
A Death Dealer?

458
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:30,615
How many innocents did you
kill in the six-century

459
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,330
quest to avenge your family?

460
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:35,275
Spare me your self-righteous declarations.

461
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:37,095
You are no different from Marcus

462
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,030
and even less noble than William.

463
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,845
At least he cannot control his savagery.

464
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:46,140
Anything I've done can
be laid at your feet.

465
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,345
Hundreds of thousands have died because of

466
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:49,665
your inability to accept that

467
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,345
your sons are monsters.

468
01:02:51,755 --> 01:02:53,660
That they create monsters.

469
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:55,410
You could've stopped all of this.

470
01:02:55,415 --> 01:02:57,800
Do not come grovelling to me simply

471
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:00,778
because you are weaker than your adversary.

472
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,524
You know the devastation William caused

473
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:04,225
before he was captured.

474
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,230
He cannot be set free.

475
01:03:54,152 --> 01:03:55,905
No, wait.

476
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,910
You're no match for him.

477
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:21,938
Soon, brother.

478
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,156
No.

479
01:05:09,082 --> 01:05:10,542
Father.

480
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,044
No.

481
01:05:13,504 --> 01:05:16,410
They've gone. There, my child.

482
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:18,114
You are safe now.

483
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:08,656
No. Michael.

484
01:06:09,784 --> 01:06:11,784
Look at me.

485
01:06:13,452 --> 01:06:15,452
Michael.

486
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,630
Shit.

487
01:06:42,764 --> 01:06:44,072
Please.

488
01:06:46,025 --> 01:06:48,042
Please.

489
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:58,292
Come on.

490
01:06:58,834 --> 01:07:00,502
Come on.

491
01:07:04,398 --> 01:07:06,398
Fuck.

492
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:54,550
Hello, Father.

493
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,410
You are unwelcome in my presence.

494
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,200
Ah.

495
01:08:00,448 --> 01:08:03,968
The predictable heart that never thaws.

496
01:08:04,888 --> 01:08:07,888
Pity it beats within such a fool.

497
01:08:08,888 --> 01:08:11,088
The eldest of the immortals,

498
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:15,060
yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

499
01:08:15,268 --> 01:08:20,605
We are oddities of nature, you and I.
Nothing more.

500
01:08:21,114 --> 01:08:23,356
This is a world for humanity.

501
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:27,994
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

502
01:08:28,102 --> 01:08:30,562
Why you stood by for over half a millennium

503
01:08:30,572 --> 01:08:34,074
as William suffered alone in darkness?

504
01:08:34,795 --> 01:08:36,795
No, Father.

505
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:40,820
I have no respect for your petty sentiment.

506
01:08:42,735 --> 01:08:44,535
Viktor's key.

507
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,990
Where is it?

508
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,600
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

509
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,096
You cannot control your brother.

510
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,240
Oh, I am stronger now.

511
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,320
And our bond is

512
01:08:53,324 --> 01:08:55,420
greater than you have ever
wanted to acknowledge.

513
01:08:55,424 --> 01:08:56,715
You're wrong.

514
01:08:56,925 --> 01:09:00,335
Soon you'll be drowning in
Lycans, just like before.

515
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,970
Oh, not Lycans, Father...

516
01:09:02,588 --> 01:09:04,780
or Vampires.

517
01:09:04,785 --> 01:09:06,590
A new race,

518
01:09:06,594 --> 01:09:08,865
created in the image of their maker

519
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,485
their new god.

520
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:16,888
Me.

521
01:09:28,974 --> 01:09:31,034
And a true god

522
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:37,522
has no father.

523
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,510
You will fail.

524
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:52,138
Get the kit.

525
01:10:52,142 --> 01:10:54,142
No.

526
01:11:00,462 --> 01:11:02,198
Please, sir,

527
01:11:02,202 --> 01:11:04,202
let us help you.

528
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:06,514
The time has come, my friend.

529
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:09,442
Find the girl.

530
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,944
Bring her to me.

531
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,448
No, wait. Wait.

532
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:26,638
If you want Marcus, you'll
need Alexander's help.

533
01:11:32,836 --> 01:11:34,336
Don't leave him here.

534
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,155
Did he get the pendant?

535
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,260
Yes.

536
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,308
He's too powerful for you alone.

537
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,735
You are the only one older than he is,

538
01:12:04,942 --> 01:12:06,902
the only one stronger.

539
01:12:07,112 --> 01:12:09,488
You could have killed him yourself.

540
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:13,658
No matter what he's become...

541
01:12:15,118 --> 01:12:17,118
he is my son.

542
01:12:23,032 --> 01:12:25,584
You are the last hope left.

543
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,836
There is only one way to defeat him.

544
01:12:37,376 --> 01:12:39,376
Quickly, now,

545
01:12:39,386 --> 01:12:43,588
before there is no more
legacy left in my veins.

546
01:12:52,096 --> 01:12:54,096
What will I become?

547
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,525
The future.

548
01:13:40,425 --> 01:13:42,425
Go now.

549
01:17:29,758 --> 01:17:31,758
We're getting close.

550
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,922
Head back around towards the river.

551
01:18:40,772 --> 01:18:42,856
I don't see a way inside.

552
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,360
There used to be a river
entrance just there.

553
01:18:47,568 --> 01:18:49,612
It must be submerged now.

554
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:52,020
Looks like we're getting wet.

555
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,342
Closer.

556
01:19:35,014 --> 01:19:37,014
Selene.

557
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:51,978
William.

558
01:21:06,582 --> 01:21:08,582
Wait.

559
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:15,150
No, William. Stop.

560
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,220
Be still, brother.

561
01:21:17,225 --> 01:21:19,225
It's me.

562
01:21:22,054 --> 01:21:24,722
I'd no sooner harm you than myself.

563
01:21:57,406 --> 01:21:59,406
Which way?

564
01:22:26,554 --> 01:22:28,554
Is this it?

565
01:22:32,682 --> 01:22:34,682
He's already here.

566
01:23:08,376 --> 01:23:10,090
What is that?

567
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:12,095
Nothing.

568
01:23:12,342 --> 01:23:14,342
Let's go.

569
01:23:24,598 --> 01:23:26,725
We're too late.

570
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,446
After him. Get behind him.

571
01:24:05,296 --> 01:24:07,296
Impressive.

572
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,850
Michael, you're unique.

573
01:25:19,852 --> 01:25:21,870
There's never been a hybrid before.

574
01:25:23,646 --> 01:25:25,646
Your powers could be limitless.

575
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:44,678
Hold it!

576
01:25:44,882 --> 01:25:46,882
Oh, fuck.

577
01:25:48,834 --> 01:25:50,768
Where is he?

578
01:25:50,774 --> 01:25:52,774
He went right through there.

579
01:25:53,395 --> 01:25:55,846
All we have are UV rounds.
They won't take him down.

580
01:25:56,256 --> 01:25:58,515
No, but they'll slow him down.

581
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,950
Let's go.

582
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:48,178
You all right?

583
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:06,780
Jesus Christ!

584
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,590
But these weren't the Lycans we know.

585
01:30:00,594 --> 01:30:02,030
No, these were raging monsters.

586
01:30:02,036 --> 01:30:04,162
Unable to take human form ever again.

587
01:30:54,918 --> 01:30:56,255
What are you waiting for?

588
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:57,190
Shoot them.

589
01:30:57,195 --> 01:30:59,375
I can't. Not without taking her out.

590
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,790
I can't get a shot.

591
01:31:52,838 --> 01:31:54,838
Michael.

592
01:32:30,366 --> 01:32:32,366
Take her down.

593
01:33:04,726 --> 01:33:06,726
Cut us loose!

594
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,480
We're going down!

595
01:34:50,725 --> 01:34:52,725
William!

596
01:35:02,816 --> 01:35:06,436
I knew Viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet.

597
01:35:07,436 --> 01:35:11,274
He should have killed you
with the rest of your family.

598
01:37:59,152 --> 01:38:01,695
An unknown chapter lies ahead.

599
01:38:02,205 --> 01:38:05,198
The lines that had divided the
clans have now been blurred.

600
01:38:05,706 --> 01:38:08,425
Chaos and infighting are inevitable.

601
01:38:08,835 --> 01:38:12,078
All that is certain is that
darkness is still ahead.

602
01:38:12,588 --> 01:38:14,318
But for now,

603
01:38:14,322 --> 01:38:16,322
for the first time

604
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:19,085
I look into the light with new hope...
