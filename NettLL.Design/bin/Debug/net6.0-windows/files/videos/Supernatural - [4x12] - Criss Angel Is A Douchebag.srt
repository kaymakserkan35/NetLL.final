1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,400
Tell me about those months
without your brother...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,600
About all the things you and
this demon bitch do in the dark.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,600
Do you even know how far off
the reservation you've gone?

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,100
How far from normal? From human?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,300
Why do you trust her so much?

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,900
She saved my life.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,700
You don't have the
juice to take me on, Sam.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,300
No, your abilities --
You're getting flabby.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,700
Yeah, so how do I tone up?

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,800
You know what you got to do.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
No, I'm not doing that anymore.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,600
- Sam...
- I said no.

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,000
Charlier cut.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,500
Wow. You're really good.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Yeah, great.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,100
Hey, show us another.

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,900
Finish your drink, Vance.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,600
This is a simple riffle shuffle.

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,700
Do a card trick for me.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,500
Ooh, here we go --
The incredible Jay.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,800
All right, young lady, would
you please tell me when to stop?

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,900
Stop.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,800
This is your card.
Commit it to memory. Hmm?

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
- That's incredible, Jay.
- Don't be a jerk.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
Right, now...

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,000
Do you see your card?

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Um, no, I don't.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,400
No, the cards say "no."

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,100
- Check his pocket.
- For god's sake, Vance.

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,600
Oh, just check --
Check the damn pocket!

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,600
So, if you then would remove...

34
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,000
Is this your card?

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,300
Why are you so mean? Can't you
just leave the old guy alone?

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,700
Is he wearing eyeliner?

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Can't tell. I'm blinded
by all the sterling silver.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
The light has to find me!

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Get it?! It --
It has to find me!

40
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,200
What a douche bag.

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,100
Would guys give it a rest?
You're giving me a headache.

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,900
Oh, come on, Jay. His misdirect is
shaking his ass like an 8th avenue hooker.

43
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,100
Used to be about skill.

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,700
Yeah, used to be. Used to be.

45
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,300
Listen to the you two. It's pathetic.

46
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,300
Bitter, old men talking
about the glory days.

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,100
You know what? This
douche bag isn't the joke.

48
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,100
We are.

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Hey, who you calling a joke?

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,700
Me, for one.

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,400
That used to be us.

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,700
You know, maybe he is a douche bag,
but he's playing the main stage,

53
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,100
And we can't even afford an assistant.

54
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,700
What the hell are we doing?

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,000
We're doing all right.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
No, we're not.

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,500
We're sad, we're old...

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,700
And we're dying.

59
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,500
Jay.

60
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm gonna do the table of death tonight.

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,600
No. No, you're not, Jay. Don't be crazy.

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,800
You almost killed yourself the last time
you tried it. And that was 30 years ago!

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, who cares if it kills me?

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,400
At least I'll go out with a headline.

65
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,900
What you are about to see is
not a trick or an illusion --

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,500
Simply a display of
daring and dexterity.

68
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,900
Now, young lady, if you'll
please check the bindings.

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,900
You'll see they're very real,

70
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
Very tight.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,500
Thank you. You may take your seat.

72
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Damn straight they're tight.

73
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,000
You sure you can slip them?

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,100
Show's in an hour, Vance.

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,900
Try to be on time.

76
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:50,100
Supernatural s04 ep12

77
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,800
This isn't a trick, okay?
I-I-I don't do tricks.

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
This is a demonstration

79
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,200
About demons and
angels, love and lust...

80
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,500
What a douche bag.

81
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
...all that stuff mixed up in my head.

82
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,200
That's Jeb Dexter.

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I don't even want to
know how you know that.

84
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,800
He's famous...kind of.

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
- ??
- For what,

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
- Douchebaggery?
- ...how messed up it gets,

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't touch me, okay?
For your own safety.

88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Go back to hell, demon!

89
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,100
Is this your card?

90
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,300
You got to be kidding me.
A fake demon possession?

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,000
I can't believe people
actually fall for that crap.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,300
It's not all crap.

93
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,500
What part of that was not
a steaming pile of b.S.?

94
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,600
Okay,that was crap, but
that's not all magicians.

95
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,800
It takes skill.

96
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,700
Oh, right. Right. I forgot.

97
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,400
You were actually into
this stuff, weren't you?

98
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,900
I mean, you had -- You had,
like, a deck of cards and a wand.

99
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,600
Dude, I was 13. It was a phase.

100
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,600
Just -- It bugs me.
Actually, it offends me.

101
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
You know, playing at demons and magic,

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,700
When the real thing
will kill you bloody.

103
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,800
Like a guy who drops dead of 10 stab
wounds without a single tear in his shirt?

104
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,500
That's what I'm talking about.

105
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,500
So, did your boss have any
enemies that you know of?

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,400
Vance had plenty of enemies.

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,700
How so?

108
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,400
He would steal from other
magicians... all the time.

109
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
What would he steal?

110
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,000
Stage effects,
closeup techniques --

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
Anything he could get his hands on.

112
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,100
Is that enough to get him killed?

113
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,500
These guys take this
stuff pretty seriously.

114
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
There you are.

115
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,500
Did you find anything
weird in Vance's stuff?

116
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,000
Well...weirder?

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,100
Matter of fact, I did.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
I'm guessing this
didn't belong to Vance.

119
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,800
He hated card tricks.
Never wanted them around,

120
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,300
Let alone in his precious cape.

121
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,700
You gonna tell me how you did it?

122
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Did what?

123
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,600
You know what.

124
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,500
The great ones never
give away the "how."

125
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Yesterday you were sad, old, and dying.

126
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
Today you're one of the great ones?

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
Come on. This is me you're talking to.

128
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
You didn't think I could do it.

129
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,100
No, Jay, I didn't.

130
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
You're my friend, my best friend.

131
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,900
I-I just didn't want
to see you get hurt.??

132
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,900
Charlie, you want to see something?

133
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,500
Look at this.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Not bad.

135
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,200
"Not bad"?

136
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,500
I've been working to pull an ace out of
the middle of the deck for years just one --

137
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,400
And now I can pull three.

138
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,200
Still missing the ace of hearts.

139
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,700
I want to do the executioner tonight.

140
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,600
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

141
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,300
It's just a rope slip.

142
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,600
Houdini wouldn't try the executioner.

143
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,900
Exactly.

144
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Think about it, Charlie.
If I can pull this off...

145
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,600
I think you're pushing your luck.

146
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,600
It wasn't luck.

147
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,200
It wasn't.

148
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,000
Here, stand over there.

149
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,300
Let's not end up
like this, Charlie --

150
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,100
A couple of old farts doing
birthdays and bar mitzvahs.

151
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,300
It beats dying.

152
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,300
Does it?

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
I would do anything
for you. You know that.

154
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,800
But I will not watch you die.

155
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,500
I'll miss that show.

156
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,100
No, you'll be there.

157
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
You're always there for me.

158
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
Check your pocket.

159
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
That's good, Jay.

160
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,400
That's pretty damn good.

161
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,300
I can do it, Charlie.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,500
I want to do it.

163
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,900
Please.

164
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,000
It's a lame gig.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm in a fleabag hotel doing
this man-Of-The-People crap,

166
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,600
And freakin' angel's in
vegas doing cirque du soleil!

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,000
That should have been mine.

168
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,100
All right, boys, get it in
gear. I don't got all day.

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,500
You vernon haskell?

170
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,100
Who's asking?

171
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,200
Federal agent ulrich.

172
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Looking into the death of patrick Vance.

173
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm Jeb Dexter. This is devil twist.

174
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,200
We're chilling at the
international magicians convention,

175
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Which is a dope chance to tip my hat
to the wicked cats who came before me.

176
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,500
Smokin'-Hot effect last night, jim.

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Jay.

178
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,400
My name is Jay.

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,900
Yeah, whatever. We can loop it later.

180
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,600
What a douche bag.

181
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
Couldn't agree more.

182
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,500
Is, uh...

183
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,100
This familiar to you?

184
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,500
Should it be?

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,300
Well, I heard that you used
tarot cards in your act.

186
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,900
My act?

187
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
That was a long time ago.

188
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I haven't touched a deck
in years, you know...

189
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,300
Do know someone that might use them now?

190
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,600
Well, there was a guy
down on bleecker street.

191
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,600
Oh, yeah. He -- He peddles
that kind of specialty stuff.

192
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
Did he have a problem with Vance?

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,100
Matter of fact, Vance
crossed him about a year ago.

194
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,600
Probably cost him 50 grand in royalties.

195
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
You know the exact address?

196
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,900
426 bleecker.

197
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,400
Ask for chief.

198
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,000
Chief.

199
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Thank you.

200
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm, uh, here to see chief.

201
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,300
Stay here.

202
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,800
Don't touch anything.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You are really gonna
get it tonight, big boy.

204
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
There's been a misunderstanding.

205
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,200
I, uh, think I've been had.

206
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Oh, you ain't been had...

207
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,100
Till you been had by the chief.

208
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,900
Oh, and before we get started...

209
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,400
...what's your safe word?

210
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,000
What are you doing here, Ruby?

211
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,400
I should be asking you the same thing.

212
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm working a job.

213
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,500
The whole world's about
to be engulfed in hellfire,

214
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,800
And you're in magictown, u.S.A.

215
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,900
You got something against magic?

216
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,700
That would almost be funny if 34
seals hadn't been broken already.

217
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,800
34, Sam.

218
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,300
That's over halfway.

219
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,200
The angels are losing this war.

220
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,300
Every day is one day closer, and if
someone doesn't do something soon --

221
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
- And that someone is me?
- Who else would it be?

222
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,800
I don't know where these
seals are. I don't know squat.

223
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,500
So why don't you tell me
where you'd like me to start?

224
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, you can quit
dicking around, for one.

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,700
Bigger fish, Sam.

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And if the seals are being broken,

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,700
You might want to go after
the one doing the breaking.

228
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,500
Lilith?

229
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,600
Cut the head off the snake.

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,900
You're the only one
who can stop her, Sam.

231
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,700
So step up and kill the little bitch.

232
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,800
Oh, I'm game, believe me.

233
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,300
It's not the psychic
thing I got a problem with.

234
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,700
Yeah, I know what you got
a problem with, but tough.

235
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
It's the only way.

236
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,600
No.

237
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
You know, this would
all be so much easier

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,900
If you'd just admit to
yourself that you like it.

239
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
That feeling that it gives you.

240
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
You don't know what
you're talking about.

241
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, I don't, huh?

242
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Fine.

243
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,200
It's simple -- Lucifer
rises, the apocalypse starts.

244
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,900
You think that you have
demons on your hands now?

245
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,100
People are gonna die,
Sam. Oceans of people.

246
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,700
So, you just let me
know when you're ready.

247
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,500
- Find anything interesting?
- What?

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,400
Uh...no. You?

249
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Nothing I want to talk about
or think about ever again.

250
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,900
He's crazy, and you know it.

251
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,000
He says he can do it.

252
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Did you even try to talk him out of it?

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,500
Till I was blue in the face.

254
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,800
But I tell you, vernon, there was...

255
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,300
There was something in his eyes.

256
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,800
"In his eyes."

257
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,700
You're both nuts.

258
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
The chief, huh?

259
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,200
What's the matter?

260
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,000
The chief not your type?

261
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
You know, I could have you both
arrested for obstruction of justice.

262
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,000
How? You're no fed.

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We con people for a living, son.

264
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,100
Takes more than a fake
badge to get past us.

265
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,700
You got us.

266
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, we -- We
are actually...

267
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,300
Aspiring magicians.

268
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,600
Yeah, we -- We came to the convention
'cause we thought we could learn something.

269
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,500
Yeah, get some ideas for our new show.

270
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,100
Ooh, what kind of show?

271
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,700
Well, it's
-- It's a --

272
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,600
- It's a brother act.
- Yeah.

273
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,700
Yeah, you know, with the
rings and doves and...rings.

274
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,200
???

275
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,200
You want to learn something?

276
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Stick around.

277
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,800
Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
about to witness is a feat so daring,

278
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,600
So dangerous, even the great
Houdini dared not attempt it.

279
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
I give to you...

280
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,800
The executioner!

281
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,300
Now, sir, as you can see, this
jacket is the real article.

282
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,400
Thank you, sir. You may take your seat.

283
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,000
Now, I will have one
minute -- 60 seconds --

284
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,700
To escape certain death.

285
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
Let's see if I can do it.

286
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,600
I don't think he's gonna make it.

287
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,200
Oh! That was amazing!

288
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,100
That was freakin' amazing!

289
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,000
That was...

290
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,200
Not humanly possible.

291
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Looks like this guy Jay was
a pretty big deal in the '70s.

292
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,200
Which in magician land
means what, exactly?

293
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,800
Big enough to play
radio city music hall.

294
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,700
What got him stuck in their
"where are they now?" File?

295
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,500
He got old.

296
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Okay, so maybe incredible Jay

297
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,900
Is using real magic to stage a comeback.

298
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,500
It's possible. Some kind of spell
that works a death transference.

299
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
How does the tarot card mix into it?

300
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,900
I don't know.

301
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Man...

302
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,000
Hope I die before I get old.

303
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,000
Whole thing seems brutal, don't it?

304
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,500
You think we will?

305
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,300
What?

306
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,900
Die before we get old.

307
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,200
Haven't we both already?

308
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
You know what I mean, Dean. I mean,

309
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,100
Do you think we'll still be
chasing demons when we're 60?

310
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,300
No, I think we'll be dead...

311
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
For good.

312
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,600
What? You want to end up
like -- Like travis? Huh?

313
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,100
- Or gordon, maybe?
- There's bobby.

314
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,200
Oh, yeah, there's a poster
child for growing old gracefully.

315
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Maybe we'll be different, Dean.

316
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,700
What kind of kool-Aid
you drinking, man?

317
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Sammy, it ends bloody or sad.

318
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,800
That's just the life.

319
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,500
What if we could win?

320
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,300
"Win"?

321
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,800
If there was a way we could just...

322
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Put an end to all of it.

323
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,100
Is there something going
on you're not telling me?

324
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
- No.
- Sammy.

325
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,500
No. Look, I'm st saying...

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,300
I just wish there was a way we could...

327
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Go after the source. That's all.

328
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Cut the head off the snake.

329
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,800
Well, the problem with the snake
is that it has a thousand heads.

330
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,900
Evil bitches just keep
piling out of the volkswagen.

331
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Yeah.

332
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,900
Guess you're right.

333
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Why don't you go see if
you can track down Jay?

334
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,500
I'll see what I can dig
up on this tarot card.

335
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,800
Hey.

336
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,300
Maid found Jeb hanging
from the ceiling fan.

337
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,100
Police think it was a suicide.

338
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,300
I beg to differ.

339
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,100
Pulled a little sleight of hand myself.

340
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
On Dexter's body?

341
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,400
Yeah, so I'm thinking if this
spell is a death transference,

342
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,200
Then these cards work
like black-Magic targets.

343
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,600
Any connection between the victims?

344
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,000
Jeb was a total douche
bag to Jay yesterday.

345
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,700
What about the first vic? Uh, Vance?

346
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,600
Asked around. Apparently, Vance was heckling
Jay at the bar the day he was killed.

347
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,700
Okay, so Jay sneaks a
card into Vance's pocket,

348
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,000
Does the table of death...

349
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,700
And Vance takes 10 swords to the chest.

350
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,200
Then Jay slips a noose and Jeb doesn't.

351
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,900
- Hell of a trick.
- Yeah, I think it's time we had a little chat with Jay.

352
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,700
Any luck tailing him?

353
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,800
He slipped me.

354
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,200
He's a
60-Year-Old.

355
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,100
He's a magician.

356
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,900
Up against the wall!

357
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
- God, who are you? What do you want?
- Now!

358
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
We know what you've been up to.

359
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,900
You been working some real bad
mojo to jump-Start your act.

360
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,300
What?

361
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,100
I don't know what are you talking about.

362
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Look, we know you put a
spell on those tarot cards.

363
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,600
Messing with real magic?

364
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,800
"Real magic"?

365
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,800
Come on, there's no
such thing as real magic.

366
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Oh, is that so? Yeah, believe me.

367
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,400
I've been around this stuff
my whole life. It's all just --

368
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,800
It's -- It's
illusions. It's tricks.

369
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,200
It -- It's
all fake.

370
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,800
Jeb Dexter strung up --
Was that just an illusion?

371
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,400
What? Something happened to Jeb?

372
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,000
He was found hanged in his room.

373
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,700
Right after you slipped
the noose last night.

374
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

375
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Please...

376
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,700
Just let me go.

377
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,200
Something's not right.

378
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,200
Usually they're whipping some
badass hoodoo at us by now.

379
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,000
What do you want to do?

380
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,700
All right, so, if it's
not him, who is it?

381
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,200
Even if Jay's not working the
magic, he's still getting the reward.

382
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,300
His shows are selling out.

383
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,200
All right.

384
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,200
So, then, whoever it is,

385
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
They're obviously in Jay's corner.

386
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,100
All right, so we got vernon and
Charlie on the list. Anyone else?

387
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Uh...

388
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
We could always ask him.

389
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,800
Guess we should have
seen that one coming.

390
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,100
Come on. He couldn't
have gotten that far.

391
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,400
No way he could outrun us.

392
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,400
Maybe he vanished. I
mean, he really is good.

393
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,900
Or he found a back door.

394
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,900
That's them! Those are the two nut
jobs that just broke into my room!

395
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,200
???

396
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,900
They said my act is killing people.

397
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,500
They said that I was using real magic,
that I was casting spells on tarot cards.

398
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,300
"Real magic." Those guys are nuts.

399
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,900
You're lucky to be alive.

400
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,600
You don't think...

401
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,900
What?

402
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,300
Well, the things that I
can do now -- The cards.

403
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,700
You've been working the
cards your whole life.

404
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Well, what about the escapes?

405
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,900
I haven't been able to slip
a pair of cuffs in 30 years.

406
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,400
And then there was the way
that -- That patrick Vance died

407
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,200
And that Jeb Dexter.

408
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,400
Yeah, no great loss there.

409
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,900
Oh, Charlie, he didn't deserve to die.

410
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,400
You had nothing to do with it.

411
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,000
He was hanged the same night
that I performed the executioner.

412
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,200
Wait a minute.

413
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,000
Are you telling me that you
actually believe those guys?

414
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,600
That there was some kind
of "real magic" involved?

415
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
No.

416
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
I don't know.

417
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,300
I don't know, maybe.

418
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,800
I shouldn't go on tonight, Charlie.

419
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,000
Are you kidding me?

420
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,100
You have a sold-Out house out there.

421
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,600
Sold out!

422
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,400
When was the last time that happened?

423
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,200
The other night...

424
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,400
When I was doing the table of death,

425
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,100
I was, um...

426
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,300
...I was gonna kill myself.

427
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,600
And I have no idea how I got out alive.

428
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,600
But you did.

429
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,700
Somehow, you did.

430
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,700
Jay...

431
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,300
When you were in your day

432
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,600
You were incredible.

433
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,800
"The incredible Jay." You
were the best I ever saw.

434
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,600
And now you got it back.

435
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,700
I don't know how, but it doesn't matter.

436
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,000
Just to see you at the
top of your game again

437
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,500
Hell, it makes me feel young.

438
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,200
- But -- -
No buts, Jay.

439
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,400
This may be maa from
heaven, I don't know,

440
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,900
But whatever it is,

441
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,400
You don't throw it away.

442
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,100
Omg somebody gonna call the 911

443
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,300
- I don't know
- What's the...

444
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,200
Jay.

445
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
Thanks for dropping the charges.

446
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
You mind telling us why you did it?

447
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,600
We have to talk.

448
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,000
I was just a kid when we first met.

449
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,900
All I kn was how to cheat at cards.

450
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Charlie got me out of more
scrapes than I can count.

451
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,400
Hell, I would have been dead by the
age of 20 if it hadn't been for him.

452
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:03,749
[ Sighs ]
he was more than my friend.

453
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:04,949
He was my brother.

454
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,181
Sam: I'm sorry, Jay.

455
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:10,248
Look, I should have listened
to you guys

456
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:12,715
When you told me that my show
was killing people.

457
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:15,515
Well, you weren't the one
pulling the trigger.

458
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:18,016
Yeah, but someone did,
and I want to find out
who did this to Charlie,

459
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,882
So I'll do whatever you guys
say.

460
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:22,815
Just tell me what to do.

461
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:25,849
Jay,
whoever's doing this...

462
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:27,682
They like you.

463
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:31,016
They're probably
close to you.

464
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:34,382
Did Charlie and vernon
get along?

465
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,916
No.

466
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:39,515
No, it's not vernon.

467
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:42,016
He's the only one
that makes sense.

468
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:45,315
Charlie and vernon
were your family, Jay.

469
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:46,916
And now Charlie's gone.

470
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:50,849
Yeah, but...they butted heads
sometimes,

471
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:55,582
But vernon could never do
something like this.

472
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:58,315
See, the thing about
real magic

473
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:01,115
Is it's a whole lot
like crack.

474
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:03,849
People do surprising things
once they get a taste of it.

475
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:11,016
You better be damn sure
about this.

476
00:31:11,048 --> 00:31:13,815
Vernon's all I got left.

477
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,615
Yeah?

478
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:29,081
Yeah, okay.

479
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:30,882
I'll be there in two shakes.

480
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:33,684
I got something to tell you
anyway.

481
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:59,515
Sam: wow.
It's like a...magic museum.

482
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:01,708
Hdst be in heaven.

483
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,449
This guy
doesn't travel light.

484
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,440
He's been on the road
his whole life.

485
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:07,923
Probably everything he owns
is in this room.

486
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:09,307
Let's get started.

487
00:32:22,614 --> 00:32:24,090
Just talked to the head
of the convention.

488
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,632
Headliner gig isatours.

489
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:32,217
What?

490
00:32:33,474 --> 00:32:34,444
You don't want it?

491
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:37,493
A day ago,

492
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:39,944
Ou told me I'd be standing
on this stage...

493
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:44,328
No, I can't do it,
vernon.

494
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:46,144
What are you
talking about?

495
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,099
Charlie's gone.

496
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:52,288
Charlie would have wanted you
to go on.

497
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:53,308
This is your shot.

498
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:54,882
<i>It's our shot.</i>

499
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,517
Really?

500
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,574
This is what Charlie
would have wanted?

501
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:03,090
Charlie's dead.

502
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,751
Hey, he was my friend, too,
you know.

503
00:33:08,493 --> 00:33:10,293
It's a hell of a way
to treat a friend.

504
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,282
Again,
what are you talking about?

505
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,145
You killed him,
didn't you?

506
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,515
And for what?

507
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:20,460
<i>So that I --
So that we could be back on top?</i>

508
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:21,897
That's insane.

509
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:24,345
[ Chuckles ]
no, you're scaring me.

510
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,379
First it was Vance,
then it was jet .

511
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:28,586
Even if you thought
you were doing it r me,

512
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:32,508
How in god's name
could you kill Charlie?

513
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,957
Oh, you are crazy.

514
00:33:35,468 --> 00:33:38,422
You used me, and you used my act
to do this to him.

515
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,608
If you think --
Man: I wouldn't be
so hard on him, Jay.

516
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:43,043
He didn't do it.

517
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,089
This is just a bunch
of old-Timey magic stuff --

518
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:50,064
None of it magic.

519
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:54,275
No herbs, no candles,
and no tarot cards.

520
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:00,114
I'll be damned.

521
00:34:00,947 --> 00:34:01,502
What?

522
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:05,298
Look like anyone we know?

523
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:10,884
Sweet mary and joseph.

524
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:15,220
Charlie.

525
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:18,960
It's really me, Jay.

526
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:22,424
Vernon:
how the hell...

527
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:25,242
God, you forget
what it feels like to be young.

528
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:27,832
It's amazing.

529
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,813
How old are you?

530
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:31,251
Oh, it depends
on what you mean by "old."

531
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:33,112
Right now, technically,
about 28,

532
00:34:34,221 --> 00:34:35,929
But I've been around
a lot longer than that.

533
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,056
How long?

534
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:41,253
Long enough to have shilled
for barnum.

535
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:43,096
And he gave me something.

536
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:43,998
What's that?

537
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:46,876
The grimoire --
A book of real magic.

538
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,817
At first,
I thought it was a scam,

539
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:51,128
But then I tried one of
the spells, and it worked.

540
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,711
In fact, they all worked.

541
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:55,944
So when I got to the end and
there was one for immortality...

542
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,348
My god, Charlie.

543
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:01,030
And my show,
the things that I can do.

544
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:01,957
Different spell.

545
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:04,407
But it gives you a little taste
of what's possible.

546
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:10,314
Oh, no, I wouldn't touch those,
vernon.

547
00:35:10,914 --> 00:35:12,349
They're --
They're still radioactive.

548
00:35:14,795 --> 00:35:17,240
You killed Vance
and Jeb Dexter.

549
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:19,228
What, you think this is
a parlor game?

550
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:22,232
You were being humiliated
by those punks.

551
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:25,603
A washed-Up old man who
couldn't even defend himself.

552
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,165
You used me
to do these terrible things.

553
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:29,905
I used them
to give you a gift.

554
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:33,898
And you wanted it, Jay.
I saw it in your eyes.

555
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,812
No, I never wanted this.

556
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:38,578
You were ready
to kill yourself.

557
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:41,026
I saved your life.

558
00:35:41,628 --> 00:35:43,014
Is that right, Jay?

559
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:46,847
I was there for you,
like I've always been.

560
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,587
Like I'll always be.

561
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,944
Va with me,
both of you.

562
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,933
You think the first time around
was good?

563
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,367
The second time's
even better.

564
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,588
All the know-How,
none of the aches and pain.

565
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:04,172
No, I won't do this.
I won't.

566
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:06,668
I've never made this offer
before.

567
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,166
But, then again,
I've never had friends

568
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:09,549
Like the two of yofore.

569
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,641
Let me do this for you.

570
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:16,441
And who else has to die
so that we can live forever?

571
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:19,997
What's the price tag
on immortality?

572
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:22,633
This isn't right, Charlie,
what you're doing.

573
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:23,375
You know that.

574
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:25,181
Somewhere, you know that.

575
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,504
I know I don't want
to come back alone,

576
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:30,367
To start all over, alone.

577
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,186
Jay...

578
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:35,681
We can be young again.

579
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:39,155
The three of us together --
Vital anrne...

580
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:40,543
Foreve

581
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:42,347
Dean: not so fast!

582
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:45,905
I ain't guttenberg,
and this ain't "cocoon."

583
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:58,910
Immortality.
That's a neat trick.

584
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:02,512
It's not a trick.
It's magic.

585
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:10,446
Hey, bullet catch --
Been working on that.

586
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:13,033
Get him!

587
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:18,523
Let him go -- Now!

588
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,973
Just leave me
and my friends alone.

589
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,346
All right, I will give it up --
The spells, the hexes.

590
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,518
This is the last time.
I promise.

591
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,495
Jay...

592
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,654
You picked
these strangers over me?

593
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:53,124
You okay?

594
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:54,662
Yeah.

595
00:38:55,818 --> 00:38:56,513
Yeah, I'm all right.

596
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:27,261
Hey, Jay.

597
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,157
We wanted to thank you

598
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,526
For what you did
yesterday.

599
00:39:36,004 --> 00:39:38,083
I killed my best friend
yesterday,

600
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:39,336
And you want to thank me?

601
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,569
Where's vernon?

602
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:48,820
Oh, he's gone.

603
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:50,725
He said he didn't want
to speak to me again

604
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,391
After what I did to Charlie.

605
00:39:55,346 --> 00:39:56,362
Listen, Jay...

606
00:39:57,426 --> 00:39:59,641
You know Charlie was never
gonna give up what he was doing.

607
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:01,261
Ever.

608
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:03,618
You did the right thing.

609
00:40:04,356 --> 00:40:05,605
Are you sure about that?

610
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,007
You know,
Charlie was like my brother.

611
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:10,892
And now he's dead...

612
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:13,821
Because I did
"the right thing."

613
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,499
He offered me a gift, and I just
threw it back in his face.

614
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:26,187
So have to h the res
of my life old and alone.

615
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,256
!@Uat's so right
about that?

616
00:40:38,927 --> 00:40:41,651
Jay...your cards.

617
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,449
Well, I don't know about you,
but...I could go for a beer.

618
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:04,551
I'm gonna take a walk.

619
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:27,938
Okay.

620
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:29,660
I'm in.

621
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:36,353
What changed your mind?

622
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,476
I don't want to be doing this
when I'm an old man.

623
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:50,194
