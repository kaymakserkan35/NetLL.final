00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,430
So, you got a Green Beret,
a Navy SEAL
and a sister from Brooklyn.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,600
The general hands
each of them a gun and says,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,000
"Your spouse
is seated next door
in a room in a chair.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,600
"In order to pass this test,
you must go inside
and kill them."

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,470
Lmmediately
the Green Beret says,

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,240
"No, sir,
I could never kill my wife.
I just can't do it."

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,340
The General looks at him
and says, "You know what?

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,680
"You ain't got what it takes.
Take your wife
and go on home."

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,950
Navy Seal then heads in.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,890
Five minutes later, comes out,
tears strolling down his face.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,050
"I tried, I tried, I tried,
I just can't do it,

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,460
"she looked so beautiful
in the chair,
I can't do it."

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,360
General looks at him and says,
"You know what?

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,900
"You ain't got what it takes."

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,330
Finally, sister from Brooklyn
strolls in with a swagger.

there's banging,
there's screaming,
it's going crazy!

Suddenly,
everything goes silent.

The General says,
"Well, what the hell
happened inside?"

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,240
The sister from Brooklyn
screams back,

"The damn gun
had blanks in it,

00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,750
"so I had to beat him to death

What the hell?

25
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,880
A little bit of warning
would have been nice!

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,360
The sound of a saw
cutting a hole in the wall

27
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,450
wasn't warning enough?

28
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,720

a guy get that big?

Don't look at me.

46
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,470
Please tell me
dead guys can fart.

47
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,570
Of course.
Dead bodies are full of
all sorts of gases.

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,010
But a dead body
can't tighten a sphincter.

49
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,810
You need a tight sphincter
to make a fart.

50
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,240
No, you need
a loose sphincter.
A tight sphincter...

51
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,940
You check his femoral?

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,850
No. He peed all over himself!

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,410

54

sit straight up on a gurney.

55
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,620
Trust me, his skin's cold,
pupils are fixed and dilated,
he's not breathing.

56
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,420
He's got a pulse!
No way.

and an EKG.

Forty-six-year-old guy

61
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,800
Doesn't appear to be
anything wrong with him

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,170
except for the fact
that he weighs
over 600 pounds.

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,640
What time
does he usually get in?

64
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,300
Any time between
8:00 and 10:00.

65
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,210
Did you say 600?
At least.

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,050
Biggest scale we got
only goes up to 350

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,550
but this guy's waistline
is over seven feet.

68
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,450
Which means he's a diabetic
with blood thicker
than pancake batter.

Nothing.

and driving
without a license.

93
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,470
The fact that you're you
explains the illegal
possession of narcotics

98
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,780
that I didn't treat him
with the deference
due to a man of his stature.

99
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,480

Improperly prepared
puffer fish

117
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,930

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,740
He's probably
at the track.

121
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,900
If he's at the track
he'd tell us
so we don't have to page him,

122
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,500
and if it was a puffer fish,
he'd be dead
in six to eight hours, tops.

123
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,050
He's been in a coma
at least 24.

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,050
And the guy
didn't get to 600 pounds
eating a load of sushi.

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,750
What if he was
in a motorcycle accident?

126
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,480

But how'd he get back in bed?

Oh, Cameron's talking

128
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,290
You ever see how he drives?

129
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,390
No, we haven't.

130
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,520
But I have seen
how many pills
he's been popping lately,

131
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,120
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's in a coma
somewhere himself.

132
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,230
If I am, this is
one lame hallucination.

133
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,330
What happened to you?

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,740

But the wall
between Wilson's office

139
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,840
and this one
is thinner than you'd think.

140
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,010
Which means
we need to stop talking

141
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,710
about what a pathetic loser
he is.

142
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,250
Start treating Jabba
for pickwickian syndrome.

143
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,380
His 96 double-Zs
are probably putting pressure
on his chest, suffocating him.

144
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,220
CO2 and oxygen
sats are normal.

145
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,850
For you and me.
What's normal
for a hippopotamus?

146
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,260
And get
a detailed medical history.

147
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,590
From who?
He was brought in alone.

148
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,100
And I doubt a guy
who weighs 600 pounds
bothers with annual physicals.

149
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,930
Talk to the neighbors
and search the house.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,200
Let's see what else
Shamu's been up to
besides eating.

151
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,070
This conversation is over

152
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,770
because I've officially
run out of clever things
to call the guy.

153
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,040
It's hard to believe

154
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,720
you can even attach
this much flesh
to a human skeleton.

155
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,760
CHASE: I wouldn't exactly
call this attached.

156
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,920
This is ridiculous.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,560
A person shouldn't be able to
eat themselves into oblivion

158
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,530
and then just expect everyone
to pull out the stops
to fix everything.

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,430
What are we supposed to do?
Refuse treatment
to anyone who's obese?

160
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,270
Come on, give me a break.
This guy's not obese.

161
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,040
He's not even morbidly obese.
He's suicidal.

162
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,740
People who attempt suicide
get treated.

163
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,710
Plenty of noncompliant
diabetics don't.

164
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,580
We don't give
drug addicts dialysis

165
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,880
or alcoholics
liver transplants.

166
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,440
What is your problem?

167
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,040

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,020
Yeah. I'm the one
with the problem.

170
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,490
So, I think
his bedroom's through there,

171
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,760
and the kitchen's
to the left.

172
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,760
Have you seen any changes
in his personality?

173
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,060
Any trouble with memory
or balance?

174
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,040
No, but I really
don't see him that often.

175
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,770
He's not unfriendly
or anything,

176
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,900
I guess he just likes
to keep to himself.

177
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,910
I think he only gave me
a spare set of keys
'cause I gave him mine.

178
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,470
What?

179
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,510
Nothing. Just reminds me
of someone I know.
Who is unfriendly.

180
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,110
Does George have a job?

181
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,310
He has a headhunting business
he runs from home.

182
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,360
Occasionally
he'll interview people here,

183
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,590
but he does most of it
over the phone.

184
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,820
Wow!

185
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,760
Yeah, he loves to cook.

186
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,020
And eat, obviously.

187
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,470
Four-course gourmet meals
almost every night,

188
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,730
sometimes for lunch, too.

189
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,830
Do you know if he ever uses
any unpasteurized cheese
or wild game?

190
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,030
I'm not sure.

191
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,940
He gets all his groceries
delivered from
that market down on Alden.

192
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,670
They'd probably know.

193
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,420
He have any friends?
No.

194

do come by.

195

never the same one twice,

196
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,650

I'm usually okay.

I don't know, not doing that?

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,380
Yeah. But it's how I sleep,
it's how I've always slept.

You're not sleeping
on some cartilage,
you're sleeping on your arm.

Cuddy's looking for
a sperm donor?

234
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,540
It was a joke.
Like Cuddy
would ever want a kid.

235
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,710

Pianos and prostitutes.

246
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,600
We should do an LP
and look for neurosyphilis.

247
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,570
It's not syphilis.
How do you know?

248
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,730
Because you get STDs
from people you trust,

the need to
protect yourself from.

250
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,670

is connected to his gut,
not what's below it.

251

MRI his brain,
look for clots.

252
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,450
Weight limit
on the MRI machine
is 450 pounds.

253
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,920
So do a CT.

254
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,510
Limit's 350.

255
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,110
Then just start treatment.

256
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,120
If we give him blood thinners
and the coma's caused

257
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,720
by a bleed instead of a clot,
we could kill him.

258
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,130
Either start treatment
or start building
a stronger MRI.

259
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Whatever you do, do it fast.

260
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,830
The longer
he stays in the coma,

261
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,660
the less likely it is
he'll ever wake up.

262
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,000
There's no way.

263
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,840
His head's the only part
that we have to
get in the machine.

264
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,280
If we can just
get him on the table...

265
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,180
We get him on the table,
we break the table.

266
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,270
We break the table,

267
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,750
hospital's out
a million dollars
and we're out of our jobs.

268
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,980
The weight limit's
obviously just an estimation.

269
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,320
It's not like if it can hold
450 pounds fine,

270
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,580
it'll instantly collapse
under 451.

271
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,120
He's not one pound over,
he's 150 pounds over.

272
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,220
I don't care!

273
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,590
He still deserves
the same standard of care
as anyone else.

will stand on principle.

a lot more than that.

just some

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,480
Yeah.

336
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,120
Looks like Cameron's
gonna be having
a lot more ideas in future.

337
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,060
Who knew that
being bloated and bitchy
could actually come in handy?

338
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,830
Shut up.
What if it is hormones?

339
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,230
It's not hormones.

340
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,500
I'm talking about George.

341
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,340
Acute adrenal insufficiency
could cause a temporary coma.

342
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,210
A glandular problem
would cause his temperature
to be low, not high.

343
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,570
Maybe the fever's
not related.

344
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,370
If it's not related,
there's nothing to talk about.

345
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,210
We should do
an ACTH stimulation test

346
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,250
and check his skin
for acanthosis nigricans.

347
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,510
Or the fever is related
and so are the prostitutes.

348
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,390
We should do a full STD panel
and check his genitals
for chancres.

349
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,680
CHASE: We should do nothing.

350
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,950
Just keep him a couple of days
for observation.

351
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,050
If he doesn't get any worse,

352
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,890
it was probably
just a hematoma
that dissipated on its own.

353
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,390
Or we do all of the above.

354
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,860
You check his belly
for patches.

355
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,670
You check underneath
for sores.

356
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,040
And you just sit on your ass.

357
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,840
Acanthosis nigricans
is a hyperpigmentation
of the skin,

358
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,680
usually indicates some sort
of hormonal imbalance.

359
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,720
There's nothing wrong
with my hormones.

360
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,720
It's the first thing
every doctor
I've ever gone to has checked.

361
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,590
Then it's the blood pressure,
then it's gotta be diabetes.

362
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,060
They all figure
there's gotta be
something wrong with me.

363
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,160
You having any problems
with your vision?

364
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,290
No, I have nystagmus.
I've had it since birth,
I'm fine.

365
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,460
You're not fine.
You were in a coma
for two days.

366
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,630
There's something wrong
with you.

367
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,870
Was something wrong with me,
now I'm better,
now I'd like to go home.

368
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,210
A coma's not like
a stomach ache.

369
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,610
You can't just shrug it off
and hope
it's not anything serious.

370
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,150
My company places
a lot of insurance executives.

371
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,320
There are over 300,000 deaths
caused each year
by medical mistakes

372
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,520
and hospital-associated
infections.
I'll come in for tests.

373
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,090
There are over 400,000 deaths
caused by
obesity-related illnesses.

374
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,830
The CDC says those figures
are a gross overestimation.

375
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,130
George, you ever notice
you don't see
a lot of obese old men?

376
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,470
If I'm gonna
have a heart attack,

377
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,040
I would rather it be caused
by a perfect
pan-roasted ris de veau

378
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,120
than running 26 miles
for no reason other than
to brag that I can do it.

379
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,420
Or to have an MRI machine
break in
the middle of a procedure!

380
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,980
We're sorry about that.

381
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,360
It was the only way
to rule out a stroke
or brain hemorrhage.

382
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,690
And now that you have,
when can I go?

383
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,100
<i>(WOMAN CHATTERING</i>
<i>ON PA S YSTEM)</i>

384
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,230
It's probably her mom.

385
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,800
I bet she's huge.
She's from the Midwest.

386
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,270
Since when do you eat beets?

387
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,580
Since I was five.

388
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,880
And who are we talking about?
You know,
just in case you need me

389
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,010
to chime in and tell you
you're a lunatic
at some point?

390
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,650
Cameron. She's lying,
destroying hospital equipment,

391
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,020
telling Cuddy off.

392
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,460
I gotta find out
where she got
the Fat Scratch Fever.

393
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,860
Yeah, you definitely better
get to the bottom of that.

394
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,590
I heard Cuddy gave you
the name of a lawyer.

395
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,530
Or it could just be pity.
She feels guilty
about being born beautiful.

396
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,160
So she overcompensates
by being nice to ugly people.

397
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,170
Would explain why
she gets along
so well with you.

398
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,940
From what I hear,
the patient reminds her
of you, not me.

399
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,000
Call the lawyer.

400
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,310
Cameron sees a clump of dirt
and she thinks of me.

401
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,280
Or a lump of something else.
You're a lunatic.
Call the lawyer.

402
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,580
Very mature.
You started it.

403
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,660
Skin exam
and ACTH stimulation test
were both normal.

404
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,780
He has nystagmus
but it's congenital.

405
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,190
No way it's related
to the coma.

406
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,590
You say, "No way,"
I say... Yeah, no way.

407
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,900
Blood and urine were negative
for chlamydia,
herpes, and syphilis.

408
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,900
Looks like
we got ourselves a mystery.

409
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,340
Not for long.
He wants to be discharged.

410
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,810
Oh, sure.
Places to go, people to eat.

411
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,000
He insists
his chance of dying

412
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,340
from a hospital-acquired
infection

413
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,570
is greater than him dying
from whatever caused his coma.

414
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,710
Did you tell him
that statistics also say
that he's a big, fat idiot?

415
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,720
Yeah, I did.
He's not backing down.

416
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,690
He says
if we don't discharge him,
he'll leave AMA.

417
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,210
Selectively rational,
stubborn, uncooperative,

check his leg.

If I were him...

423

Maybe it's not
such a mystery after all.

Putting chopped parsley
in a hamburger

427

a Salisbury steak make.

And you must be

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,300
Right. Fat joke. Always fun.

you can still make fun of.

And Christians.
Oh, and black people.

433
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,470
No one in their right mind
comes out of a coma

434
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,940
and immediately asks
to go home
with an unknown condition,

435
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,740
which means that either
you're not in your right mind

436
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,300
or it's not
an unknown condition.

437
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,540
So, what is it?
You tried to off yourself?

438
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,780
You figure I'm fat,
therefore I hate myself.

439
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,320
Yeah, that's a huge leap
of logic.

440
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,790
I don't wanna die.
I just don't wanna be here.

441
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,130
Then it's a condition
you've already had diagnosed,

442
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,820
or it's something
you know you've inherited.

443
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,260
Let's see, your stomach
has deep-seated feelings

of abandonment
written all over it,

445
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,900
which points toward
sexual abuse.

446
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,870
While a fear of hospitals,
that points to a more
specific traumatic event.

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,920
We have no idea
what's wrong with the guy.

500
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,020
For all we know
he could be dead
in 12 hours.

501
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,120
He does not want our help.

502
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,360
Which means
he doesn't want your help.

503
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,340
He's obviously
just rationalizing.
And so are you!

504
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,870
You would never give up
this easy

505
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,310
if you weren't so busy
dealing with
your own personal problems.

506
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,870
Send him home.

507
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,880
What did you tell that cop?

508
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,940
Nothing.

509
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,240
Nothing as in nothing?

510
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,780
Or as in nothing
that could cause him to think

511
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,480
I have a stash
in my apartment?

512
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,580
He called to see
if I prescribed the pills,
I said yes. That's all.

513
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,650
Obviously not.
What happened?

514
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,820
He searched my house,
found a buttload of pills.

515
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,460
Guy's gotta be prepared
for a rainy day.

516
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,790
Last I checked
pharmacies were still open
when it rained.

517
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,390
And because I never know
when you're gonna be
in one of your moods

518
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,460
and cut me off.

519
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,730
Oh, it's my fault.

520
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,400
I'm not the one
who talked to the cop.

521
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,470
Well, I'm not the one
who put a thermometer
in his rectum.

522
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,980
So stop yelling at me
and start talking
to your lawyer.

523
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,380
Is there someone
who can check on you?

524
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,440
Oh, don't worry.

525
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,680
There's gonna be a whole crew
of carpenters in my bedroom

526
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,690
for the next week at least.

527
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,360
You know, there's an
Overeaters Anonymous meeting
here at the hospital.

528
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,730
If I wanted to
jump out of airplanes
or climb Mount Everest,

529
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,530
would you be telling me
to go to
Daredevils Anonymous?

530
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,730
I would be worried about you
just like I am now.

531
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,930
Don't be.

532
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,710
I enjoy food.

533
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,840
I like cooking it,
I like looking at it,
I like smelling it,

534
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,240
and I especially
like eating it.

535
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,810
Listen, whatever happens
is gonna happen.

536
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,180
Ultimately it's all
out of our control anyway.

537
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,550
Why doesn't
that philosophy apply

538
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,250
to medical mistakes
and hospital-acquired
infections as well?

539
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,790
I'm a complicated man,
Dr. Cameron.

540
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,830
But don't worry,
I plan on staying that way
for a long time.

541
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,630
Wait, wait, let us take you
all the way outside.

542
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,760
I'm fine.

543
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,270
It doesn't matter,
it's hospital rules.

544
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,540
Oh, screw the rules.
I've been on my back
for four days.

545
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,980
I need the exercise, right?

546
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,880
George, come on,
let us just take you
to the taxi.

547
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,210
Don't worry, I may not
be able to climb Everest,
but I can walk, okay?

548
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,750
George...
Now enough already.

549
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,930
George, are you all right?

550
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,000
George? You all right? George?

551
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,010
FOREMAN: Disorientation
and loss of balance

552
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,310
could mean
a neurofibromatosis.

553
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,820
Where's Chase?
Don't know.

554
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,510
Haven't seen him
since you told him
to sit on his ass yesterday.

555
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,990
Interesting.

556
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,620
NF2 is also inherited,
which means I was right.

557
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,790
You kept saying
it was pickwick's.

558
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,690
Between the first pickwick's
and the second pickwick's,
I said it was inherited.

559
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,730
Whatever.
NF2 doesn't explain fever.

560
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,630
I think we should focus
on the coma and the fever.

561
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,900
Why? The disorientation
and loss of balance
are more recent.

562
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,440
The coma was
the most severe symptom.

563
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,740
But he's not
in the coma anymore
and he is disoriented.

564
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,640
No, he's not.

565
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,080
We have a rather large piece
of tempered glass
that begs to differ.

566
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,840
I just mean
it's not connected.

567
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,320
You don't know that.

568
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,410
Yeah, I do.

569
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,750
How could
you possibly know...

570
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,450
Because I did it!

571
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,790
I didn't think
he should be discharged,

572
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,490
so I gave him
three grams of phenytoin.

573
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,520
I wasn't gonna just
let him leave.

574
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,230
But you were okay with him
crashing through a glass wall?

575
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,030
I tried to keep him
in the wheelchair,
but he's tough to stop.

576
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,100
Nice audible, Peyton.

577
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,010
So, what do we do now?

578
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,010
Discharge report says
he didn't eat his breakfast.

579
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,910
Humpty Dumpty
didn't get to be the size
of all the king's horses

580
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,850
by skipping
the most important meal
of the day.

581
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,720
What causes coma, fever,
and loss of appetite?

582
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,950
It can't be Chagas',
he's never been
outside the country.

583
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,150
But his stomach has.

584
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,720
The food we eat
no longer comes from
America's heartland.

585
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,280
It comes from South America's
deforested jungle land

586
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,090
where lettuce now grows
and lettuce pickers now poop.

587
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,430
Get a sample of his CSF

588
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,560
before the little bugs that
are now feasting on his brain
move on to dessert.

589
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,000
How are we gonna do that?
He's too big to do an LP.

590
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,000
So go straight to the source.

591
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,410
You wanna drill a hole
in my head?

592
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,640
It's the only way.

593
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,780
It's gotta be something
other than a parasite.

594
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,180
I buy my produce
at the best market in town
and I always wash it.

595
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,160
Leafy vegetables
can suck contaminated water

596
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,890
through their roots
right into the plant.

597
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,550
You could have
washed them in chlorine

598
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,490
and it still
wouldn't have mattered.

599
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,090
Then other people
would be sick as well.

600
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,760
The parasites could have been
on only a few items,

601
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,770
or maybe they just didn't eat
as much as you did.

602
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,670
It's always
about my weight, isn't it?

603
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,330
Why can't you people
come up with one theory...

604
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,770
This one fits, George.

605
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,040
It explains your coma,
your fever,
your loss of appetite...

606
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,180
And the disorientation?

607
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,410
It's all explained.

608
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,720
And if we don't treat it
while it's still
in the acute stage,

609
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,020
it'll be too late.

610
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,550
It could go on
to infect your heart,
intestines, esophagus...

611
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,030
This is what I get
for eating salad.

612
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,270
(DRILLING MACHINE WHIRRING)

613
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,340
FOREMAN: Suction.
NURSE: Suction.

614
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,020
Aspirator.

615
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,190
Your turn.

616
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,590
Irrigation.

617
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,890
Sponge.

618
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,270
What did you do?

619
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,530
Nothing. Why, what's wrong?

620
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,630
(STUTTERING) I can't see.

621
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,400
Vision's blurry
or you've lost...

622
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,940
I didn't lose it,
you took it from me!

623
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,770
George, calm down.
I can't see!

624
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,040
Give me some lorazepam!

625
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,010
What did you do to me?
Hold still!

626
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,510
George! George!
What's going on?

627
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,710
No. No. Calm down!
What did you do to me?

628
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,520
There's no inflammation
in the optic nerve
and his retina's intact.

629
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,020
The blindness
has to have been caused
by something in his brain.

630
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,080
And not surprisingly
there was no sign of Chagas'

631
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,130
or any other
parasites in his CSF.

632
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,360
So we've ruled out
his parents,

633
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,830
prostitutes, the arugula.
Means either...

634
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,270
I took the sample
from the prefrontal.

635
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,200
I was never anywhere
near his visual cortex.

636
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,000
Or you missed a tumor
on the MRI.

637
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,870
Not a chance,
the MRI was clean.

638
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,740
You mind?
Where are you going?

639
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,470
To get a $400 butt plug.

640
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,670
What about George?

641
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,010
He's gonna have to
get his own. Come on.

642
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,680
Let's see if we can
get this thing figured out

643
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,280
by the time
we get to the elevator.

644
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,880
It could be MS.

645
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,550
Would explain the coma,
the blindness,

646
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,990
loss of balance,
and the fever.

647
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,920
Could also explain
his lack of concern
for his health.

648
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,590
MS can cause
excessive cheerfulness.

649
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,960
Yeah, he's a delight.

650
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,400
You don't get to MS
with coma
as the first symptom.

651
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,900
Blindness plus coma
says diabetes. Just in time.

652
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,030
No. Blood sugar,
urine dip stick and
hemoglobin A1c are normal.

653
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,660
Were normal when you tested.

654
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,870
He's been
in and out of a coma,

655
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,500
whatever's going on
is waxing and waning,

656
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,570
unlike his pants size,
which only waxes.

657
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,310
Which also points to diabetes.
Test him again.

658
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,750
And this time add
a glucose tolerance test
and an HEC.

659
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,480
We already have
a CSF sample,

660
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,210
we might as well
check it for proteins
to rule out MS first.

661
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,780
Agreed. Except for the part
about doing it first.

662
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,850
Where are you going?

663
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,390
The butt plug
was my way of saying,
"Mind your own business."

664
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,160
Apparently too subtle.

665
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,430
George, all it is
is sugar water, I promise.

666
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,130
Just because I'm overweight
doesn't make me diabetic!

667
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,300
You tested me,
everybody's tested me.

668
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,070
Sometimes
the blood sugar levels
can fluctuate,

669
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,400
make it difficult
to diagnose.

670
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,840
You stuck a needle in my brain
and 10 seconds later
I was blind!

671
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,740
How is that difficult
to diagnose?

672
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,250
Who the hell knows
what else you guys
done to me?

673
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,110
I should have
never come here!
You didn't come here,

674
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,090
you were brought here
because you were in a coma
and barely alive.

675
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,850
We didn't do that to you,
you need to let us figure out
what did.

676
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,790
For someone who insists
he enjoys life
as much as you do,

677
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,830
you certainly
don't seem willing
to do much to prolong it.

678
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,360
Yeah,

679
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:23,100
because I don't agree
with the brilliant doctors,
suddenly I'm suicidal!

680
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,700
Refusing to cooperate with us
does not make you suicidal,
it makes you an idiot.

681
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,540
You think
we want to see you blind
or in a coma?

682
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,840
I've been fat all my life.

683
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,420
I've only been sick
for the past few days.

684
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,290
You look for a disease
that has nothing to do
with my size,

685
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,950
and I will help you.

686
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,790
Otherwise, leave me alone.

687
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,330
Speeding, DUI,
reckless driving,

688
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,340
resisting arrest,
possession of
a class three narcotic.

689
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,600
And now it looks like
they've added

690
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,170
another possession
with intent
to traffic charge as well.

691
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,440
They found some pills
at your house.

692
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,710
All of which
I had a prescription for.

693
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,810
That's a lot of pills.

694
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,680
I'm in a lot of pain.

695
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,290
This is all because some cop
came into the clinic,

696
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,020
I was rude to him,
this is his way
of getting back at me.

697
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,320
You've made it pretty easy.

698
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,990
His insane reaction
to a simple
rectal thermometer reading

699
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,730
probably says
a lot more about his mother
than it says about me.

700
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,540
I'm inclined to think
your particular charm

701
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,000
may not be immediately
appreciated by a jury.

702
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm not interested
in a plea bargain.

703
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,310
It's your best bet
to make this go away.

704
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,320
There is no this.
There's a him.

705
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,250
The only thing I'm guilty of
is humiliating a bully.

706
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,850
I wasn't speeding,
I wasn't impaired,
I didn't resist,

707
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,720
and I certainly was not
distributing narcotics

708
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,990
to anyone but myself,

709
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,090
because I need
those narcotics.

710
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,420
Five grand retainer.

711
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,770
If we end up going to trial,
there'll be another 30 due
before the first day.

712
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,860
My hourly is 450.
That work for you?

713
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,610
What'd your lawyer say?

714
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,040
I looked up butt plug
in a legal dictionary.
What'd he say?

715
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,550
That a smile like mine
can't lose.

716
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,380
What did the tests say?

717
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,450
You were right about MS.
No myelin basic proteins
in his CSF.

718
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,860
What about diabetes?
Don't know.

719
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,120
He says
we only think it's diabetes

720
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,890
because of his weight,
won't let us test him.

721
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,310
So, you would rather
be a blind invalid
than admit the fact

722
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,150
that maybe you might have
a little problem
with overeating.

723
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,280
By a little problem,
of course,

724
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,220
I mean you've eaten yourself
half to death.

725
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,550
And you would rather
let me die
than consider the fact

726
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,850
that whatever is wrong with me
has nothing to do
with my weight.

727
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,290
I go where the symptoms
tell me to go.

728
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,260
And right now
they're asking why this stuff

729
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,460
is the first thing
you've ever refused
to swallow.

730
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,760
I am not diabetic.

731
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,360
Grocery stores
giving away medical degrees
with the free turkeys now?

732
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,430
The sooner you drink this,

733
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,500
the sooner I get to go
waste my time
with something else.

734
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,130
Get the hell off of me!

735
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,110
No dessert
till you've finished
your dinner!

736
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,040
George, just drink it!

737
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,280
Nurse!

738
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,050
Get this jackass off of me!

739
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,610
What the hell is going on?

742
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,730
Let go!

743
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,710
What's going on?

744
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,720
Get X-rays of his hands.
Then bronc him,
do a sputum cytology

745
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,090
and check his CSF
for anti-hu antibodies.

746
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,320
How are we gonna get him
to do all that,

747
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,020
we can't even
get him to drink a bottle
of sugar water?

748
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,580
Tell him that lung cancer
is in no way
connected to obesity.

749
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,890
You don't think
he'll realize we're lying?

750
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,430
You're not.
Lung cancer's got nothing
to do with obesity.

751
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,160
I meant about him
having lung cancer.

752
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,430
You didn't notice
his fingers?

753
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,770
I noticed they were fat.

754
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,170
You should have
pissed him off,

755
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,300
he would have grabbed you.

756
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,530
Then you would have
felt the bones,

757
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,200
they're not just fat,
they're clubbed.

758
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,280
George,

759
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,910
it's me.

760
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,060
Your tests were positive.

761
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,190
You have a small cell
lung carcinoma.

762
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,630
It caused a paraneoplastic
neurologic syndrome,

763
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,600
which in turn
caused your blindness
and coma.

764
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,860
The cancer's metastasized
to your lymph nodes.

765
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,240
It's inoperable,

766
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,170
but there are
radiation treatments
available.

767
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,440
They might give you
a few more months.

768
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,080

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,560
So was he.

773
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,270
He said, <i>"C'est la vie."</i>

774
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,640
He's a complicated man.

775
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,300
What about you?

776
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,580
What are you gonna do
about your problem?

777
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,620
Nothing. Just got a call
from my lawyer.

778
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,880
He gave the DA copies
of my prescriptions.

779
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,650
Soon as they confirm
they're bona fides,

780
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,590
they're gonna drop
the possession,
DUI and resisting arrest.

781
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,780
Soon as I pay
my $85 speeding ticket

782
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,590
and the impound fine,
I get my bike back.

783
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,860
I guess that's good.

784
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,860
You guess?
No, it's good.

785
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,730
You get to keep going
like you always have.

786
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,370
All right, I give up.
Who was it?

787
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,340
Who in your family
had the weight problem?

788
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,810
You think I can only care
about a patient

789
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,900
if I know someone else
who's been through
the same thing?

790
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,310
You care for everybody.

791
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,640
You only lie
and stand up to Cuddy
for a few.

792
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,950
You lie for everybody
and only care about a few.

793
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,680
You're avoiding the question.

794
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,020
I like damaged people,
remember?

795
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,350
It explains everything I do.

796
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,690
Almost everything.

797
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,030
It wasn't you, was it?

798
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,920
Does it matter?

799
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,260
Nope, but it'd be interesting.

800
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,490
Sorry to disappoint you,

801
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,770
but sometimes the answers
just aren't that simple.

802
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,780
I know he can be a real ass,

803
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,140
and he has no problem lying
when it serves him,

804
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,810
but he's not lying
about the pain.

805
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,110
He needs the medication,
which is why
I prescribed it.

806
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,210
All of it.

807
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,520
Well, I see a lot of cases

808
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,730
where people who have
real injuries
end up getting addicted.

809
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,170
And then, well, things kind of
spiral out of control.

810
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,460
And lives get ruined,
and not just their own.

811
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,410
I don't know what else
to tell you.

812
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,650
What about these?

813
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,380
This is getting...

814
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,860
If it's got my name on it,
it's a legit scrip.

815
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,420
You sure?
Yeah.

816
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,300
Because the signatures
on these

817
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,730
look a little different
than the signatures on those.

818
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,400
You look surprised.

819
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,040
No, I'm just...

820
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,280
I hadn't thought about it.
I do sign my name
differently sometimes.

821
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,450
Are you sure?
Yeah.

822
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,790
I just, I guess get bored
signing it the same way.

823
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,800
You know what they say
about doctors' handwriting.

824
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,590
I'm gonna give you a moment

825
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,860
to reconsider that answer.

826
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,570
Because if you are,
for some reason, mistaken,

827
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,850
we will find out,
and that will not be good
for you.

829
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,810
I am sure. Absolutely.

830
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,790
All right.

831
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,430
I guess that's it, then.

832
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,000
