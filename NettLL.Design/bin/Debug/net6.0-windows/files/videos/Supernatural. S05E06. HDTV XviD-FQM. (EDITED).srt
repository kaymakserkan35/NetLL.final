1
00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:03,318
You chose a demon
over your own brother,

2
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:04,986
and look what happened.

3
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:08,857
I did it. I started the apocalypse,
and I set, Lucifer free.

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,024
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:12,360
I would give anything...
anything

6
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:13,962
to take it all back.

7
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:14,930
I know you would.

8
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:17,732
If we're gonna be a team,
you and I,

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,200
It has to be
a two-way street.

10
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:20,869
We got to just grab on
to whatever's in front of us,

11
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,004
Kick its ass,
and go down fighting.

12
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:24,573
I can get on board
with that.

13
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:26,574


14
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:29,110


15
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:31,780


16
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:38,019


17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,931


18
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:53,501


19
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:56,604


20
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:59,007


21
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:02,376


22
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:08,449


23
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:09,751


24
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,720


25
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:13,521


26
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:15,056
Jimmy?

27
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:16,891


28
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,237


29
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:30,872
I told you
to go to bed.

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,608
I can't. I'm dead.

31
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,977
What is this..?
ketchup?

32
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:37,612
Gross!

33
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:39,781
Ow! you're mean.

34
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,883
Yeah, that's what your parents
pay me for... to be mean.

35
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:43,017
Bed... now!

36
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:44,418
Okay, okay.

37
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:46,420
Just wait. wait.

38
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:49,057
I'll go to bed
if you let me touch your boob.

39
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,191
Oh! go!

40
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,232


41
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,699


42
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:06,107


43
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:07,742


44
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,577


45
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,512


46
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:16,484


47
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,798


48
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,810


49
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:44,078
I'll, uh,
take, Amber home.

50
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:45,513
Don't wait up.

51
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,521
Amber.

52
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:56,124
Amber.

53
00:02:57,993 --> 00:02:59,593
Amber?

54
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,910
Francine!

55
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:19,914


56
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,853
Agents, Page and Plant,
FBI.

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,888
Gentlemen, what brings you by?

58
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:31,023
We need to see
Amber Greer's body.

59
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,125
Really? what for?

60
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:37,196
The police report said something
clawed through her skull?

61
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,498
You didn't read
the autopsy report

62
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,700
That I, e-mailed out
this morning?

63
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,936
W-we had, uh,
server issues.

64
00:03:57,784 --> 00:03:59,485
When they brought her in,

65
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:02,021
We thought she was attacked
by a wolf or something.

66
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:03,189
Or something.

67
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:05,391
But we were wrong.

68
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:08,560
Is that a...

69
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,296
It's a press-on nail.

70
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:12,564
We found it
in her temporal lobe.

71
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,100
is that even possible?

72
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,135
wait, are you... you saying
that she did this to herself?

73
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:18,437
Uh-huh. She scratched
her brains out.

74
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:21,507
It'd take hours,
and it'd hurt like hell,

75
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:23,442
But sure... it's possible.

76
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,476
How?

77
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,079
Pick your acronym...
OCD, PCP.

78
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:28,948
It all spells, "crazy."

79
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:31,984
My guess...
some kind of phantom itch.

80
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:34,553
I mean, an extreme case, but...

81
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:35,955
Phantom itch?

82
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,089
Yeah.

83
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:42,361
All it takes is someone
talking about an itch...

84
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:43,963
or thinking about one, even

85
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,531
and suddenly you can't stop scratching.

86
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:46,598
Thanks, doc.

87
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,267
Okay.

88
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:55,541
Okay, now, some of these
questions might seem a bit odd,

89
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:58,377
but please
just bear with me.

90
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:00,612
Have you noticed
any cold spots in the house?

91
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,249
Uh... no.

92
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:06,485
Okay, uh,
what about strange smells?

93
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,254
Whatcha lookin' for?

94
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,158
Don't know yet.

95
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:17,096
It's, uh... Jimmy, right?

96
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,367
So, Amber was
your babysitter?

97
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:23,035
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,838
Yeah, most of
my babysitters sucked,

99
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,373
especially Ms. Chancey.

100
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:29,075
She only cared
about two things...

101
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:31,777
"dynasty" and bedtime.

102
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,212


103
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:37,116
Did you, uh, you see
anything strange that night?

104
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:38,851
No, sir.

105
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:41,587
You sure about that?

106
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:44,823
I-I would tell you
if I knew something.

107
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,725
I promise... 100%.

108
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:47,860
Cross my heart.

109
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:52,064
Well, Jimmy, I, uh...

110
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,001
...I happen to know
you're lying.

111
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:56,502
I'm not.

112
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:01,307


113
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:05,277
We gonna start talking truth,

114
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:07,679
or are you and me gonna have to
take a little trip downtown?

115
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:13,219
Kid said he put this
on the babysitters hairbrush.

116
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:14,786
Dean, there's no way
itching powder

117
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:16,489
made that girl
scratch her brains out.

118
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:17,990
It's just ground-up maple seeds.

119
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:19,892
If you have any other theories,
I'm open to 'em.

120
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,228


121
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:23,562


122
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,730
Yeah?

123
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,467
Yeah, we'll be right there.

124
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:36,942
Dr. Morris, please dial 1-1.

125
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,077
What happened?

126
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:39,578
Guy got electrocuted.

127
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:40,146
Any idea how?

128
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:41,914
Eh, maybe a loose wire

129
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:43,949
or a piece of equipment
shorted out.

130
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:45,918
So far, we haven't found anything.

131
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,119
Witnesses?

132
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:48,887
Yeah, guy in there,
Mr. Stanley.

133
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,389
He says he saw it,

134
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,258
but he's not making
a lick of sense.

135
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:53,392
Senile.

136
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,094
Thanks.

137
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:01,700
Um, Mr. Stanley?

138
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:03,369
It was just a joke.

139
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:06,939
I didn't know
it would really work.

140
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,006
What would work?

141
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:12,911
All I did,

142
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,147
was shake his hand.

143
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:32,598
You ready?

144
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,700
Hit it, Mr. Wizard.

145
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,041


146
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,680


147
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:54,519
That'll do, pig.

148
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:57,723
What the hell?

149
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:01,627
that crap isn't supposed to work.

150
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:04,429
This thing doesn't even have batteries.

151
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:05,897
So... so, what?

152
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,499
are... are we looking
at cursed objects?

153
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:08,934
Sounds good.

154
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:13,538
Maybe there's a powerful witch in town.

155
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:16,508


156
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,045
Is there any link
between the, uh,

157
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:22,781
The joy buzzer
and the itching powder?

158
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:25,884
Uh, one was made in, China,
the other, Mexico,

159
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:28,286
but they were both bought
from the same store.

160
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:29,354
Hmm.

161
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,229


162
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,834


163
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:43,869
Sam!

164
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:50,842


165
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,551
Welcome to the Conjurarium,

166
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:02,020
sanctum of magic and mystery.

167
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,989
You the owner?

168
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:06,024
Yep.

169
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:08,393
You sold any itching powder
or joy buzzers lately?

170
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,729
Yeah, a grand total of one of each.

171
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:13,131
They aren't exactly
big-ticket items.

172
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,300
Look, you boys here
to buy something

173
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,635
or... what?

174
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,237
So, you get
many customers?

175
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,239
Kids come in.

176
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:22,574
They don't buy much,

177
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,242
but they're more than happy
to break stuff.

178
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,279
These days, all they care about
are their, iPhones

179
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,315
and those, kissing-vampire movies.

180
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:31,783
The whole thing
makes me just...

181
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:32,684
Angry?

182
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,055
Yeah.
Yeah, I am angry.

183
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:40,458
This shop has been
my life for 20 years,

184
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,293
and now it's wasting
away to nothing.

185
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:43,394
Which is why
you hate them.

186
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:44,696
I suppose.

187
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:46,865
You wish there was something
you could do about it.

188
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,200
Yeah, I guess I do.

189
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,768
So you're taking revenge...

190
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:53,772
...with this.

191
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,406


192
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:56,208
Aah! no!

193
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,211
Oh!

194
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:01,847
Oh!

195
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:03,481
Oh.

196
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,317
<i>something tells me this guy
is not a powerful witch.</i>

197
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,585
Yeah.

198
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,221
Sorry.

199
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,255
Sorry.

200
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:13,458


201
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:16,764
I'll just slip this tooth
under your pillow,

202
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:19,032
and while you're asleep,

203
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,901
the tooth fairy will float down

204
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,669
and swap it out for a quarter.

205
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:25,939
So some freak is gonna come
in my room while I'm sleeping

206
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,207
and take my tooth?

207
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,209
Sounds scary.

208
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:31,611
No, thank you.

209
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,313
Come on.

210
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,692
Good night, sweetie.

211
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,907


212
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:31,205


213
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:33,307


214
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:36,977
Shh!

215
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:38,212
Hold still.

216
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,013
You might feel just a little...

217
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,481
Pinch.

218
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:43,150


219
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,235


220
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,772
Well, I, uh,
appreciate that,

221
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,941
Nurse... Fremont.

222
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,109
Please... call me "Jen."

223
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,177
Oh. "Jen" it is.

224
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:01,178


225
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,484
What's up with toothless?
cavity creeps get a hold of him?

226
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:08,953
Yeah. close.

227
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,155
He wrote up a description,

228
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:13,624
5'10", 350 pounds,

229
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,426
Wings, and a pink tutu.

230
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:17,061
Said it was
the tooth fairy.

231
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:18,896
So he's obviously
whacked out on painkillers.

232
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:20,297
Maybe.

233
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,200
<i>whatever it was got past
locked doors and windows</i>

234
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,769
Without triggering
the alarm.

235
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:26,437
Come on, the tooth fairy?

236
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:29,273
And it left 32 quarters
underneath his pillow,

237
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,407
one for each tooth.

238
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:35,079
Well, I will see your crazy
and raise you some.

239
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:37,281
There's a couple of kids
upstairs with stomach ulcers,

240
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:39,383
say they got it from
mixing pop rocks and coke.

241
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,151
Another guy...

242
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,920
his face froze that way.

243
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,089
What way?

244
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:56,033
He, uh, held it too long,
and it... it stuck.

245
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:57,702
They're flying in
a plastic surgeon.

246
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:01,472
So, I mean,
if you add all that up...

247
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,010
I got nothing.

248
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,014
I thought
sea-monkeys were real.

249
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,016
They are, they're brine shrimp.

250
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,651
No, no, no,
I mean like in the ads.

251
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:16,420
You know, like the sea-monkey
wife cooks the pot roast

252
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:18,022
for the sea-monkey husband,

253
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,190
and the sea-monkey kids
play with the dog

254
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,993
In a sea-monkey castle, real.

255
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,794
I mean, I was 6,
but I believed it.

256
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:24,996
Okay.

257
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:26,964
Point is...

258
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,066
maybe that's
the connection.

259
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,135
The tooth fairy,
the pop rocks and coke,

260
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:32,837
The joy buzzer
that shocks you,

261
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:34,672
they're all lies
that kids believe.

262
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,841
and now, they're coming true.

263
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,877
Okay, so whatever's doing this
is... is reshaping reality.

264
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,311
It has the powers
of a god.

265
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,948
Or... of a trickster.

266
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,017
Yeah, with the sense of
humor of a 9-year-old.

267
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:48,919
or you.

268
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:00,264
Dude, seriously...
still with the ham?

269
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:03,034
We don't have a fridge.

270
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:05,136
Well, I found something.

271
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:06,336
Here.

272
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:09,406
Um, tooth fairy attack was here,

273
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,908
pop rocks and coke was here,

274
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,744
then you've got itching powder,
face freeze, and joy buzzer...

275
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,412
All located within a 2-mile radius.

276
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,214
So, we got
a blast zone of weird,

277
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:19,116
and inside, fantasy becomes reality.

278
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:21,118
Looks like.

279
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:22,720
and what's the a-bomb at its center?

280
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:27,091
Four acres of farmland...
and a house.

281
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:31,328
Our motel isn't in that circle,
by any chance?

282
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,264
Yeah.

283
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,300
Why?

284
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:41,471
Oh, d-dude...

285
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:42,873


286
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:44,809
That's not what I think it is, is it?

287
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:46,376
I got bored,
that nurse was hot.

288
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:50,848
You know you can
go blind from that, too.

289
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,283
Give me five minutes.
we'll go check out that house.

290
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,218
Yeah.

291
00:14:56,454 --> 00:14:58,089
Hey, do not use my razor!

292
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,336


293
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:37,127
Can I help you?

294
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:39,630
Hi. uh, what's your name?

295
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:41,931
Who wants to know?

296
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:46,035
The, uh...

297
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:47,137
...FBI.

298
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:49,640
Let me see that.

299
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,977
So, what,
you guys don't knock?

300
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,380
Are your parents home?

301
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:57,881
They work.

302
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:00,016
Well, you mind
if we ask you a few questions,

303
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,018
Maybe take a look
around the house?

304
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,353
I don't know.

305
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,855
Come on.
you can trust us.

306
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,391
We're the authorities.

307
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:13,163


308
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,836
What's that?

309
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:21,171
It's called soup.

310
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:23,440
You heat it up,
and you eat it.

311
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,875


312
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,011
Right. I-I know.
it's just, um...

313
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:32,649
I used to make my own dinner,
too, when I was a kid.

314
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:33,817
Well, I'm not a kid.

315
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,053
Right. no, I-I know.

316
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,888
Um...

317
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,424
I'm, Robert, by the way.

318
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,591
Jesse.

319
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:44,260
Jesse, nice to meet you.

320
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:45,395
Did you draw this?

321
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,596
It's the tooth fairy.

322
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,234
That's what you think
the tooth fairy looks like, huh?

323
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,870
Yeah, my dad
told me about him.

324
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,305
Huh.

325
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:58,675
<i>what, didn't your dad tell you
about the tooth fairy?</i>

326
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,043
<i>my dad?</i>

327
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,678


328
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:03,847
My dad told me different stories.

329
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,682
Well, the tooth fairy isn't a story.

330
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,687
What do you know
about itching powder, Jesse?

331
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:12,456
That stuff will make you
scratch your brains out.

332
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,225
Pop rocks and coke?

333
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,260
You mix them, and you'll
end up in the hospital.

334
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,229
Everyone knows that.

335
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,667
You shouldn't have that.

336
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:24,634
Why not?

337
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:26,035
It can electrocute you.

338
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:29,406
<i>actually, it can't.</i>

339
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,641
It's just a wind-up toy.

340
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,310
It's totally harmless.

341
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:34,811
Doesn't even have batteries.

342
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,213
So, it can't shock you?

343
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:38,282
Nope, not at all.

344
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,383
I swear.

345
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:43,453
Oh.

346
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,788
Okay.

347
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,757
I mean, all it does
is just shake in your hand.

348
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:48,325
It's kind of lame.

349
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:49,393
See?

350
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,161


351
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:56,800
What did you say
your name was, again?

352
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,270
Dude, what the hell?

353
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:06,872
I had a hunch. I went with it.

354
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,774
- You risked my ass on a hunch?!
- You're fine.

355
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,177
Besides, now we know who's turning
this town into Willy Wonka's worst nightmare.

356
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:12,444
The kid.

357
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:14,914
Yeah, everything, Jesse
believes comes true.

358
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:16,716
He thinks the tooth fairy
looks like, Belushi,

359
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:17,750
Joy buzzers
really shock people.

360
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,318
Boom, that's what happens.

361
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,553
Yeah, but convince him the
joy buzzers don't actually work,

362
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,622
and they go from killing
machines back into crap toys.

363
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,825
He probably doesn't
even know he's doing it.

364
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,897
<i>how is he doing it?</i>

365
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:40,606


366
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:43,675
So, dug up what I
could on, Jesse Turner.

367
00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:45,077
It's not much.

368
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:48,513
Uh, "B" student,
won last year's, Pine-wood Derby.

369
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:50,249
But get this.

370
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:51,984
Jesse was adopted.

371
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:53,585
His birth records are sealed.

372
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:55,187
So you unsealed them, and...?

373
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,889
There's no father listed,

374
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:59,458
But, Jesse's biological mom
is named, Julia Wright.

375
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:02,194
She lives in, elk creek,
on the other side of the state.

376
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:07,967


377
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:28,353


378
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:30,923
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not interested.

379
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,524
Ohh, we're not salesmen.

380
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:34,827
Agents, Page and Plant, FBI.

381
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,100
Put your badge in the slot.

382
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:43,235
Your partner's, too.

383
00:19:49,742 --> 00:19:52,577


384
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:53,813


385
00:19:57,617 --> 00:19:58,684
What do you want?

386
00:19:58,751 --> 00:19:59,685
Thank you.

387
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:01,086
Um...

388
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:04,690
We just had a few questions...
about your son.

389
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:07,426
I don't have a son.

390
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:12,464
He was born, March
29, 1998, in, Omaha.

391
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:13,999
You put him
up for adoption?

392
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:18,270
What about him?

393
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:22,007
We were just wondering,
um, was it a...

394
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:25,344
...was it a normal pregnancy?

395
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:28,547
Was there anything strange?

396
00:20:28,614 --> 00:20:29,681
Stay away!

397
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:30,883
Mrs. Wright, wait!

398
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,890
We just want to talk!

399
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:44,029
You're not demons?

400
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:46,732
How do you know
about demons?

401
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:54,406
I was possessed.

402
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:59,811
A demon took control of
my body, and I hurt people,

403
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:02,781
I killed people.

404
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:04,449
That... that wasn't you.

405
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:06,451
But I was there.

406
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,388
I heard a woman
beg for mercy.

407
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:13,225
I... felt a young girl's blood
drip down my hands.

408
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,228
That's how you knew
about the salt.

409
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:19,331
Yeah, I picked up tricks.
it was in my head for months.

410
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:20,366
How many months?

411
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:21,934
Nine.

412
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,239
So your son...

413
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:29,775
Yeah... the whole time

414
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:32,611
the pregnancy, birth...

415
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:33,979
all of it.

416
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:36,949
I was possessed.

417
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:42,121
The night the baby
was born, I was alone.

418
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,225
and the pain was...
the pain was overwhelming.

419
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:50,329
I-I screamed, and
it came out a laugh...


420
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:52,965
because the demon was happy.

421
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:58,804
it used my body
to give birth to a child.

422
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,439


423
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:06,511
When it was over,
something changed

424
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,013
maybe the, the demon was tired

425
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:11,016
Or if the pain helped
me fight it, but...

426
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,185


427
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:15,487
...somehow, I took control,

428
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:16,588


429
00:22:16,656 --> 00:22:18,623
and the demon wailed inside me.

430
00:22:18,691 --> 00:22:20,659
It pounded
against my skull.

431
00:22:20,726 --> 00:22:23,528
I thought,
my head was gonna explode.

432
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:27,066
But... I knew.

433
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,601
I knew
what I had to do.

434
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:36,641


435
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:45,284
and when I was alone
with the baby...


436
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,286
a part of me...

437
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:49,521
Part of me
wanted to kill it.

438
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,561
But, god help me,
I couldn't do that.

439
00:22:56,629 --> 00:23:00,732
So... I put it
up for adoption...

440
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,368
and I ran.

441
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:05,104
Who was the father?

442
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,974
I was a virgin.

443
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:16,048
Have you seen my son?

444
00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:17,782
Is he human?

445
00:23:19,486 --> 00:23:21,653
His name's, Jesse.

446
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:25,124
He lives in, uh, Alliance.

447
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:27,192
He's a good kid.

448
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:31,230


449
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:33,565
so, now what?

450
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,401
We need help.

451
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:47,146
I take it you got our message.

452
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:48,580
It's lucky you found the boy.

453
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:51,183
Oh, yeah, real lucky.

454
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:52,384
What do we do with him?

455
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:53,385
Kill him.

456
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,557
Cass.

457
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:00,392
This child is half demon
and half human,

458
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,162
but it's far more powerful than either.

459
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:06,065
Other cultures call this hybrid
Cambion or Katako.

460
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:09,435
You know him
as the Anti-Christ.

461
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:12,371


462
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:16,775


463
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,747
That wasn't me.

464
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,085
Who put that there?

465
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:28,487
Anyway, I don't get it.

466
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:30,322
Jesse is the devil's son?

467
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,291
No, of course not.

468
00:24:32,358 --> 00:24:35,427
Your bible gets more
wrong than it does right.

469
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:37,629
The Antichrist
is not, Lucifer's child.

470
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:39,098
It's just a demon spawn.

471
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:42,201
but it is one of the devil's
greatest weapons

472
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:43,702
in the war against heaven.

473
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:45,036
Well if, Jesse's
a demonic howitzer,

474
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:46,638
then what the hell's
he doing in, Nebraska?

475
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:49,007
The demons lost him,
they can't find him

476
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:50,342
but they're looking.

477
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,810
and they lost him, because...?

478
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:53,512
Because of the child's power.

479
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,614
it hides him from
both angels and demons

480
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:57,682
for now.

481
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,185
So he's got, like,
a force field around him.

482
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:01,853
Well, that's great,
problem solved.

483
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:05,390
With, Lucifer risen,
this child grows strong.

484
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,825
Soon, he will do more

485
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:09,328
than just make a
few toys come to life.

486
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:12,631
Something that will
draw the demons to him.

487
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:15,100
the demons will find this child.

488
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:18,737
Lucifer will twist this boy to his purpose

489
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:20,739
and then, with a word,

490
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:24,243
this child will destroy
the host of heaven.

491
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,644
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. wait.

492
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:29,714
You're saying that... that
Jesse's gonna nuke the angels?

493
00:25:29,782 --> 00:25:32,184
We cannot allow that to happen.

494
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:36,588
Wait.

495
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,125
We're the good guys.

496
00:25:40,193 --> 00:25:41,960
We... we don't
just kill children.

497
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:46,431
A year ago,

498
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,169
You would have done whatever
it took to win this war.

499
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:51,436
Things change.

500
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:59,344
<i>Okay. hey, look, we are not
going to kill him, all right?</i>

501
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:02,447
But we can't leave, Jesse here
either, we know that.

502
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:03,848
So...

503
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:06,685
We take him to, Bobby's.
He'll know what to do.

504
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:08,086
You'll kidnap him?

505
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:10,922
What is going on
in this town,

506
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,525
It's what happens
when this thing is happy.

507
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:16,027
<i>you cannot imagine
what it will do if it's angry.</i>

508
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:19,898
Besides, how will you hold him?

509
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:21,833
With a thought, he could be
halfway around the world.

510
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,503
So we...

511
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:26,438
So we tell him the truth.

512
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:28,740
You say, Jesse's destined
to go dark side... fine.

513
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:30,275
But he hasn't yet.

514
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:31,943
So if we lay it all out for him...

515
00:26:32,011 --> 00:26:34,979
what he is, the apocalypse, everything...

516
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:36,715
He might make
the right choice.

517
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:44,656
<i>you didn't.</i>

518
00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:49,894
and I can't take
that chance.

519
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,339
damn it.

520
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:12,851


521
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:14,286
Oh.

522
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:15,920
Sorry, I'm sorry.

523
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:17,256
It's... it's no worries. you okay?

524
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:21,660
Yeah, it's just today...
a little... shaky.

525
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,429
Ah well, talking to the
Winchesters will do that to you.

526
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:27,198
Don't you recognize me, sweetheart?

527
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:28,533
huh?

528
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:31,336
we had some great times
together, didn't we?

529
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:34,640
and then you stole something
from us, hid it away.

530
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:37,709
That was very,
very naughty of you.

531
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:41,112
So we watched,
and we waited

532
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,748
and now...

533
00:27:42,815 --> 00:27:45,150
They told you where he is, didn't they?

534
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:48,320
I think it's time we go
and visit our son.

535
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,725


536
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:19,418


537
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:27,992
Don't be afraid.

538
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,861
I won't hurt you.

539
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:41,807
Mom! dad!

540
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:44,476
Your mother and father are sleeping.

541
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:47,245
I assure you, they won't
wake until morning.

542
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:55,987
I'm sorry.

543
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,897
Was there a guy here?

544
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:07,198
In a trench coat?

545
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:38,145
Was he your friend?

546
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:39,613
Him?

547
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:41,649
No.

548
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,419
<i>I did that.</i>

549
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:48,789
<i>but how did I do that?</i>

550
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,227
You're a superhero.

551
00:29:53,295 --> 00:29:54,861
I am?

552
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:56,897
Yeah.

553
00:29:56,964 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah. I mean, who else
could turn someone into a toy?

554
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:01,569
You're superman...

555
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:04,605
Minus the cape
and the go-go boots.

556
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,810
See, my... my partner and I,

557
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,546
We work for a secret
government agency.

558
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:16,250
It's our job to find kids
with special powers.

559
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:18,285
In fact, we're here to take you

560
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:21,555
to a hidden base
in, South Dakota,

561
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:23,524
Where you'll be trained to fight evil.

562
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:24,491
Like the, X-Men?

563
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,827
Exactly like the, X-Men.

564
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:28,061


565
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:29,963
In fact, the, uh, guy
we're taking you to...

566
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:31,798
He's even in a wheelchair.

567
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,567
You'll be a hero.

568
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:35,836
You'll save lives,
you'll get the girl.

569
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:37,204
Sounds like fun, right?

570
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:42,943
They're lying to you.

571
00:30:47,115 --> 00:30:48,515
Stay right there, dreamboat.

572
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,650
Can't hurt you.

573
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:51,852
Orders.

574
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,153
You, on the other hand?

575
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,223
Hurting you's encouraged.

576
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:02,463
Leave them alone!

577
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:05,966
Jesse.

578
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,569
You're beautiful.

579
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:11,104
You have your father's eyes.

580
00:31:11,172 --> 00:31:12,906
Who are you?

581
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:14,408
I'm your mother.

582
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:15,842
No, you're not.

583
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,810
Mm-hmm.

584
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:19,446
You're half human...

585
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:21,214
Half one of us.

586
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:22,716
<i>she means demons, Jesse!</i>

587
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:30,658
Those people you call your parents,

588
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:31,925
they lied to you, too.

589
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:34,495
You're not theirs... not really.

590
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,530
My mom and dad love me.

591
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:37,864
Do they?

592
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:40,133
Is... is that why they
leave you alone all day?

593
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:41,735
<i>because they love you
so much?</i>

594
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:44,938
<i>these people...
these imposter's...</i>

595
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:47,608
They told you that the
tooth fairy was real

596
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:49,042
and that your toys could hurt you

597
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,811
and a hundred other
things that aren't true.

598
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:53,781
<i>they love you so much,
they made your whole life a lie.</i>

599
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:58,585
Look into your heart, Jesse.

600
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:00,253
You've always known
you weren't theirs.

601
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:03,056
You've always known
you were different

602
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:05,592
everyone has lied to you.

603
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,827
They're not, FBI agents,

604
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:11,898
and you're not a superhero.

605
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:14,134
Then what am I?

606
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:15,302
You're powerful.

607
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,237
You can have
anything you want.

608
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:19,373
<i>you can do
anything you want.</i>

609
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:20,874
Don't listen to her, Jesse!

610
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:22,976
They treated you
like a child.

611
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:25,479
Nobody trusted you,
everybody's lied to you.

612
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:26,747
doesn't that make you angry?

613
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:33,987


614
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,928
<i>See? it does make you angry.</i>

615
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:45,799
But, I'm telling you
the truth, Jesse.

616
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,835
Wouldn't it be better
if there were no lies?

617
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:50,437
Come with me...

618
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:53,006
and you can
wash it all clean.

619
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,475
Start over.

620
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:55,976
Imagine that...

621
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:58,178
A world without lies.

622
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:05,018
She's right,
we lied to you.

623
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,320
but I'll tell you the truth.

624
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:08,355


625
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,826
I just went... to tell...

626
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:15,462
Stop it.

627
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,898
I want to hear
what he has to say.

628
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:22,403
You're stronger
than I thought.

629
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,237


630
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,673
We lied to you.

631
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:28,742
and I'm sorry.

632
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,076
So here's the truth.

633
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:33,614
I'm, Sam Winchester.

634
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,816
That's my brother, Dean.

635
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:37,851
W-we hunt monsters.

636
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,787
<i>except when you are the monster.</i>

637
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:41,021
Right, Sammy?

638
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:42,523
And that woman right there,
her name is, Julia.

639
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:45,559
She's your mother.

640
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:48,429
But the thing inside of her,

641
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:50,631
The thing that you're talking to...

642
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:53,099
- It's a demon.
- A demon?

643
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:55,235
He's done nothing but lie to you
since the moment you met him.

644
00:33:55,303 --> 00:33:56,770
Don't listen to him.

645
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:57,971
Punish him.

646
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,205
Sit down and shut up.

647
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,149
There's, uh, kind of a...

648
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,351
a war between, angels and demons

649
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:14,020
and... you're a part of it.

650
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:16,590
I'm just a kid.

651
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:19,526
You can go with her
if you want.

652
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:21,428
I can't stop you, no one can.

653
00:34:21,496 --> 00:34:24,197
But if you do...

654
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:26,166
Millions of people will die.

655
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,702
She said I was half demon.
is that true?

656
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,804
Yes.

657
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:33,006
But you're half human, too.

658
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,108
You can do
the right thing.

659
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:37,177
You've got choices, Jesse.

660
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,712
But if you make
the wrong ones,

661
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,147
It'll haunt you
for the rest of your life.

662
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:44,417
why are you telling me this?!

663
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:47,588
<i>because I have to believe someone
can make the right choice,</i>

664
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:49,723
<i>even if I couldn't.</i>

665
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,399
Get out of her.

666
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,001


667
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:11,645


668
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:16,650
How did you do that?

669
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,819
I just did.

670
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:20,020
Kid...

671
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:23,223
...you're awesome.

672
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:25,559
Ahh.

673
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:32,134
Is she gonna be all right?

674
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,439
Eventually.

675
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,347


676
00:35:48,218 --> 00:35:50,686
Look, uh, truth is,

677
00:35:50,754 --> 00:35:53,589
He's kind of a buddy of mine.

678
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:55,758
Is there any way
you could turn him back?

679
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:57,059
He tried to kill me.

680
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:00,530
Right, uh...

681
00:36:00,597 --> 00:36:02,565
But he's a... he's a good guy.

682
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:03,766
He was just confused.

683
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:09,405
Okay.

684
00:36:09,472 --> 00:36:12,141
It's been a long night.
we'll... talk about it later.

685
00:36:15,412 --> 00:36:16,311
What now?

686
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:23,318
Now we take you
someplace safe,

687
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:25,888
Get you trained up.

688
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:28,157
You'd be handy
in a fight, kid.

689
00:36:28,224 --> 00:36:29,458
<i>what if I don't want to fight?</i>

690
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:31,661
Jesse.

691
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:37,633


692
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:40,469
You're powerful.

693
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:43,906
More powerful than...

694
00:36:43,974 --> 00:36:46,475
Pretty much anything we've ever seen.

695
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:48,110
- That makes you...
- A freak.

696
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:54,516
To some people, maybe

697
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,518
<i>but not to us.</i>

698
00:36:56,587 --> 00:36:58,520
See, we're kind of freaks ourselves.

699
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,892
I can't stay here, can I?

700
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,560
No.

701
00:37:04,628 --> 00:37:06,996
The demons know where you are,
and more will be coming.

702
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:14,003
I won't go without my
mom and dad.

703
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:17,907
There's nothing more
important than family.

704
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:19,508
We get that

705
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:21,477
and if you really want
to take them with you,

706
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:23,412
We'll back your play.

707
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,314
But you got to understand...

708
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:27,449
<i>it's gonna be dangerous for them, too.</i>

709
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:28,985
What do you mean?

710
00:37:29,052 --> 00:37:31,020
Our dad...

711
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:33,155
He would take us with him
wherever he went.

712
00:37:33,223 --> 00:37:35,190
- Where is he now?
- Dead.

713
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:38,193
A demon killed him.

714
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:41,163
Look, Jesse...

715
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:43,398
Once you're in this fight...

716
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:48,537
...you're in it till the end,

717
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:50,006
Win or lose.

718
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,308
What should I do?

719
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:54,610
We can't tell you.

720
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:56,445
It's your choice.

721
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:59,248
It's not fair, I know.

722
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:04,020
Can I go see my parents?

723
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:07,023
I, um...

724
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,759
I need to... say goodbye.

725
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:13,562
Sure.

726
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:20,329
He's been up there
a long time.

727
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,456
He's gone.

728
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:33,792
Where?

729
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,761
I don't know.

730
00:39:35,828 --> 00:39:37,997
Jesse put everyone in
town back to normal...

731
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:40,065
the ones still alive.

732
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:41,833
then he vanished.

733
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:46,605
Hey.

734
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:52,411
What does it say?

735
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,552
That he had to leave
to keep his parents safe,

736
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,788
That he loves them,
and he's sorry.

737
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:07,592
How do we find him?

738
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,995
With the boy's powers, we can't.

739
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:11,730
<i>not unless he wants to be found.</i>

740
00:40:18,204 --> 00:40:20,339
You think, Jesse's gonna be okay?

741
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:21,673


742
00:40:21,741 --> 00:40:22,975
I hope so.

743
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:26,645


744
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:28,647
You know, we destroyed that kid's life

745
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:29,915
by telling him the truth.

746
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,386
We didn't have a choice, Dean.

747
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:38,257
Yeah.

748
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:39,959
You know, I'm starting to get

749
00:40:40,026 --> 00:40:42,027
why parents lie to their kids

750
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:45,931
you want them to believe
that the worst thing out there

751
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:48,300
Is mixing pop rocks and coke...

752
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:50,502
<i>protect them from the real evil.</i>

753
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:54,206
You want them going
to bed feeling safe.

754
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:56,375
If that means lying
to them, so be it.

755
00:41:01,348 --> 00:41:04,383
The more I think about it...

756
00:41:04,451 --> 00:41:06,452
<i>the more I wish
dad had lied to us.</i>

757
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:10,055
Yeah, me too.
