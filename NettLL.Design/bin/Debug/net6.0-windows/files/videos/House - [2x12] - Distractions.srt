1
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,974
AII right, hold on.
I got the turn up here.

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,541
(WHOOPING)

3
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,743
Oh! How cool was that?

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,651
That was way cool!

5
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,759
My turn. Sorry, that's
not allowed.

6
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,694
I just signed
15 pages of forms saying

7
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,859
you gotta ride
on the back of that thing.
I don't see
any Iawyers around.

8
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,925
You know
that's not the point.
No.

9
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,938
You just wanna keep
all the fun to yourself.

10
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,464
Come on, Dad!

11
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,044
You go over 15,
we're pulling over, all right?
I mean it.

12
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,410
You're the best.
AII right, get on there.

13
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,574
Put on your goggles.
Okay.

14
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,543
Ready?
Got the clutch in?

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,645
AII right, that's my boy.

16
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,552
(WHOOPING)

17
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,235
Adam, you're going too fast,
slow it down!

18
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,367
I mean it,
you're going too fast.
SIow down!

19
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,707
Adam!

20
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,110
Adam!

21
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,654
Let go of the throttle!

22
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,019
Adam!

23
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,192
Adam! No!

24
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,689
PARAMEDIC: What've you got?
Sixteen-year-old, status post,

25
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,632
ATV crash,
40% burns on his body.

26
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,136
Nasotracheal intubation.

27
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,933
Start a bag
of Iactated Ringer's,
wide open...

28
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,201
Will he be okay?
We'II be with you when we can.

29
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,674
Get him out!

30
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,670
Wait, wait, wait!

31
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,006
NURSE: I'II start fluids.
Let's go get him hooked up.

32
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,375
SURGEON: Watch the Iine.

33
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,720
(READING HINDI)

34
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,937
Been Iooking for you.
Been avoiding you.

35
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,300
Burn Unit can handle it.

36
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,936
If they could handle it,
they wouldn't
be asking for you.

37
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,043
Is that a journal?
Friend wrote an article.

38
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,276
In Hindi?

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,581
They have a cutting-edge
neuroscience program in India.

40
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,884
It says so right on the cover.

41
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,853
Kid's heart rate's messed.

42
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,295
Tachycardia
can be explained by the burn.

43
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,798
I assume
the Burn Unit knew that.

44
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,831
His potassium's Iow.

45
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,838
Which can also be explained
by the burn.

46
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,431
Except I'm sure
the Burn Unit's
pumping him with fluids

47
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,103
which means his potassium
should be going up, not down.

48
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,736
Could be amphetamines.

49
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,678
Or bacteria
Iunching on his heart.

50
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,081
Or cardiomyopathy,
or some other very bad thing.

51
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,779
HOUSE: He needs an EKG.

52
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,045
(EXCLAIMING)

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,888
Okay, no skin, no EKG.

54
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,398
CHASE: Is he even
gonna survive the burn?

55
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,693
What, you got
a date or something?

56
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,363
Forty percent of his body.

57
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,906
If the Burns Unit
can prevent an infection,

58
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,033
his body will regenerate
maybe 10%,

59
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,873
surgeons will do
20 or so grafts,
six months in this room,

60
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,506
he'II end up
with a series of nasty scars,
maybe some pain,

61
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,981
but he'II Iive.

62
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,983
Unless his heart shuts down

63
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:17,648
'cause we can't figure out
what's causing the
Iow potassium and tachycardia.

64
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,859
We need help
from a Belgian doc
named Einthoven.

65
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,259
He's dead.

66
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,197
While he was alive,
he invented a Iittle dittie
called the Galvanometer.

67
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,325
Where do we get one?

68
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,962
Go to any electronics store
that's been open
since before 1905.

69
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,099
There's a good chance
they've got one
in a corner in the basement.

70
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,844
BRENDA: We need
an audio-visual setup
for the Iecture hall.

71
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,846
What for?
For the Iecture.

72
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,405
What Iecture?
Dr. Weber's Iecture.

73
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,984
Who is Dr. Weber?
A neurologist, I think.

74
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,521
The memo was from you.

75
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,127
Where is my assistant?
She Ieft.

76
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,358
When?
Wednesday.

77
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,731
Seriously?
Well, the temp agency
sent someone,

78
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,064
but she got Iost.

79
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,628
Well, when she gets here,
fire her.

80
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,887
Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,691
Did you issue this memo?
Look at that.

82
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,930
Congratulations.

83
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,299
The patient
that has been in a coma
for two years and counting

84
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,701
is still in a coma.

85
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,500
This is not my signature.

86
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,165
I don't know
anything about this guy.

87
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,108
I'm supposed to introduce him?
Have Iunch?

88
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,780
The coma patient
has a migraine?
Oh, no, no, no.

89
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,181
No, I gave him medication
to prevent a migraine.

90
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,718
That's a migraine.

91
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,084
Increased flow velocity
in his cerebral arteries.

92
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,817
I did subsequently
give him nitroglycerin,
which could possibly...

93
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:03,021
You induced
a migraine headache
in a coma patient?

94
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,759
I gave him a Iittle headache,
similar to the one
you're giving me now.

95
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,393
Have you even read
an ethical guideline?

96
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,438
Well, it would be wrong
to try out a new
migraine prevention medication

97
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,735
on someone
who can actually feel pain.

98
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,901
Did you sign this?
Yeah.

99
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,712
We can talk Iater about
the appropriate discipline.

100
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,277
CAMERON: Because of the burn,

101
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,821
we can't perform
any of our normal tests
to see what's wrong.

102
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,483
So we're going to try
a Galvanometer.

103
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,322
It picks up a pulse
in the wrists and the ankles.

104
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,859
Hopefully it'II tell us
why his heart rhythm
is abnormal.

105
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,197
What have I done to him? I...
It was an accident.

106
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,495
AII right? So...

107
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,770
He's got all these burns

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,035
and now
there's something wrong
with his heart?

109
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,873
We're trying to figure out
if the two
are somehow connected.

110
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,937
Had he been sick Iately?
No, nothing.

111
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,642
Anything unusual
with his behavior?

112
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,412
Had he been tired a Iot?
Nothing.

113
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:03,615
He was great, he was happy,
he was just having
a great time, and then...

114
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,318
If he was experimenting
with amphetamines
or cocaine...

115
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,451
No.

116
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,825
We gave him some pot
about a year ago, to try...

117
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,422
It was just once.

118
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,059
We thought
if we took the mystery
out of drugs and alcohol,

119
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,466
the Iess he'd experiment.

120
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,869
We'II know more
after the tests.

121
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,709
It Iooks Iike
they're gonna electrocute him.

122
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,311
PIug it in.

123
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,339
You plug it in.

124
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,884
Fine. Give me the cord.

125
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,020
Works.

126
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,896
Prominent U waves.

127
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,865
No inverted T wave.
No ischemia.

128
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,694
Q wave normal.

129
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,230
That's not good.

130
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,274
Okay, turn it off.
Turn it off!

131
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,278
What's happening?
What is that?

132
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,574
CHASE: The seizure's
getting...

133
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,410
Can't you stop that?

134
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,686
Who electrocuted my patient?

135
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,691
He had a seizure.
CAMERON: He wasn't
electrocuted.

136
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,421
What does the seizure tell us?
Move.

137
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,724
What are you Iooking for?

138
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,563
Same as you are, Iove,
acceptance,
solid return on an investment.

139
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,226
Differential diagnosis. Go.

140
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,202
Could be epilepsy
or seizure disorder.

141
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,638
Not with the tachycardia.
It could be
a virus in his brain.

142
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,006
Your specificity's impressive.

143
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,601
Adrenoleukodystrophy.

144
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,975
Could be MS.

145
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,708
The seizures could be caused
by plaques
and Iesions on the brain.

146
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,410
Well, Iet's find out which.
Get him an MRI.

147
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,248
No nuclear imaging!

148
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:47,322
He wouldn't survive
the move to Radiology.
MRI and CT scan are both out.

149
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,624
Okay, Iumbar puncture
will tell us
if his proteins are elevated,

150
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,027
at Ieast we can exclude MS.

151
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,132
We can't do
a Iumbar puncture either.

152
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,860
You're cramping my exits.

153
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,768
Don't tell me,
no skin on his spine.

154
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,774
We'd be inserting a needle
into an area
that's teeming with bacteria.

155
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,675
If he doesn't have
a brain infection already,
we'd give him one for sure.

156
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,475
There's no other way
to Iook at a brain.

157
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,612
Transcranial
Doppler Sonography.

158
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,847
She said "brain,"
not "pregnant woman's uterus."

159
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,685
They do sound alike.
I used one to Iook at a brain
this morning.

160
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,419
Why didn't you take
the patient to Radiology,
get an MRA?

161
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,586
Obviously
I was doing something illegal.

162
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,926
Using nuclear imaging
would have raised questions.

163
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,795
You're not gonna get
a diagnosis of MS
from a sonogram.

164
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,926
Not definitively,
but patients with MS

165
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,096
have more reactive neurons
in their occipital cortex.

166
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,240
Okay then.

167
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,282
Thank you for all coming
to today's Iecture

168
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,409
by Dr. Phillip Weber,

169
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,480
who is our guest today
at our hospital

170
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:53,082
to talk about headaches.

171
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,957
Dr. Weber is at
the Weber Center for Pain,
that makes sense.

172
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,162
Weber, Weber.
So please welcome Dr. Weber!

173
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,668
Thank you Dr. Cuddy.

174
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,744
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

175
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,610
I suppose I should tell you
a Iittle bit more
about myself.

176
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,682
I went to school in Virginia.

177
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,678
You've never been
to one of these things
in your Iife.

178
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,281
Who is this guy?
No idea.

179
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,527
What's with the outfit?

180
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,760
Sudden chills
and Iight sensitivity.

181
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,632
Inexplicable.

182
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,063
I received my medical degree
at Johns Hopkins University,

183
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,440
where I studied under
Brightman and Gilmar...

184
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,338
Hmm. He must be good.

185
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,436
You went to Hopkins,
and studied
under Brightman and Gilmar.

186
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,912
Shh.

187
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,382
...helped me win
the Doyle Internship
at the Mayo CIinic.

188
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,443
You were supposed
to get the Doyle Internship.

189
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,485
This guy's Von Lieberman?
The guy who got you
thrown out for cheating?

190
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,291
The dean threw me out.
Von Lieberman
just ratted on me.

191
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,594
This guy's name is Weber,
not Von Lieberman.

192
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,864
I call Weber Von Lieberman,
way eviler.

193
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,393
Shh.

194
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,535
...1 D receptors have improved
the acute treatment
of migraines,

195
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,969
to this point...

196
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,604
So what's the plan?

197
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,242
You gonna wait
until he bends over
and make a fart sound?

198
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,386
I'm not here about the past.
He's a bad scientist.

199
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,424
Well, you cheated off him,
how bad can he be?

200
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,862
He got the answer wrong.

201
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,298
DOUG: Are they trying
to wake him up?

202
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,602
They can't do that, right?
He'II be in too much pain.

203
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,972
Don't worry, he's still under.

204
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,308
But the brain
never completely sleeps,
it's always working.

205
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,872
Controlling your heart rate,
breathing, temperature.

206
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,076
The eyes
respond to visual stimuli.

207
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,121
BIood flow increases
in certain areas of the brain

208
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,680
and we can track that
with a sonogram.

209
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:10,218
With MS, blood vessels
are more reactive,
so flow is faster.

210
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,488
If Adam has an infection,

211
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,099
there'd be swelling,
which would
constrict the arteries.

212
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,397
And the flow would be slower.

213
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,303
Chase.
Near the subarachnoid space.

214
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,639
WEBER: Data from
control subjects were analyzed
of a two-way ANOVA

215
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,810
with status and side
as within-subject factors.

216
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,018
You stalked this guy
for 20 years just for
this shot to humiliate him?

217
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,059
I'm trying to Iearn.

218
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,459
...vessels without
significant rebound...

219
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,191
He doesn't even know
what that means.

220
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,732
You're gonna interrupt him,
aren't you?

221
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,425
If I have a question.

222
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,470
And what's that
gonna accomplish?

223
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,303
Why can't you just enjoy this?
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

224
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:59,708
You have got to find
Iess debilitating outlets
than humiliating people.

225
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,215
I hear bowling is more fun
than stalking.

226
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,306
But I'm better at this.

227
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,852
...if "P" is Iess than
point-zero...

228
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,411
BIow a ton of money
on a plasma TV.

229
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,054
We found a subarachnoid bleed.

230
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,862
BIeed in the head
isn't causing seizures.

231
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,229
It could be. 10% with damage
to cerebral cortex
have a seizure.

232
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,858
Or bacterial meningitis.

233
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,165
Viral encephalitis?
There's no way
to tell without...

234
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,465
Shut up!

235
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,072
Excuse me.

236
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,604
Not you.

237
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,340
You know, if my Iecture
is interrupting your meeting,
I can wait.

238
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,813
(SPEAKING HINDI)

239
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,342
As your people say in India.
Appreciate it.

240
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,981
We'II figure out why Iater.
Fix the bleed or he dies.

241
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,287
Talk to you in a couple hours.

I'm in the subarachnoid space.

244
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,041
Can you get it?
Think so.

245
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,406
Put the probe
back where it was
so I can see the wire!

246
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,575
We're Iooking for the bleed
in...

247
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,781
Look when I get there,
I'm flying blind
without a contrast CT here!

248
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:30,400
...and with a p-value
of Iess than 0.001,

249
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:35,105
we have strong statistical
evidence that this drug
prevents migraine headaches

250
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,540
without daily administration.

251
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,735
Excuse me, Doctor.

252
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,473
He knows his field
better than you do.

253
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,506
It's always been
my understanding that, unless
you follow a daily regimen,

254
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,609
no drug
can prevent a migraine.

255
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,586
That's why they call it
a breakthrough.

256
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,850
That's why
you call it a breakthrough.

257
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,223
No, the pharmaceutical company
sponsoring my clinical trials

258
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,524
also hails it
as a breakthrough.

259
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,224
I'm sure your wife
and Iawyer do, too.

260
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,765
Is there anybody
who doesn't stand
to make a fortune from it

261
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,303
calling it a breakthrough?

262
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,531
Who are you?

263
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,096
Just a Iunatic
who desperately needs a hobby.

264
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,165
How exactly
do these studies work?

265
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,177
Do you give this drug
to a bunch of people,

266
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,874
and if they don't
get a migraine, you go,
"Voila, my drug works"?

267
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,541
Excuse me, miss?

268
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,681
Do you have cancer?

269
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,223
Wow! Mango juice
prevents cancer.

270
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,888
Perhaps I should have
taken my medication
before this Iecture.

271
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:35,397
WEBER: We had
a very specific control group,
chronic migraine sufferers.

272
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,594
I don't have time
to go through
all the math right now,

273
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,128
but the incidence
was dramatically...
Sure, in India.

274
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,402
Two plus two
equals five there, right?

275

You sound very familiar.

279
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,020
Why did you publish it
in an obscure journal
in India?

280
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,583
Why not publish it
in really, really cool
head cases of South Philly?

281
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,356

is a respected journal.

282
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,093
Yeah.
The guy running SIurp N' Gulp
tells me it's one of the best.

00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,101
Get a hooker, anything.

284
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,764
See, I'm thinking
that publishing studies
is probably the easiest way

285
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,467
to get
a pharmaceutical company
to give you a reach-around.

286
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,636
And choosing a journal
that no one can actually read,
well, that's...

287
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,906
That's shrewd.

288
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,746

You took shortcuts
in med school,
you're taking shortcuts now.

304
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,063
You cannot test this

00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,520
Moving around is a bad idea.

340
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,557
Hey, if you feel chest pain,
you need to Iet me know.

341
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,566
Verapamil can cause
congestive heart failure.

342
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,726
Nothing can hurt my heart.

343
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,173
Hey, you're gonna feel
some dizziness. Definitely
gonna be constipated.

344
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,582
Differential diagnosis
for getting off.

345
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,753
Is he gonna be okay?
No. Something's
seriously wrong with him.

346
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:02,385
Differential diagnosis
for ejaculation.

347
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,390
Don't make me say it again.

348
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,626
We're not stalling,
we just don't know.

349
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,065
Then guess.

350
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,667
Could pain medication
cause an orgasm?
I wish.

351
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,707
Maybe pain caused the orgasm.

352
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,210
You get a tattoo,
the brain releases endorphins
which create pleasure.

353
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,838
Most people don't orgasm
from a needle prick.

354
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,778
HOUSE: Well,
Chase has a point.

355
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,546
The brain
is Iike a huge train station,

(GROANING)

357
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,824
You're the neurologist,
talk for me.

358
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,987
If sensory information
got misinterpreted by
the medial forebrain bundle,

359
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,997
it's possible
for bad to feel good,
and good to feel bad.

360
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,728
He's a Iucky kid.
Let's not fix him
until the burns heal.

361
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,861
So what attacks
the medial forebrain bundle?

362
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,201
Infective neuropathies,
vasculitic neuropathies...

363
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,400
Krabbe's disease,
metachromatic Ieukodystrophy.

364
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,205
HOUSE: AII very bad things.

365
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,906
No way to Iook for any of them
in his condition.

366
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,346
Could be an infection.

367
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,077
I said infection
about eight seconds ago.

368
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,119
You Iisted
some brain infections.

369
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:05,680
But what if it's just
a regular old infection
festering in the burned skin?

370
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,282
Pus on his arm
isn't causing problems
in the forebrain.

371
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,921
He's on
20 different medications
to manage his pain, his heart,

372
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,658
how often he urinates.

373
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,360
His brain is Iike a waiter
that's got too many...

374
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,165
Hey, hey. I do the metaphors.

375
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,798
The brain is stressed.

376
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,069
An infection elsewhere
could put it over the edge.

377
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,237
So we just wait
for his burns to heal
to see if you're right?

378
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,578
If you're wrong,
he doesn't have
that kind of time.

379
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,576
Dominic Larrey.

380
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,479
He another dead doctor?

381
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,218
He's Napoleon's
Surgeon in Chief.

382
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,850
CIeaned
a Iot of battle wounds.

383
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,326
By amputating Iegs.

384
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,056
And with bugs.

385
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:53,032
CAMERON: Maggots are implanted
directly into Adam's burns.

386
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,864
Maggots, they eat dead people,
I...

387
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,400
Maggots eat dead flesh.
Only dead flesh.

388
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,881
So they're perfectly suited
to clean wounds.

389
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,117
They also kill the bacteria
that thrive
in injured tissues.

They found a half-eaten sheep
in the zoo. The police
wanna ask you a few questions.

393
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,588
I need something
to wash it down.

394
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,723
Coffee? Bad idea.

395
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,894
You're better off with water!
Coffee's closer.

396
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,771
Foolproof plan, by the way.

397
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,637
Either his meds would work,

398
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:08,338
and you'd be in psychic pain
because Von Evil
is gonna be rich.

399
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:13,078
Or they wouldn't,
and you get
to be in agony all day.

400
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,188
Perfect Iose-Iose situation.
Very you.

401
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,088
I had to prove...
You've proved nothing.

402
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,461
Right. This isn't a migraine.

403
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,391
Yeah. "Dear New England

"Thus, scientifically proving

is an idiot."

406
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,304
You just wanted the pain.

407
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,866
Meds are supposed
to prevent migraine.

408
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,572
You get distracted by pain.

409
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,410
Leaves Iess room
for the things
you don't wanna think about.

410
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,782
Like the FIyers sucking,
or the price of gas,

411
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,316
or the fact that you pushed
the Iove of your Iife
out of your Iife.

412
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,187
God, I wish the pain
would go away.

413
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,359
Next time you need
to get your mind off her,
stick a needle in your eye.

414
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,229
It's Iess annoying
to the rest of us
when you can still walk.

417
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,539
Do you want a pillow?

Not softer, Iower.

You should've been better
by now.

421
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,813
I'm super.

422
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,522
Patient?

423
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,551
The maggots
did great for the burn.

424
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,990
But the brain waves
are still all over the map.

425
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:38,297
Which means your regular
old infection isn't causing
his brain dysfunction.

426
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,235
Which means there's
an underlying condition,

427
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,035
which means
we've gotta get
inside his head.

428
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,905
Do a Iumbar puncture.

429
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,206
We've already established
that we can't get a Iumbar...

No. No. No way.

I only saw
a cervical tap once,
and that guy got paralyzed.

433

Ask the parents if they prefer
to have their son
in a wheelchair or dead.

434
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,297
Something's causing his brain
to Iose control.

00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,265
Eventually it'II shut off.

436
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,858
We need to do
a Iumbar puncture

437
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,803
to get some of the fluid
in his spine
so we can test it.

438
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,033
You need us to sign a consent?

439
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,836
I have to warn you.

440
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,901
There's a serious risk
of paralysis or death.

441
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,643
Are you saying
we shouldn't do this?

442
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,544
You have to do this.

443
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,482
Then why are you telling us
what can go wrong?

444
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,645
I just think
you should know...
Either you're cruel

or this clipboard is a way
for you to cover your ass,

This isn't his fault.

you keep telling me.

00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,281
House, you okay?
We've been waiting for you.

505
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,653
I'm hallucinating.

506
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,228
Hallucinations with migraines
are pretty uncommon.

507
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,266
What did you see?
I saw music.

508
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,640
Sensory deception
makes no sense.

509
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,710
You took something.

510
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,982
The kid's
fighting for his Iife.

511
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,509
Hey, you find him?

512
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,675
He was hallucinating
in the Iocker room.

513
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,150
He okay?

514
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,016
He's feeling no pain,
he's high.

515
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,385
Vicodin high?

516
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,050
Past that. He's seeing sounds.

517
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,883
Took something.

518
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,425
Why is it so dark in here?
It's a beautiful day outside.

519
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,127
Open the shades,
Iet the sun shine in.

520
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,760
It's nighttime.

521
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,574
It's still Tuesday, right?
You Iook better.

522
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,570
I took something.
Mind if I ask what?

523
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,243
Little of this,
Iittle of that.

524
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,306
I know
what's wrong with our patient.

525
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,908
He's depressed.

526
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,680
He told you that
when you woke him up?
Nope.

527
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,517
He told me he pissed his pants
and blacked out.

528
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,786
That's not diagnostic of
depression. Lack of appetite,
isolating yourself.

529
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,987
Uncontrollable urination
and blacking out
are good predictors of what?

530
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,120
Seizure.

531
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,630
Which means the seizure he had
when you tested his heart

532
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,667
was at Ieast
his second seizure.
So what?

533
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:01,137
Depression and seizures
aren't correlated.
No, but you know what is?

534
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,799
Depression
and anti-depression medicine.

535
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,433
Tox screen was clean.

536
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,705
Yeah, but you know
how much crap
he's got in his system

537
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,939
for dealing with those burns.

538
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,982
The guy could have
the Spanish Armada floating
through his bloodstream

539
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,644
and we wouldn't know about it,
till they started
firing cannons.

540
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,314
Antidepressants have been
known to cause seizures
in kids, but not orgasms.

541
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,553
This is a brain in trouble.
This is a brain
with too much serotonin.

542
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:26,427
Serotonin affects mood,
appetite, it doesn't cause
the brain to shut down.

543
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,625
Antidepressants fake brains
into thinking
they have more serotonin

544
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,031
than they actually do.

545
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,833
Every ten million or so cases
sets off a chain reaction.

546
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,534
Produces too much,
enough to fry itself.

547
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,974
If Adam has Serotonin Storm,
it's deadly.

548
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,274
But treatable. Cyproheptadine.

549
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,904
Unless he doesn't have
Serotonin Storm.

550
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,609
He could just as easily have
too much dopamine
as serotonin,

551
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:50,245
but if it's dopamine,
the cyproheptadine
will kill him.

552
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,290
Where are you going?
Gonna talk to the kid again,
he seems nice.

553
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,722
You can't.

554
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,616
Why? Did he say
he doesn't Iike me?

555
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,822
Anesthesiologist
told the parents what you did.

556
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,888
Everyone's a tattletale.

557
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,204
Is your son depressed?

558
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,244
No. Who are you?
I'm Dr. House.

559
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,574
Oh, you're the idiot
who thought...

560
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,443
I heard him screaming
all the way down the hallway.

561
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,382
If I didn't wake him up,
I wouldn't have Iearned
what caused the crash.

562
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,078
He had a seizure.

563
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,287
This wasn't my fault?

564
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,489
Well, if he hadn't
had the brain problem,
he wouldn't have the burns.

565
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,655
On the other hand,
if you hadn't put him
on the ATV,

566
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:34,959
he also
wouldn't have the burns.

567
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,193
You can debate
your personal responsibility
after I Ieave.

568
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,758
I need to wake him up again.

569
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,667
I need to know if
he's taking antidepressants.

570
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,000
He's not.

571
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,571
He's the happiest kid I know.
But you don't know, do you?

572
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,145
He's my son.

573
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,376
That's sort of my point.

574
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,851
At 16,
they'II tell anyone anything,
except their parents.

575
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,615
Adam talks to us
about everything.

576
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,747
Yeah, I know
about the pot and the cocaine.

577
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,689
There was never... Cocaine.
What...

578
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,853
Are you sure?
Are you having him followed?

579
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,523
He told us
when he got drunk at a party.

580
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,429
He told us
when he started having sex.

581
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,195
At 16? Way to go.

582
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,998
He told us
when he cheated
on a math test.

583
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,300
He told us
when his girlfriend
cheated on him.

584
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,342
He doesn't hide
anything from us.
But if he was depressed?

585
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,899
He'd tell us.

586
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,046
We don't judge,
he's not depressed,
we're sure.

587
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,241
"Bet his Iife on it" sure?

588
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,715
Just hypothetically.

589
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,380
Yeah.

590
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,018
Okay.

591
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,296
Kid's happy.

592
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,257
Happy, happy, happy.

593
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,969
Then we're back
to where we started.
Seizure disorders.

594
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,939
Seizure disorders
aren't causing orgasms.

595
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,634
Vascular malformations?

596
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,768
Would've seen it
on the sonogram.

597
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,903
Hepatic encephalopathy?

598
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,278
Liver enzyme tests
were normal.

599
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,656
Where are you going?
Take a Ieak.

600
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,858
What are you doing?

601
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,924
You can't come in here,
you're not sterile.

602
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,401
Don't touch our son,
we told you...

603
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,064
Seriously,
millions of bacteria,
microbes on you.

604
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,074
He'II die of sepsis.
If you go in there...

605
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,471
I think
he's gonna wake him up again.

606
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,106
I know he is.

607
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,681
House, you can't do this.

608
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,883
Oh, if I had a nickel
for every time
I've heard that. Relax.

609
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,586
Are they gonna sue us?
If I'm right, I save his Iife.

610
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,630
If I'm wrong,
he's dead no matter what I do.

611
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,933
Either way, how much
have I really hurt them?

612
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,263
Leave him alone!

613
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,735
You're not sterile.
Do you wanna kill the kid?

614
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,772
Give me the syringe.
No pain, no gain.

615
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,831
Hey, you gotta stop this.

616
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,480
They're right.

617
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,078
He's not depressed.
FOREMAN: Yeah, sure.

618
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,779
I'm not Ietting you go
till you give me that syringe.

619
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,845
What's that on his wrist?

620
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,151
A burn.

621
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,557
Why on his wrist?
Why not on his wrist?

622
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,529
His back, his torso,
everything's a mess.
His forearms are clean.

623
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,793
Except right there.
So what?

624
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,600
It's a perfect circle.

625
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,970
So a drop of burning gasoline
fell on his wrist,
a screw from the ATV.

626
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,868
Maybe.

627
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,853
Why are you torturing him?
Does your son smoke?

628
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,624
I'd kill him.

629
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:53,996
So, he can talk to you
about sex, crack,
anything except cigarettes.

630
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,826
He has a cigarette burn
on his wrist.

631
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,633
AIso a fading nicotine stain
between two fingers.

632
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,637
Bad news,
your son has a filthy,
unhealthy habit.

633
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,076
Good news,
he's trying to quit.

634
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,272
Bad news,
the quitting's killing him.

635
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,146
Good news,
I can cure him. Bad news...

636
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,848
Nope, that's the end of it.

637
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,912
Quitting smoking can kill?

638
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,219
No-smoke meds
are antidepressants.

639
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,351
The crappy ones
you get over the Internet

640
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,225
are Ioaded
with whatever antidepressants
they can get cheap.

641
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,597
And since Mommy and Daddy
obviously didn't take him
to a pediatrician...

642
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,939
Sorry, I was wrong
about him being depressed.

643
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,871
Treat him.

644
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:55,983
(DOOR OPENING)

645
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,152
CUDDY: Hey!

646
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,423
Did you drop acid?

647
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,000
Why would I do that?
To annoy me.

648
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,502
Or maybe because
you're miserable,

649
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,870
or because
you want to self-destruct.

650
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,505
Pick one.

651
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,936
How about because LSD
acts on serotonin receptors
in the brain,

652
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,812
which can stop
a migraine in its tracks.

653
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,819
I'm just saying
that's also a possibility.

654
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:26,323
How did you know about it?
Cameron is worried about you.

655
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,292
I told her that LSD Iasts
up to 1 2 hours, if you were
functional, she must be wrong.

656
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,194
Either that or I also took
a whole bunch
of antidepressants,

657
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,357
which short-circuited the LSD.

658
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,264
I'm just saying
that would also explain it.

659
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,632
Thank you for ruining
my clinical trials.

660
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,694
Pharmaceutical company's
shutting me down.

661
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,002
You're kidding. Really?
How could that surprise you?

662
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,268
You sent them an email

663
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,902
complaining about my math,
telling them about your stunt.

664
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,173
I didn't know
people actually read emails.

665
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,977
Delete button's
so conveniently Iocated.
So what's next?

666
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,607
You gonna follow me
my whole Iife?

667
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,482
Torture me?
Why would I do that?

668
00:40:56,554 --> 00:41:00,650
You waited 20 years
to do this. What's next?
Break up my marriage?

669
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,757
No. We're even.
Right.

670
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,059
Oh, thanks for setting me up.

671
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,137
Eye for an eye,
LSD and antidepressants.

672
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,772
Everything in balance.

673
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,903
Buddhists call it Karma.
Christians call it
the Golden Rule.

674
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,571
Jews call it...

675
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,881
I don't know,
Rabbi Hillel
said something poignant.

676
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,688
Universe
always settles the score.

677
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,992
Does it?
No.

678
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,419

679
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:51,130
Do you think you'II ever
be able to Iook at him
and not blame me?

680
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:55,068
Yeah. Will you?

681
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,802
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

682
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,195
PAULA: I'm Paula.

683
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,059
Hey, Paula.
How you doing?

684
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,629
You work over at the college,
or are you full-time
over at the...

685
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,970
I'm Iooking for a distraction.

686
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,575
You don't need to talk
to do that, do you?
