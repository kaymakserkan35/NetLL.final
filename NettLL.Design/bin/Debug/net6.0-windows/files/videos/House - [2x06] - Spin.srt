begin Lap Two, Jeff Forster
is leading the pack.

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,471
They're jockeying
for position, now...

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,037
This is so cool.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,273
Did we miss anything?

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,372
They've got, like,
1 1 laps to go.

6
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,412
We gotta find a good place
where he can see the sign
when he goes by.

a strong chase pack forming
led by Vernonski...

At this point in the race,
things are still
too close to call.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,856
It's anybody's race,
but Forster looks...

11
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,661

Can you see anything?

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,252
Did you bring his inhaler?

19
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,417
Crap!

20
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,326
I think it's in the car.
I'll go get it.

Are you okay?
Your dad's gonna
be right back...

23
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,634
I can see him.
He's right up front.

24
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,105
Honey, you're wheezing.

25
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,666

You're number one!

27

Ladies and gentlemen,
Forster is down.

29
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,069
Yeah!

30
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,874
We need to talk.

31
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:28,013
Oh, God. Are you pregnant?
'Cause I really wanna
finish high school.

32
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,346
You have to renew
your credential.

33
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,849
They're good
for two more months.

34
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,011
Three weeks.
And the paperwork
takes forever.

your malpractice insurance,

37
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,089
And you know
that's gonna take
some explaining.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,527
You know, our relationship
was way better when
we were sleeping together.

39
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,393
Why did we stop doing that?
Did you get married?

40
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,434
Yeah. Otherwise I'd be on you
like red on rice.

41
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,334
Look, rice isn't...
Oh, I get it.

42
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,996
You're also behind
on your dictations.

43
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,596
I don't do dictations.

44
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,164
Cameron does them,
or somebody.

45
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,301
And you can't have your sole
female employee

46
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,778
doing your clerical work,
which you'd know
if you'd attended

47
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,678
the required
sexual harassment seminars.

48
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,741
Now, I'm gonna pause
so you can make a crack
about harassment.

49
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:06,842
Joke killer.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,218
House, got a patient.

51
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,620
Sorry. Can't play anymore.
My mom's calling me.

52
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,394
We just admitted
a world-class cyclist.

53
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,692
You gotta fire Stacy.

54
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,097
Yeah, I'll get
right on that.

55
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,603
Jeff Forster,
respiratory arrest
at 30 miles per hour.

56
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,162
She's loading me up
with pointless paperwork.

57
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,398
Well, you're way behind
on your pointless paperwork.

58
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,602

She's hostile.

59
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,808
You know me,
hostility makes me
shrink up like a...

60
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,707
I can't think of
a non-sexual metaphor.

61
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,651
She's gonna stand
over my desk with a ruler,
checking my spelling...

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,312
ER checked
for lung infiltrates.
Nothing there.

63
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,347
Professional athletes,
Cuddy. It's like watching
an old movie at 2 a.m.

64
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,121
Reliving all the
classic moments.

65
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,890
The part where
he denies it's drugs.

66
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,296
The part where the good guys
ride in, tests a-blazing,

67
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,833
prove that it is drugs.

68
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,234
Oscar clip. He can't imagine
how they got into his body.

69
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,372
It's so familiar,
so comforting.

70
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,964
She can't handle
working with me.

71
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,440
Oh, right. Yeah.

72
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,376
She's still got a thing
for you, making it
impossible for her to deal.

73
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,573
It makes perfect sense,
except for the pronouns.

74
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,076
Anyway, thanks for getting me
out of that meeting.

75
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,713
He's not denying
the drugs.

76
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,992
I'm thinking
he's actually sick.

77
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,531
Jeff Forster, this is...

78
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,397
I'm a doctor.
You're a sick person.

79
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,968
And you are a loved one.
Actually, manager.

80
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,631
We've been together
for 7 years.

81
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,608
So what's the drug du jour
on the bike circuit
these days?

82
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,135
Still erythropoietin,
or are you guys
just chugging battery acid?

83
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,579
There's no way I'd touch EPO.

00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,648

10 bucks for the ticket,
six for the popcorn.

88
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,553
I do straight blood doping.

89
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,682
Plot twist.

90
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,985
That's a very daring
confession.

91
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,825
We've got confidentiality,
right?

92
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,365
Assuming I'm more ethical
than your client.

93
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,166
So, injecting yourself
with donor red blood cells
for fun and profit.

94
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,670
Any other tricks
up your sleeve?

95
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,469
Well, nothing much
recently.

96
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,711
I'm in town
for a charity ride,
so it didn't matter if I won.

97
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,311
The kids just needed
to see me.

98
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,473
If you go slower,
they see you longer.

99
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,281
Let's say that our health
could be affected by things
we did before last Friday.

100
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,652
Well,

101
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,855
I usually sleep
in a Hyperbaric Chamber.

102
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,297
I've been pumping up
electrolytes with an lV drip.

103
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:36,063
Anabolic herbal supplements,
amphetamines and diuretics.

104
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,064
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But why would you be sick?

105
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,268
I know that doping has risks.
I know that it's
outside the rules.

106
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:48,645
But I do what I have to
to kick ass at my job.
Don't you?

107
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,707
Dr. House is a firm believer
in good old-fashioned
hard work.

108
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,657
This guy
doesn't even get sick
like a regular person.

109
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,020
Instead of a list of symptoms
and no cause,

110
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,086
we have a list
of possible causes
for one symptom.

111
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,924
Is the symptom death?

112
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,590
Respiratory distress.

113
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,227
Insanity doesn't cause it.
I looked it up.

114
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,739
It's the doping.
Injecting extra red cells
boosts your endurance level

115
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,467
but it also
thickens your blood.

116
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,839
Thick blood equals clots
equals respiratory distress.

117
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,037
Not with a clean
spiral chest CT.

118
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,740
The guy's sleeping
in a Hyperbaric Chamber.

119
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,679
Over-oxygenation
can cause cell damage,

120
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,274
and if the cells
in the lungs
are damaged...

121
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,376
That'd cause pulmonary edema,
which he doesn't have.

122
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,717
The supplements
he's been taking
contain yohimbe

123
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,552
which can cause
nerve paralysis.

124
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,057
Tox-screen was normal.

125
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,420
All the tests were normal.

126
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,191
There's no clot,
no edema, and yet
he still can't breathe.

127
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,824
So there's something in here
that we can't see.

129
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,528

Come to Papa.

131
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,239
This guy's been
injecting himself
how many times a day?

132
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,742
All it'd take is
one slip of the needle
to cause an air embolus.

133
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,676
So, air is keeping him
from breathing air.

134
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,407
Well, let's go with that
for the irony.

135
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,310
Get a VQ scan
and check his veins
for bubbles.

Xenon 133.

137
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,627
It's just radioactive enough
for us to track the air
moving through your lungs.

138
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,184
Was my accident
on the news?

139
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,288
Yeah, you made
Plays of the Week.

140
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,358
A few more of those,
and cycling will be
as popular as NASCAR.

141
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,399
We inject similar stuff
into your blood
so we can watch it circulate.

142
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,707
If you accidentally
injected a bubble,

143
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,267
we'll see good air flow
but poor blood flow.

144
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,173
I'm careful, man.

145
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,708
With all due respect, man,

146
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,651
I doubt there's anything
wrong with you that you
didn't do to yourself.

she's got a picture of Jeff
above her bed.

was an alcoholic.

At least he hit
his own home runs.

He didn't physically
alter himself.

to help us fall asleep,
to stay awake...

Yeah, but we don't
make careers out of who
can stay awake the longest.

I don't know, med school?

throw a ball really far
or pedal really fast

both sides of the
conversation.

169
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,841
It's like white noise.
It's very peaceful.

170
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,460
Is there a light
somewhere that goes on
when I have food?

171
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,625
Green for food,
orange for beverages,
red for impure thoughts.

172
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,232
That bulb burns out
every two weeks.

173
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,394
How's your biker?

174
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,199
Pumped an air bubble
into a vein in his lung.

175
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,106
The things people do.
Doping, Vicodin...

176
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,609
Hey, you're talking about me,
aren't you?

177
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,310
I'm just trying to function.
He's trying to win himself
some little yellow jerseys.

178
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,709
Oh.

179
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,013
What?

180
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,418
Trouble in paradise.
2 o'clock.

181
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,547
Your 2 o'clock
or my 2 o'clock?

182
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,716
There.

183
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,760
She seems perfectly happy.

184
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,662
Obviously they
huddled in the hall and
worked up this circus act

185
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,929
on the off chance
you'd be in here.

186
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,903
She was unbelievably pissy
three hours ago.

187
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,098
Hmm.

188
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,535
Pissy with you,
happy with her husband.

189
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,941
Yes, there can only be
one possible explanation
for that.

190
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,377
When she's angry
she gets sarcastic.

191
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,105
When she's annoyed
she's funny.

192
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,774
But when she's frustrated
she gets pissy.

193
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,715
Yes, yes,
I'm with you so far.

194
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,721
She's miserable with Mark
because he's not me.

195
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,489
So she's gotta make me
not me,

196
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,115
so she makes
my professional life
miserable.

197
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,389
If I can't do my job...
You really, really
need to get some...

198
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,623
Oh, I get some
"some" all the time.

199
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,622
It's why I always need
to borrow some money.

200
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,363
Hi, James.
Greg, you gotten
to that paperwork?

201
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,863
I've been pissy.

202
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,032
Pardon me?

203
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,975
I've been busy.

204
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,345
When you save someone's life,
they owe you forever.

205
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,574
You're right. Take Stacy.

206
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,715
Oh, wait, she'd probably
just leave you all over again.

207
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,218
How's your recovery going?
Gotten around to the
small muscles yet?

208
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,689
It's not the size
of the muscle,
it's where you get to put it.

209
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:31,295
My goodness, it's like
watching Oscar Wilde and Noel
Coward in the third grade.

210
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,592
Excuse us.

211
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,467
How awkward was that?

212
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,603
What's he doing here anyway?
He's got physio
Tuesdays and Fridays.

213
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,244
Mark is in group therapy
for people coping with
disability.

214
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,243
He was thinking about
developing a drug addiction,

215
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,303
but that would be stupid.

216
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,283
Hey, you're...You, again.

217
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,516
WlLSON: You're not gonna
make some joke about
Mark being in therapy?

218
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,158
What's there to say? He's
doing the responsible thing.

219
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,929
I'm sure he's got
a lot to deal with.

220
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,796
You're making me nervous.

221
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:15,030
MOlRA: Every time
an athlete goes down,
you guys assume it's drugs.

222
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,903
Look, the doctors say
it's probably acid reflux.

223
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,644
Yeah, look, call me tomorrow.
There's a good chance
he'll be released.

224
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,307
Okay. Bye-bye.

225
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,450
So, is this fixing him?

226
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,248
If his acid reflux isn't worse
than we thought, yeah.

227
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,017
I gotta be in Spain
in four days.

228
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,756
Shouldn't be a problem.

229
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,952
Great.

230
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,326
If I could just
find the little bugger,
should be able to suck it out.

231
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,801
My legs feel weak.

232
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,773
You're under mild sedation
for the test. It'll wear off.

233
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,167
CHASE: There it is.

234
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,619
Got it.
Fantastic,
I'll pack his things.

235
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,748
Not yet. I wanna monitor him
for a couple of hours,
make sure he's okay.

236
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,394
Give him time
to sign a picture for me,
maybe even a jersey.

237
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,622
"To Doctor Chase,
I owe you everything."

238
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,562
(STAMMERlNG) It doesn't
have to be that personal.

239
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,992
Not too many eBay shoppers
named Doctor Chase, huh?

240
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,336
Still trying to unload
the Barbara Walters spit cup.

241
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,565
MOlRA: Here you go.

242
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,677
Seriously,
anything's fine.

243
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,375
Jeff!

244
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,181
CHASE: You all right?

245
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,621
Jeff, can you swallow?

246
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,760
What makes a guy
start drooling?

247
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,659
Chase, were you wearing
your short shorts?

248
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,893
Muscle fatigue
in his neck and jaw.

249
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,161
He's obviously
got something worse
than an air embolus.

250
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,261
Why?

251
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,272
Because you don't
drool from your lungs?

252
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,037
Maybe the problem
is not the embolus itself.
Maybe it's the treatment.

253
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,304
Maybe you hit a nerve,
literally.

254
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,878
The embolectomy was clean.
His legs were tired, too.

255
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,450
I thought it was
from the sedation,
but if not,

256
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,714
it means he's got
something systemic.

257
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,689
Which means it would have
nothing to do with
the stunts he's been pulling.

258
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,023
Lupus or polymyositis.

259
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,686
It explains the progressive
muscle weakness.

260
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,787
It could be ALS.

261
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,058
He's too young for that.

262
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,565
Some type of
muscular dystrophy?

263
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,067
He's too old for that.

264
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,126
So what would be
just right, Goldilocks?

265
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,840
HOUSE: Full blood workup,
including ANA for lupus.

266
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:33,311
And get a muscle biopsy.
Find out if we're talking
myopathy or neuropathy.

267
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,879
I'm late for my session.

268
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,074
Session?

269
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,883
It's all a part
of the process.

270
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,575
You get angry
and then you get...

271
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,179
Yeah. I'm right on schedule.

272
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,287
So, when am I gonna be done?

273
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,023
No, I need to know,
'cause I got plans to make.

274
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,528
When can I safely
book a game of squash?

275
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,664
MARK: When am I gonna
stop being angry?

276
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,892
Not today.

277
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,993
I've come for the healing.

278
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,567
Dr. Harper, as you know,
I have a bum leg.

279
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,777
What you don't know is
I'm upset about it.
I need to talk.

280
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,708
You know House.
You know we have a history.

281
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,276
You've been
telling me for years
that I should come by.

282
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,052
Here I am. Hi, guys.

283
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,418
HARPER: I've got
a Thursday group.
Poker night.

284
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,557
Monday morning?
Book club.

285
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,232
Well, look, if it's a problem,
I'll just go deal with my rage
privately.

286
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,323
Wait.

287
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,765
If you two could
resolve this tension,

288
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,736
you could really
help each other.

289
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,536
I'm tired of fighting.

290
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,707
So either I say yes
or I'm the jerk?

291
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,908
Oh, God, I know that feeling.

292
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,646
I took the muscle specimen
from Jeff's thigh.

293
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,316
I figured that's where
we'd have the best chance
at finding something.

294
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,382
The most painful place
to cut into.

295
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,188
I assume
that's caffeine-free.

296
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,662
Wouldn't want to be
artificially boosting
your performance.

297
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,132
Don't start her up again.

298
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,463
Caffeine's legal.

299
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,965
All about the rules, eh?

300
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,630
It's a bike race,

301
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,500
a completely
arbitrary set of rules
that everyone complies with

302
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,374
for no other reason than that
some committee says
that they should.

303
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,644
But that's the point.
That's what the game is.

304
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,877
So, if you
break an arbitrary rule,
Cameron damns you to hell.

305
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,851
But if you break a rule
that actually has a reason

306
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,319
that's designed
to protect people,

307
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,413
Cameron develops
a crazy crush on you.

308
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,822
House doesn't pretend
to be some golden boy.

309
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,985
He does it to help people,
not to glorify himself.

310
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,256
So why don't you report Jeff
to the biking authorities?

311
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,253
Ethics.

312
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,357
Well, you
wouldn't be doing it
to glorify yourself.

313
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,163
You'd just be trying
to make a better world.

314
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,569
At least you can
still get around
on your own.

315
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,668
Yeah, I know.

316
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,041
But you're starting to walk.
You're gonna get better.

317
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,939
You have a job,
a way to be productive.

318
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,613
And you have a wife.

319
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,615
Which gives greater meaning?

320
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,087
A wife could
make things harder, too,
I suppose.

321
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,318
This isn't about Stacy.

322
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,695
When it happened to me,
Stacy was great.

323
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,190
She kept telling me
not to rush it.

324
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,235
I never believed her.

325
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,260
She means it.

326
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,766
I know, but...

327
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,435
Stacy. She shouldn't
have to wait, right?

328
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,611
And you know
she feels it, too.

329
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,148
There's more time at work.
There's more satisfaction
from work.

330
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,581
She didn't get married
to be a nursemaid.

331
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,090
She wants a man.

332
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,628
How the hell could she
have loved a manipulative
son of a bitch like you?

333
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,137
That's an interesting
question.

334
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,073
Maybe she was attracted
to different things
in the two of us.

335
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,166
She left you.

336
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,505
But why was she with me
to begin with?

337
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,806
She made a mistake.

338
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,369
Maybe it's that simple.

339
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,046
Or maybe she saw
something in me,

340
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,549
something she doesn't get
from you.

341
00:16:58,617 --> 00:16:59,641
I'm not an ass.

342
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,810
Maybe she wanted an ass.

343
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:01,910
She obviously did once.

344
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,318
Either he goes or I go.

345
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,050
You think
that's the kind of thing
you can just turn off?

346
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,321
Get him out of here!
Dr. House,
cancel your book group.

347
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,025
You're coming on Mondays.

348
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,833
Here's my new theory.
The drooling's another
competitive edge.

349
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,229
Nobody can draft behind it.
The road gets slick.

350
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,796
He's the only one
not racing in the rain.

351
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,866
He can barely move
his arms and legs.

352
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,943
Paralysis?
No, just general weakness.

353
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,243
Muscle biopsy is negative
for polymyositis.

354
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,681
And ALS
and muscular dystrophy.

355
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,810
FOREMAN: ANA for lupus,
also negative.

356
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,718
CAMERON: Maybe his bike shorts
are just on too tight.

357
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,519
So, by your rationale,
House shouldn't use a cane.

358
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,082
He should just drag
his bum leg around
as God intended?

359
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,358
House has a handicap.
All he's aiming for
is normality.

360
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,955
CHASE: And who decides
what's normal?

361
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,523
What if we find a drug
that makes people live
20 years longer?

362
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,898
Should we ban that
because it's not normal?

363
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,335
Jeff doesn't want normal.
He wants superpowers.

364
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,897
So why is he normal?

365
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,702
Oh, God, you too?

366
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,867
He's shooting
for extraordinary.

367
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,435
So why is everything
so ordinary?

368
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,641
I mean, this guy's breathing,
drinking and injecting himself

369
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,911
with everything he can find
to amp up his body chemistry,

370
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,247
and yet every test is normal.

371
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,021
He's artificially raising
his red blood count,
so why isn't it raised?

372
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,388
Maybe his count is raised.

373
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,394
Maybe what's normal for us
is out of whack for him.

374
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,256
Can't slip anything by you.

375
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,355
FOREMAN: Well, if that's true,
his white cells are up, too.

376
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,229
Which would point
to some kind of infection.

377
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,634
Muscle weakness, exhaustion.
He could have encephalitis.

378
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,763
That's kind of a long shot.
HOUSE: Yeah.

379
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,040
But it's been over an hour
since we've poked the patient

380
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,703
with something sharp.
So, get a lumbar puncture

381
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,040
and order broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

382
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,848
CUDDY:
No, it's not about judging.

383
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,682
It's just that
on a dating service
you should post a photo.

384
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,180
I have to go.

385
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,988
I am so sorry to bother you.
Nope, not a problem.

386
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,494
I was just accounting.

387
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,393
I'm Jeff Forster's manager.

388
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,931
He's been here a whole day,

389
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,991
and it doesn't seem
like we're any closer
to a diagnosis.

390
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,832
Jeff Forster.
A whole day, huh?

391
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,132
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,606
I was just wondering
if I could help
speed things up.

393
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,042
Your client's
had a muscle biopsy,
a full blood workup

394
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,546
and he's scheduled
for a lumbar puncture
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

395
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,242
Jeff is in the Lucas Wing.

396
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,807
If Mr. Lucas showed up
needing a lumbar puncture,

397
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,581
would he have to
wait until tomorrow?

398
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,781
Mr. Lucas is dead.
Good.

399
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,050
Then there's an opening.

400
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,659
Jeff is used to doing
whatever he has to
to be first, isn't he?

401
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,322
It's been
very lucrative for him.

402
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,331
He feels it's important
that he give something back.

403
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,232
I hear you've been
raising funds for your
nuclear medicine department

404
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,265
or whatever.

405
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,716
(RASPlNG) Thank you, guys,
for working so late.

406
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:49,913
Glad to be here.

407
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,749
FOREMAN: The lumbar puncture
will tell us what kind of
infection you've got.

408
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,351
In the meantime,
we're administering
antibiotics.

409
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,294
Do you like being a hero?

410
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,863
It's a living.

411
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,829
You don't feel
a sense of responsibility?

412
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,395
There's kids out there
that worship you.

413
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,668
When I was a rookie
on the tour,

414
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,245
I got a letter
from a guy in Wisconsin.

415
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,477
He wanted me
to send a note to his son.

416
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,284
He said he worshipped me.

417
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,719
You know what worship means?
I looked it up.

418
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,961
It means to love
unquestioningly
and uncritically.

419
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,259
(GASPlNG)

420
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,394
So the kid
doesn't even know me,
but he loves me

421
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,238
unquestioningly
and uncritically.

422
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,933
So you decided
to take advantage of that.

423
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:49,605
What should I have done?
"Dear sir, I'm just a guy

424
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,848
"who rides a bike pretty good.

425
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,147
"You and your kid
are out of your minds."

426
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,981
My arms feel funny.

429
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,792
The sats are dropping.
He's in respiratory arrest.

430
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,263
He can't be. We fixed that.

431
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,124
Apparently not.

432
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,551
HOUSE: So glad we cured
his respiratory arrest.

433
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,945
It freed him up to develop
respiratory arrest.

434
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,080
LP was negative
for encephalitis.

435
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,383
The white count's
still the same,

436
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,755
but the red count's
fallen to 29%.

437
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,224
What was my theory yesterday?

438
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,126
That I screwed up
the embolectomy.

439
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,922
We'll get a chest x-ray
to check.

440
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,432
I didn't screw up.
Why would you...

441
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,833
How can you
be so petty, Chase?
He's down a quart.

442
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,628
Either he's losing blood
because you nicked something

443
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,832
or he's just
not producing blood,

444
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,898
in which case,
we're talking acute anemia

445
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,238
combined with
a muscular disorder.

446
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,938
Paraneoplastic syndrome?

447
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,606
Either you screwed up
or he's got cancer.

448
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,654
I think I should
start smoking again.

449
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,822
You want a medical opinion
supporting that decision?

450
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,091
The symptoms started
as soon as I quit.

451
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,564
Symptoms meaning diarrhea.

452
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,892
A lot of diarrhea.
10 or 1 2 times a day.

453
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,427

to confront your feelings."

Fine, you don't want help.
Does that mean
nobody should get it?

460
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,718
Mark's looking for help
because, what, he's
resentful, overwhelmed?

461
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:40,985
I'm asking because I care.

462
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,117
Not about him.

This is unbelievably
difficult for Mark,
which you should know.

able to summon up
some level of empathy for.

Right. The crippled boys.
We should start a band.

anything to do with me?

Sugarless gum uses sorbitol
as a sweetener.

We use sorbitol as a laxative.

This will tell you
if he's got cancer
in his blood?

If he does, we'll see

will the tests take?

as soon as I can.

And if he
doesn't have cancer,
what else could it be?

500
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,162

was done during one of
the tests we gave him.

00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,121
No way.

670
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,131
No. We'll find something.

671
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,936
We found a thymoma.
How'd you know
to look in his neck?

672
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,774
Thymoma's usually present
in the chest.

673
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,677
I knew it wasn't
in his chest.

674
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,550
All we've done
since he checked in
is look at his chest.

675
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,382
All the more reason
not to think...
There are two types of PRCA.

676
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,252
Acute comes on suddenly,
chronic takes its time.

677
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,319
We all thought Jeff's
was acute because it happened
right in front of us.

678
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,918
But what if it'd been there
for months, maybe years?

679
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,896
There's no way.
It would have kept him
from racing.

680
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,057
With that kind of anemia,
he would have needed
constant...

681
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,394
Blood transfusions.

682
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,268
Which he was getting
in convenient
blood doping form.

683
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,364
He was treating himself
without even knowing it.

684
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,878
Up to half of patients
with chronic PRCA
have a thymoma.

685
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,570
And up to half of patients
with a thymoma...

686
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,583
I've always
wanted to do this.

687
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,688
I'm not getting any better.
Does that mean I'm...

688
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,230
You are healed. Rise and walk.

689
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,830
Are you insane?

690
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,929
In the Bible,
people just say, "Yes, Lord,"

691
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,940
and then start right in
on the praising.

692
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,703
First you tell me
I've got cancer.

693
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,181
And then you tell me
that my manager...

694
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,125
What did you do?

695
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,526
No, "What did you do, Lord?"

696
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,327
Thymoma is a tumor
on the thymus gland.

697
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,298
He's a bit of a wimp,
but he hangs with
the tough guys.

698
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:45,865
PRCA and an autoimmune disease
called myasthenia gravis.

699
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,435
MG causes muscle fatigue

700
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,481
including respiratory problems
and difficulty swallowing.

701
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,244
And it can hit you
that fast?

702
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,650
The treatment for PRCA
is blood transfusions.

703
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,848
The treatment for MG
is hyperbaria.

704
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,752
You were doing both
as part of your regular
freak show.

705
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,885
When you took a break,
everything went to hell,

706
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,696
which is not
an uncommon reaction
in Jersey.

707
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,860
So, the whole thing
with my manager...

708
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,596
Oops. No, no EPO.

709
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,474
This has nothing to do
with anything you did.

710
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,874
You can let her know
she's in the clear.
I could.

711
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:24,112
Or 10% of a Nike contract

712
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,082
is a hell of a lot of cash.

713
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,214
You don't need your thymus.

714
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,949
If we take it out,
everything else is manageable.

715
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,718
Manageable?
I thought you just cured me.

716
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,453
Uh-uh.
This is just diagnostic.

717
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:40,088
Tensilon erases
the symptoms of MG
for five or six minutes.

718
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,227
(GASPlNG)

719
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,901
Sometimes less.

720
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,838
This is exactly
why I created nurses.

721
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,008
Clean up on Aisle Three!

722
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,587
If you've come
to search my office,
you should wait 10 minutes.

723
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,060
I'll be out of your hair.

724
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,326
Here, start with my purse.
Just save me some mints.

725
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,694
What do you wanna know?
My sex life with Mark?

726
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,862
My guilt over
crippling your damn leg?

727
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,665
Or are you just here to gloat
because you weren't the leak?

728
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,506
I want to apologize.

729
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,104
Maybe I've

730
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,279
been punishing you
for a little too long.

731
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,548
And maybe you've been
punishing me.

732
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,290
If we're going to
work together,
I need to know.

733
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,833
Do you hate me
or do you love me?

734
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,200
Either way, I think
we've got a problem.

735
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,568
I hate you and I love you.

736
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,345
And I love Mark.

737
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,948
And you don't hate him.

738
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,114
No.

739
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,227
So what do we do?

740
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,490
We deal with each other.

741
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,890
Right.

742
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,027
That plan's been
working great so far.

743
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,073
It'll get better.
It'll get easier.

744
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,207
Why?
I don't know.

745
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,868
That's what my therapist
tells me.

746
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,622
JEFF ON T V.: In the
professional cycling world,
we are subject to

747
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:00,034
what seems like
constant witch-hunts
and finger-pointing.

748
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,274
But I want to thank Dr. House
and the excellent medical team

749
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,900
here at Princeton-Plainsboro.

750
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,910
My hope is that this diagnosis

751
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,742
will put to rest any rumors
that I would ever...

752
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,976
He needs blood transfusions
every two weeks,

753
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,984
which means
he can dope all he wants.

754
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,186
He's got a doctor's pass.

755
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,452
It's medicinal.

756
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,390
He got away with it.

757
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,089
Mmm-hmm.

758
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,687
He cheated and won a game.

759
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:32,192
Life's more complicated than
who gets to the finish line
first.

760
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,338
I fell in love
with my husband's best friend.

761
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,713
Near the end,
I was at the hospital
every day,

762
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,146
and Joe would come by
after work.

763
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,120
We'd go for walks
and try to talk each other
through it.

764
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,317
We kind of clung on
to each other.

765
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,857
My wife

766
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,838
wasn't dying.
She wasn't even sick.

767
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,801
Everything was fine.

768
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,437
But I met someone who

769
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,873
made me feel funny.

770
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:23,510
Good.

771
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,182
And I didn't want to
let that feeling go.

772
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,793
What happened to you?

773
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,996
How can anyone
go through that alone?

774
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,395
You can't control
your emotions.

775
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,565
No.

776
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,471
Just your actions.

777
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,720
You didn't do it, did you?
You didn't sleep with him.

778
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,419
I couldn't have
lived with myself.

779
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,398
You'd be surprised
what you can live with.

780
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,045
Hey.

781
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,018
I need you to open a door.

782
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,183
It's not allowed.

783
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,053
(STAMMERlNG) Yeah,
I was having therapy
in here today

784
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,589
and I left my cane.

785
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,858
Sorry.

786
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,534
Dude,

787
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,237
I'm crippled.
