1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:03,343


2
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:05,812
Dean!

3
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:06,590
Lisa.

4
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:08,904
You know how I never
mentioned my job?

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:09,494
This is my job.

6
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:12,608
Ben wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for you.

7
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:14,009
You're welcome to stay.

8
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:15,182
I can't.

9
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:16,789
It's not my life.

10
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,745
There is someone besides Michael

11
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,644
strong enough to take on Lucifer.

12
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,273
- And who's that?
- God.

13
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:25,106
I'm gonna find god.

14
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,277
I'm Joshua.

15
00:00:26,312 --> 00:00:27,348
You... talk to god?

16
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:29,519
He knows that the apocalypse
has begun.

17
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:32,350
He just doesn't think
it's his problem.

18
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:34,348
- Not his problem?
- He's finished.

19
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:37,280
Just another deadbeat dad
with a bunch of excuses, right?

20
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:39,012
Maybe Joshua was lying.

21
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:40,012
I don't think he was.

22
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:42,449
You son of a bitch.

23
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:44,188
I believed...

24
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:46,457
We'll find another way.

25
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:48,160
We can still stop all this, Dean.

26
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:49,196
How?

27
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:50,162
I don't know

28
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:51,630
But we'll find it, you and me.

29
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:54,100
We'll find it.

30
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:08,183
- Drive faster, Dean.
- I can't!

31
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,618
Are you okay?

32
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,986
Yeah, I'm amazing.

33
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,287
You ever seen that many?

34
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,755
No. No way.
Not in one place.

35
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,323
What the hell?

36
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:29,934
Damn it!

37
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,387
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

38
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:26,893
You two all right?

39
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:33,333
Peachy.

40
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:36,102
Be careful. It's... dangerous around here.

41
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:37,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait.

42
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:39,471
No need to thank us.

43
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:40,939
No, hold up a sec!
Who are you?

44
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,608
We're the sacrament
Lutheran militia.

45
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:45,176
I'm sorry... the what?

46
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,244
I hate to tell you this,
but those were demons,

47
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,846
and this is the apocalypse.

48
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,015
So... buckle up.

49
00:02:55,051 --> 00:03:00,687
Season 5 Episode 17
   "99 Problems"

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,168
Looks like we're in
the same line of business.

51
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:12,636
Yeah, and among colleagues.

52
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,040
That's a police-issued shotgun.

53
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:17,441
That truck is, uh...

54
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,010
inspired.

55
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:20,277
Where'd you guys
pick up all this crap?

56
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:23,547
You know, you... pick
things up along the way.

57
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,016
Guys, come on.

58
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:29,318
This whole corner of the state
is nuts with demon omens.

59
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:30,686
We just want to help, that's all.

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,188
We're on the same team here.

61
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:34,189
Just talk to us.

62
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,563
Follow us.

63
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:10,491
Dylan, it's a church.
Headphones off.

64
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:11,892
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,007
Who would have thought the
apocalypse could be so romantic?

66
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:33,547
Marriage, family... it's a blessing.

67
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:37,018
Especially in times like this.

68
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:40,089
So hold on to that.

69
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:42,558
Wedding?

70
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,792
Seriously?

71
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,160
Yeah.

72
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:49,264
We've had eight
so far this week.

73
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:53,364
Congratulations!

74
00:04:55,406 --> 00:05:01,277
So, Rob tells me
you boys hunt demons.

75
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,245
Uh... yes, sir.

76
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,884
You missed a few.

77
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:11,453
Yeah, tell us about it.

78
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:12,988
Any idea why they're here?

79
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,991
They sure seem to like us, though.

80
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:18,160
Follow me, gentlemen.

81
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:23,565
So, you're a preacher.

82
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:25,066
Not what you expected, huh?

83
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:26,568
Well, dude you're packing.

84
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:27,769
Strange times.

85
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:38,580
Is that a 12-year-old
packing salt rounds?

86
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,115
Everybody pitches in.

87
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,649
So, the whole church?

88
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:42,851
The whole town.

89
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,820
A whole town full of hunters?

90
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:46,755
I don't know whether
to run screaming or buy a condo.

91
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:48,590
Well, the demons were killing
us. We had to do something.

92
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:50,825
So why not call
the national guard?

93
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,894
- We were told not to.
- By who?

94
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,030
Come on, padre.

95
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,832
You're as locked and loaded
as we've ever seen.

96
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:58,966
And that exorcism was enochian.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,902
Someone's telling you something.

98
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:04,671
Look, I'm sorry.
I, uh, I can't discuss it.

99
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,673
- Dad, it's okay.
- Leah...

100
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:09,309
It's Sam and Dean Winchester.
They're safe.

101
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,112
I know all about them.

102
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,014
You do?

103
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:16,982
Sure.

104
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:18,316
From the angels.

105
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,818
The angels.

106
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:20,852
Awesome.

107
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,088
Don't worry. They can't see you here.

108
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:25,057
The... marks on your ribs, right?

109
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:30,996
So, you know all about us
because angels told you?

110
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:33,199
Yes, among other things.

111
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,501
Like the snappy little
exorcism spell.

112
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,837
And they show me where
the demons are gonna be

113
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,806
before it happens,
how to fight back.

114
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,408
She's never been wrong.
Not once.

115
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,877
- She's very special.
- Dad.

116
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:47,181
Let me guess... before
you see something,

117
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:50,050
you get a really bad migraine,
you see flashing lights?

118
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,319
How'd you know?

119
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,322
'cause you're not the
first prophet we've met.

120
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:56,257
But you are the cutest.

121
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:01,495
I mean that with
total respect, of course.

122
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,001
You've reached
the voicemail of...

123
00:07:07,603 --> 00:07:10,871
I don't understand. Why do
you want me to say my name?

124
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,743
Cass. Hey. Uh, it's me.

125
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:19,145
So, we are
in blue earth, Minnesota,

126
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:21,100
and, um, we could use a little help.

127
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:24,288
I... hope you get this.

128
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,814
Busy night.

129
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,383
I'm telling you,
since the end started,

130
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,884
it's been like
one long last call.

131
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,054
- That round's on me.
- Thanks.

132
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,762
So, did you
get a hold of Cass?

133
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,666
Yeah, I left him
a message, I think.

134
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,167
So, uh, what's your theory?

135
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,336
Why all the demon hits?

136
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,470
I don't know.

137
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:54,975
Gank the girl prophet, maybe?

138
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,545
What?

139
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,280
Just, these angels
are sending these people

140
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:01,548
to do their dirty work.

141
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,886
Yeah, and?

142
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,288
And they could
get ripped to shreds.

143
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:14,083
We're all gonna die, Sam.

144
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,252
In like a month... maybe two.

145
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,720
I mean it.

146
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:19,889
I mean, this is
the end of the world.

147
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:23,426
But these people
aren't freaking out.

148
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,696
In fact, they're running to
the exits in an orderly fashion.

149
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,564
I don't know that...
that's such a bad thing.

150
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:32,068
Who says they're all gonna die?

151
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,372
Whatever happened
to us saving them?

152
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,017
Something I said?

153
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,287
Paul, what's going on?

154
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,822
Leah's had another vision.

155
00:08:57,594 --> 00:08:59,895
Want to go to church?

156
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,499
You know me...
downright pious.

157
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,302
3 miles off Talmadge Road.

158
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:09,739
5 miles.

159
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,307
There are demons gathered.

160
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,809
I... don't know
how many, but a lot.

161
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,444
Thank you, Leah.

162
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,079
So, who's gonna join me?

163
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:19,115
Wouldn't miss it.

164
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:23,519
Someone's got to cover Rob's ass.

165
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:25,287
We're in, padre.

166
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:26,455
Thank you.

167
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:29,455
I'd like to offer a prayer.

168
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:33,886
Our father in heaven...

169
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,621
Yeah, not so much.

170
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,859
help us to fight in your name.

171
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,059
We ask that you protect
us from all servants of evil.

172
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,859
Guide our hands
in defeating them...

173
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,859
and deliver us home safely.

174
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,569
Thank you. Amen.

175
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,788
I guess that's what it's like, huh?

176
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,223
What?

177
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:48,924
Having backup.

178
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:53,195
Dean! Sam!

179
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,263
Yo.

180
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,431
Hey.

181
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,732
So, um, is... is that...

182
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,968
Is that cool if I get
a ride back with you guys?

183
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:04,039
Hey, you saved my
ass twice already.

184
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:05,574
One more time,
you can drive.

185
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:06,742
You have a beer?

186
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:13,449
Hey.

187
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,284
You earned it.
Don't tell your mom.

188
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,987
Oh, believe me... I will not.

189
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,183
No.

190
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,767
Ma'am, we're just, um, very sorry.

191
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,269
You know...

192
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:09,637
this is your fault.

193
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:10,605
Jane.

194
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:15,605
Come on.

195
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,325
I wish I knew what to say.

196
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:33,995
But I don't.

197
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:37,298
I'm so sorry, Jane.

198
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:40,924
Rob...

199
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,926
there are no words

200
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:45,229
Dylan...

201
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:48,732
I don't know why this happened.

202
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:52,703
I don't know why
any of this is happening.

203
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,540
I got no easy answers.

204
00:13:58,643 --> 00:13:59,810
But what I do know is...

205
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:01,712
Leah? Leah, honey?

206
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:04,815
Leah, honey?

207
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:07,651
Honey?

208
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:09,720
it's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

209
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,259
Dad, it's Dylan.

210
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:16,460
Just rest a minute, huh?

211
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:18,495
No, listen.

212
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,130
Dylan's coming back.

213
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:28,572
Jane, Rob...

214
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,574
it's going to be okay.

215
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:31,842
You'll see Dylan again.

216
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:36,380
When the final day
comes, judgement day,

217
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,449
he'll be resurrected, and
you'll be together again.

218
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:42,619
We'll all be together...
with all our loved ones.

219
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:44,321
We've been chosen.

220
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:47,291
The angels have chosen us

221
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,660
and we will be given
paradise on earth.

222
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:54,097
All we have to do is follow
the angels' commandments.

223
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:03,496
No drinking, no gambling,
no premarital sex?

224
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:05,198
Dean, they basically just outlawed

225
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:06,766
90% of your personality.

226
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,169
Yeah, well, whatever.
When in Rome.

227
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:12,438
So, uh... you're cool with it?

228
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:15,108
I'm not cool. I'm
not, not cool. It's...

229
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:16,442
look, man,
I'm not a prophet.

230
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:17,911
We're not locals.

231
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,412
It's not my call.

232
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,051
I'll catch up with you.

233
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:34,427
This a bad time?

234
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:37,664
In general.

235
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,933
But now's okay.

236
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:47,740
Angel stuff really
takes it out of you, huh?

237
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:51,544
Can't complain. I
know you have it worse.

238
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:57,283
So... what's on your mind, Dean?

239
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:04,991
Don't take this
the wrong way, but...

240
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,793
are you on the level?

241
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:08,294
About what

242
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:13,233
About paradise.

243
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,533
What about it?

244
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:20,462
I want to know what
the angels are telling you.

245
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:22,364
Everything.

246
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,766
Well...

247
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,834
And you can skip
the rainbows.

248
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:28,470
There's gonna be a prizefight,

249
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:32,341
and... it's gonna get bad.

250
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,511
But after we win...

251
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:37,279
And we will...

252
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:39,848
the planet gets handed
over to the chosen,

253
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:43,852
and... it's finally peaceful.

254
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:48,924
No monsters, no disease, no death.

255
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,294
You're just...

256
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:55,697
with the people you love.

257
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,704
'Course, that's if you can
get past the velvet rope.

258
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:06,341
Must be nice... being chosen.

259
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:08,710
Well, Dean...

260
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:10,012
you're chosen.

261
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,382
Yeah,

262
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,150
more like cursed.

263
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,454
Must be hard.

264
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:24,426
Being the vessel of heaven
and having no hope.

265
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:38,963
Hey.

266
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:43,451
So, what happened to, uh,
"the apocalypse is good for business"?

267
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:43,738
Oh, yeah.

268
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,305
Right up until Leah's angel pals
banned the good stuff.

269
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,107
Help me kill some inventory?

270
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,074
Sure.

271
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:51,309
Don't get me wrong.

272
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:53,444
I grew up here. I love this town.

273
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,479
But, uh...

274
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,815
well, these holy rollers...

275
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,449
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:01,653
I, uh, I noticed you're
not the praying type.

277
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:04,189
Yeah, well, between you and me,
neither are half those guys.

278
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:06,324
Couple of months back,
they were all in here,

279
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,927
Getting wasted, banging the nanny.

280
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,662
Now they're all warriors of god.

281
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:11,663
Cheers.

282
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:12,664
Cheers.

283
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:22,140
Look, there's sure as hell demons.

284
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:24,209
And maybe there is a god.

285
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:26,811
I don't know. Fine.
But I'm not a hypocrite.

286
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,547
I never prayed before,
and I ain't starting now.

287
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:31,716
If I go to hell, I'm going honest.

288
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,285
How 'bout you?

289
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,620
What about me?

290
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,222
Not a true believer, I take it?

291
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,159
I believe, yeah.

292
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:42,227
I do.

293
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:43,862
I'm just...

294
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:47,131
pretty sure god stopped
caring a long time ago.

295
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:56,463
Where you been?

296
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,899
Drinkin'.

297
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,734
Huh, you rebel.

298
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:03,537
I'd have had more, um...

299
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:04,772
but it was curfew.

300
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:06,240
Right.

301
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:08,175
You hear they shut
down the cell towers?

302
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:12,279
No. That's, uh, news to me

303
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:13,280
Yeah.

304
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:15,883
No cable, internet.

305
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:18,886
Total cut-off from the
"corruption of the outside world."

306
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,255
Huh.

307
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,390
Don't you get it?

308
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,025
They're turning this place

309
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,428
Into some kind of
fundamentalist compound.

310
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:28,762
No, I get it.

311
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:30,531
And all you got's a "hmm"?

312
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:31,832
What's wrong with you?

313
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,600
I get it. I just don't care.

314
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:34,601
What?

315
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:38,272
What difference does it make?

316
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:39,506
It makes a hell of a...

317
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:45,279
At what point does this
become too far for you?

318
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:48,382
Stoning, poisoned cool-aid.

319
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,784
The angels are toying
with these people.

320
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:52,152
Angel world, angel rules, man.

321
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:53,554
And since when is that
okay with you?

322
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:55,723
Since the angels got the
only lifeboats on the Titanic.

323
00:19:57,425 --> 00:20:00,160
I mean, who exactly is supposed to
come along and save these people?

324
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,795
It was supposed to be us.

325
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,430
We can't do it.

326
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:05,232
So, what, you... you want to...

327
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:08,001
you want to just
stop fighting, roll over?

328
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:09,970
I don't know, maybe.

329
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,164
Don't say that.

330
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,066
- Why not?
- 'Cause you can't do this.

331
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,667
Actually, I can.

332
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:21,271
No, you can't. You
can't do this to me.

333
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:29,212
I got one thing... one
thing keeping me going.

334
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:32,148
You think you're the only one
white-knuckling it here, Dean?

335
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:35,519
I can't count on anyone else.

336
00:20:35,553 --> 00:20:37,487
And I can't do this alone.

337
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,361
Dean.

338
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,830
I got to clear my head.

339
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:48,899
It's past curfew.

340
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:53,336
It's past curfew.

341
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,175
Leah. What's wrong?

342
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,710
Daddy, can I talk to
you for a second?

343
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:01,811
Of course.

344
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,117
Leah, honey, w-wha is it?

345
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:09,386
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
They're just so angry.

346
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,221
- Who's angry?
- The angels.

347
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,356
Why are they angry?

348
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,559
They said...

349
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:17,961
they said that we
can't go to paradise.

350
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:19,062
What?

351
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:22,399
But we're doing
everything they say!

352
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,301
They said they gave
clear commandments,

353
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:25,936
but some people aren't listening.

354
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,371
Who, Leah?

355
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:44,577
I got your message.

356
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:49,215
It was long, your message.

357
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:52,885
And I find the sound
of your voice grating.

358
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,787
What's wrong with you?

359
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:58,190
Are you...

360
00:21:58,225 --> 00:21:59,291
drunk?

361
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,428
No!

362
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,298
Yes.

363
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,468
What the hell happened to you?

364
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,503
I found a liquor store.

365
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,638
And?

366
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:14,106
And I drank it.

367
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,541
Why'd you call me?

368
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:18,077
Whoa. There you go. Easy.

369
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:19,311
Are you okay?

370
00:22:24,351 --> 00:22:26,218
Don't ask stupid questions.

371
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:29,822
Tell me what you need.

372
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:32,524
T-there have been these...
these demon attacks.

373
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,859
Massive, right on
the edge of town

374
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,261
and we can't figure
out why they're...

375
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:36,262
Any sign of angels?

376
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:37,429
Sort of.

377
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:39,331
They've been speaking
to this prophet.

378
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:40,332
Who?

379
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:41,900
This girl, Leah Gideon.

380
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,202
She's not a prophet.

381
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,370
I'm pretty sure she is.

382
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,820
Visions, headaches... the whole package.

383
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:49,620
The names of all the prophets...

384
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:52,367
they're seared into my brain.

385
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:54,736
Leah Gideon, is not one of them.

386
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:58,740
Then what is she?

387
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:13,240
Please, guys. Guys.

388
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:15,240
I'm not gonna tell you again.

389
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:17,759
Take a breath, both of you!

390
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:19,428
You come on my property,
spouting some kind of crazy...

391
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:21,263
I'm sorry, Paul!
There's no other way!

392
00:23:21,297 --> 00:23:22,864
Come on! What country is this, huh?

393
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,867
Need a hand, padre?

394
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:27,636
Just, everybody cool
down for a minute!

395
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,304
"Cool down," eh? My friends are
trying to run me out of town.

396
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:30,772
Do you think I should cool down?

397
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,574
I'm sorry, Paul. It is not our choice.

398
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,875
Oh, come on. That's bull.

399
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,577
You got to go...
for everyone's sake!

400
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:36,645
We grew up together.

401
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,013
I stood up at your wedding!

402
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:39,781
Yes, you did, but that was then.

403
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:41,683
And now you're
standing against the flock.

404
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:43,285
That's not true. I fight with you.

405
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,086
This is a town of believers, Paul.

406
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:46,388
You are not a believer.

407
00:23:46,422 --> 00:23:48,123
Don't make this hard for us.

408
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:51,593
Hard for you?

409
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:57,365
No.

410
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,834
This is my home.

411
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:01,136
You want me out of here?

412
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,504
You'll have to drag me out.

413
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,904
- Rob!
- Whoa, whoa! You don't wanna do this.

414
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:08,366
Get out of my...

415
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:12,869
- No, no, no.
- Everyone stop!

416
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,813
No one's gonna stop me
from seeing my son again.

417
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:21,813
Paul!

418
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:35,788
We went out looking for...

419
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:36,889
You all right?

420
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:37,957


421
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,763
Yeah, it's... it's not my blood.

422
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:46,031
- Paul's dead.
- What?!

423
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:46,132


424
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,133
- Jane shot him.
- It's starting.

425
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,635


426
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:49,802
What's starting? Where the hell

427
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:50,970
have you been?

428
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,605
On a bender.

429
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,008
- Did he... did you say "on a bender"?
- Yeah.

430
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,643
He's still pretty smashed.

431
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:58,978
It is not of import.

432
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:01,247
We need to talk
about what's happening here.

433
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:02,815
Well, I'm all ears.

434
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,318
Well, for starters...

435
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:07,153
Leah is not a real prophet.

436
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:10,356
Well, what is she, exactly?

437
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:11,557
The whore.

438
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,993
Wow. Cass, tell us
what you really think.

439
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:16,896
She rises when Lucifer walks the earth.

440
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,334
"and she shall come,
bearing false prophecy."

441
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:24,871
This creature has the power
to take a humans form,

442
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,206
read minds.

443
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,575
Book of revelation calls her
"The whore of Babylon."

444
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:29,976
Well, that's catchy.

445
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,245
The real Leah was
probably killed months ago.

446
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:33,645
What about the demons
attacking the town?

447
00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:35,437
They're under her control.

448
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:36,739
And the enochian exorcism?

449
00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:37,740
Fake.

450
00:25:37,774 --> 00:25:39,208
It actually means

451
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:42,711
"you, um, breed with
the mouth of a goat."

452
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:50,452
It's funnier in enochian.

453
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:52,822
So the demons smoking
out... that's just a con?

454
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:54,290
Why, what's the endgame?

455
00:25:54,324 --> 00:25:55,558
What you just saw...

456
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:57,426
innocent blood spilled in god's name.

457
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,061
You heard all that heaven talk.

458
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:00,996
She manipulates people.

459
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:04,033
To slaughter and kill
and sing peppy little hymns.

460
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:06,936
Awesome.

461
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,805
Her goal is to condemn as many
souls to hell as possible,

462
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,741
and it's... just beginning.

463
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:14,009
She's well on her way

464
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:16,445
to dragging this whole
town into the pit.

465
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,814
All right.

466
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,283
So, then, how do
we go pimp of Babylon

467
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:22,551
all over this bitch?

468
00:26:25,222 --> 00:26:27,823
I only wanted to...

469
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:29,525
did I make it worse?

470
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,794
did I make the angels angry?

471
00:26:31,828 --> 00:26:32,795
Jane.

472
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,965
The angels... they understand.

473
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:37,299
What you did was
for the greater good.

474
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,634


475
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:39,702
Yes.

476
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:42,771
Yes.

477
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:44,173
We all liked Paul.

478
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:46,642
But he was a sinner,

479
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:48,978
and he would have
taken us down with him.

480
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,178
You saved us.

481
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,621
Thank you.

482
00:26:52,655 --> 00:26:54,823
How can that be okay?

483
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:56,625
She killed him.

484
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,427
That sin is so much greater...

485
00:26:58,461 --> 00:27:00,095
It's not a sin to strike down evil.

486
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,263
But how can the angels...

487
00:27:01,297 --> 00:27:04,266
You always taught me
we have to have faith.

488
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:09,271
The whore can be killed with that?

489
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:14,309
It's a stake made from
a cypress tree in Babylon.

490
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,411
Great. Let's ventilate her.

491
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:18,280
It's not that easy.

492
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,948
'Course not.

493
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:23,285
The whore can only be killed
by a true servant of heaven.

494
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,519
- Servant, like...
- Not you,

495
00:27:24,554 --> 00:27:26,221
or me.

496
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:28,657
Sam, of course, is an abomination.

497
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:31,860
We'll have to find someone else.

498
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:33,595
The angels...

499
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:35,530
I don't know why they've chosen us.

500
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:36,865
But they have.

501
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:39,468
And today...

502
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:41,837
today, they told me
the most important thing yet.

503
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:45,707
Tonight, at midnight...

504
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:51,279
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:54,483
It's just that we knew
this day would come,

506
00:27:54,517 --> 00:27:57,152
and it's here...

507
00:27:57,186 --> 00:27:59,154
the final judgement.

508
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,591
Now, we need to do this right.

509
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,326
We don't have much time.

510
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,827
The angels said we're not ready.

511
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,227
There are still a few elements
that need to be taken care of.

512
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:11,872
Sinners.

513
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:24,051
Now, uh, now,
everybody calm down.

514
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:26,187
Just hold on.

515
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:27,922
Leah, you're scaring
these people.

516
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,558
Now, I don't want us to panic,
but we have to hurry.

517
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,594
- Stop it.
- I've been given instructions, names.

518
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,762
Wait. Let's go.

519
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,964
What are you doing? Stop it!

520
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,065
You're gonna get somebody killed.

521
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,234
Let me go.

522
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,436
Or the next sinner
I name will be you.

523
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:09,211
Pastor David Gideon.

524
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:11,047
Yeah. Who are you?

525
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:13,582
I'm an angel of the lord.

526
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:14,817
Yeah, sure.

527
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,492
What the hell was that?

528
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:26,128
Yeah, he wasn't lying
about the angel thing.

529
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:28,330
Have a seat, padre.
We got to have a chat.

530
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,637
No.

531
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:35,938
She's my daughter.

532
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:37,406
I'm sorry, but she's not.

533
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:39,241
She's the thing that
killed your daughter.

534
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:40,242
That's impossible.

535
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:41,277
But it's true.

536
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,578
And deep down, you know it.

537
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:45,948
Look, we get it...
it's too much.

538
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,250
But if you don't do this,

539
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:49,485
she's going to kill a lot of people

540
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,920
and damn the rest to hell.

541
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:51,954
It's just...

542
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:59,360
- why does it have to be me?
- You're a servant of heaven.

543
00:29:57,694 --> 00:29:59,395


544
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:01,429
- And you're an angel.
- Poor example of one.

545
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:01,797


546
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,207
Heads up.

547
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:27,646
How many should I take?

548
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,314
You?

549
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:31,383
You should probably
just down the whole bottle.

550
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,452
Thanks.

551
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:36,354
Yeah, don't mention it.

552
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:37,923
Yeah, I've been there.

553
00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:41,126
I'm a big expert on deadbeat dads,

554
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,695
so...

555
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:45,897
Yeah, I get it.

556
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:47,799
I know how you feel.

557
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,338
How do you manage it?

558
00:30:57,777 --> 00:30:59,811
On a good day,
you get to kill a whore.

559
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:07,719
Rob, Jane, please!
Come on, it's me!

560
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:09,987
- It's Elise!
- Sorry. Really.

561
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:10,221


562
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:11,923
But you know
we have to do this.

563
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:15,126
We're putting them
in the storage unit.

564
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:18,830
No! No!

565
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:23,341
- No, please.
- You're wrong.

566
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:29,341
- Jane, is that everyone?
- Yeah.

567
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:31,943
Okay, then.

568
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:34,245
Get the kerosene.

569
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:40,875
What?

570
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,577
There are kids in there.

571
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,515
The angels named
them for a reason.

572
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:51,218
Jane...

573
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:54,688
your son needs you to do this.

574
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:24,785
Daddy! Don't hurt me!

575
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,853
Gideon, now!

576
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:27,555


577
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:37,297
Gideon! Wait, no!

578
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,599


579
00:32:40,402 --> 00:32:42,736
Help me! He's a demon!

580
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:50,744
Light the kerosene.

581
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,644
Come on! Come on!

582
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,931
Please. Like you're
a servant of heaven.

583
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,733
Let me go!

584
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,568
This is why my team's gonna win.

585
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,069
You're the great vessel?

586
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,773
You're pathetic, self-hating, and faithless.

587
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,475
It's the end of the world.

588
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,011
And you're just gonna sit back
and watch it happen.

589
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,518
Don't be so sure, whore.

590
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,580
But, uh... I don't understand...

591
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:21,180
how are we supposed to
get to paradise now?

592
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:24,216
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:24,217 --> 00:34:27,486
Pretty sure you're headed
in a different direction

594
00:34:30,223 --> 00:34:31,857
Gotcha.

595
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:34,093
Come on.

596
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:35,094
Yeah.

597
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:48,241
Dean, how did you do that?

598
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:49,308
What?

599
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:50,343
Kill her.

600
00:34:50,377 --> 00:34:52,845
Long run of luck held out, I guess.

601
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:55,681
Last I checked, she
could only be ganked

602
00:34:55,716 --> 00:34:56,816
by a servant of heaven.

603
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,518
Well, what do you
want me to tell you?

604
00:34:58,552 --> 00:35:00,419
I saw a shot, I went for it.

605
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:03,855
All right. Here we go.

606
00:35:04,424 --> 00:35:06,459
Watch your head, now.

607
00:35:08,762 --> 00:35:10,329
Are you gonna do
something stupid?

608
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:11,264
Like what?

609
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:13,065
Like Michael stupid.

610
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,668
Come on, Sam.
Give me a break.

611
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,445
How's the head?

612
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,880
I'm seeing double.

613
00:35:27,915 --> 00:35:30,550
But that may be the painkillers.

614
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:31,951
You'll be okay.

615
00:35:32,584 --> 00:35:33,951
No.

616
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:46,855
Where you going?

617
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,657
I'm just gonna grab some clan
bandages out of the trunk.

618
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:49,658
Relax.

619
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:59,958
Hold it right there. How's that?

620
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:05,607
Damn it! Dean!

621
00:36:06,853 --> 00:36:07,456
Dean!

622
00:36:56,353 --> 00:36:57,856
Dean?

623
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:00,507
Hi, Lisa.

624
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,578
I didn't have your number, uh, so...

625
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:05,846
No. No, it's okay.

626
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,149
I'm... I'm... Just surprised.

627
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:12,419
How's Ben?

628
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:15,021
Good.

629
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:17,124
Good. He's at baseball.

630
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:19,916
You moved.

631
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,019
It's a... nice house.

632
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:25,054
Dean, you didn't come
all the way here

633
00:37:25,088 --> 00:37:26,622
to talk about real estate.

634
00:37:28,025 --> 00:37:29,325
You all right?

635
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:33,829
No, not really.

636
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:37,633
What is it

637
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,374
Look, I have no illusions, okay?

638
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,578
I know the life that I live...

639
00:37:48,612 --> 00:37:51,113
I know how that's
gonna end for me.

640
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:55,017
Whatever. I'm okay with that.

641
00:37:55,052 --> 00:37:56,786
But I wanted you to know...

642
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:00,890
that when I do
picture myself happy...

643
00:38:03,226 --> 00:38:04,660
it's with you...

644
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:09,065
and the kid.

645
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:15,037
Wow.

646
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:16,872
I mean, you don't
have to say anything.

647
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:18,541
No, I... I mean, I know.

648
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:19,742
I know.

649
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:21,410
I want to.

650
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:24,914
Come inside. Let
me get you a beer.

651
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:25,982
I wish I could.

652
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,324
Take care of yourself, Lisa.

653
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,324
No, no. Wait, wait.

654
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,218
You can't just drop a bombshell
like that and then leave.

655
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:43,355
I know.

656
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,623
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:47,892
But I don't have a choice.

658
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:50,028
Yeah, you do. You do.

659
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:52,364
You can come inside and let me
get you a beer. We can talk.

660
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:53,665
Lisa, wait a minute.

661
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:58,336
Things are about to get really bad.

662
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:00,639
Like how?

663
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,842
Like your kind of bad?

664
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:05,210
Worse.

665
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:07,045
Next few days, the crap
you're gonna see on your TV,

666
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,680
it' s gonna be
down right trippy.

667
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,181
Scary.

668
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,549
But I don't want you to worry,

669
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:14,119
because I'm making
arrangements for you and Ben.

670
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:15,253
Arrangements?

671
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:16,888
Whatever happens,
you're gonna be okay.

672
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,156
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

673
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,357
The people that I'm gonna see next,

674
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:20,625
they're not gonna
get anything from me

675
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,494
without agreeing
to a few conditions.

676
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25,997
Just... just come inside, please.

677
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,266
And whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't do it.

678
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:31,569
I have to.

679
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:33,972
Just stay an hour.

680
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:35,774
At least say bye to Ben.

681
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:42,881
Ah, it's better if I don't.

682
00:39:59,822 --> 00:40:00,922
Good-bye, Lisa.
