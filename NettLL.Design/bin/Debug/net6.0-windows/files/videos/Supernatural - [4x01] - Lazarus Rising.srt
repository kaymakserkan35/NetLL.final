Sam: so,this is Ruby,huh?

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,340
Dean: she's a demon,Sam.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,230
Ruby: her name is Lilith.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,230
She doesn't like you very much.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,680
How long did they give you?
One year.

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,890
[ac/dc's "you shook me all night long"]

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,970
Did you know? About Dean's deal?

8
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,300
That Lilith holds the contract?
Yes.

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,820
You got two months left,Dean.
You're not gonna go to hell.

10
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,430
It's not Ruby. It's Lilith!

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,480
Where's Ruby?

12
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,670
I sent her far,far away.

13
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,270
Sic him,boy.

14
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,780
Somebody help me!

15
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,830
Sam!

16
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,550
Help!

17
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,750

You have reached a number

26
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,750
Bobby?
Yeah.

27

It's me.
Who's "me"?

Who is this?

30
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,510
Bobby,listen to me.

31
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
This ain't funny.
Call again and I'll kill you.

32
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,390
Surprise.

33
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't...

Bobby,it's me!

38
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,920
My ass.

39
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,230
Whoa,whoa,whoa! Wait!

40
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,720
Your name is robert steven singer.

41
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,250
You became a hunter after
your wife got possessed.

42
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,650
You're about the closest
thing I have to a father.

43
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,850
Bobby...it's me.

44
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,310
Whoa!

45
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,900
I am not a shapeshifter.

46
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,380
Then you're a revenant!

47
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,340
All right.

48
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,870
If I was either,would I do
this with a silver knife?

49
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
Dean?

50
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,490
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

51
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,800
It's -- It's good
to see you,boy.

52
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,980
Yeah,you too.

53
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,610
But...

54
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,170
How did you bust out?

55
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,060
I don't know.

56
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,550
I just,uh...

57
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,220
Just woke up
in a pine bo--

58
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,470
I'm not a demon,either, you know.

59
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,600
Sorry.

60
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,370
Can't be too careful.

61
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,520
That don't make a lick of sense.

62
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,530
Yeah. Yeah,you're
preaching to the choir.

63
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,040
Dean,your chest was ribbons,
your insides were slop,

64
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,140
And you'd been buried four months.

65
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,290

hell and back into your meats --</i>

66
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,960
I know. I should look like
a "thriller" video reject.

67
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,920
What do you remember?

68
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,340
Not much.

69
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,050
I remember I was a
hellhound's chew toy...

70
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,100
And then lights-Out.

71
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,400
Then I come to six feet under.
That was it.

72
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,890
Sam's number's not working.

73
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,410
He's,uh --
He's not...

74
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,330
Oh,he's alive, as far as I know.

75
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,270
Good.

76
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,040
Wait. What do you mean
-- as far as you know?

77
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,840
I haven't talked to him for months.

78
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,590
You're kidding? You just
let him go off by himself?

79
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,330
He was dead set on it.

80
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,920
Bobby,you should have
been looking after him.

81
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:19,840
I tried.

82
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,240
These last months
haven't been exactly easy,

83
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,830
<i>You know,for him or me.</i>

84
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,400
We had to bury you.

85
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,190
Why did you bury me, anyway?

86
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,070
I wanted you salted and
burned -- Usual drill --

87
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,540
But Sam wouldn't have it.

88
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,980
Well,I'm glad he won that one.

89
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,450
He said you'd need a body when
he got you back home somehow.

90
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,000
That's about all he said.
What do you mean?

91
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,200
He was quiet...

92
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,620
Real quiet.

93
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,240
Then he just took off.
Wouldn't return my calls.

94
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,090
I tried to find him, but
he don't want to be found.

95
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,820
Oh,damn it,Sammy.

96
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,170
What?

97
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,660
Oh,he got me home okay.

98
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,950
But whatever he did, it is bad mojo.

99
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,780
What makes you so sure?
You should have seen the grave site.

100
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,130
It was like a nuke went off.

101
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,420
Then there was this --
this force,this presence,

102
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,110
That,I don't know,

103
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,440
But it -- It -- It blew
past me at a fill-Up joint.

104
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,260
And then this.

105
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,880
What in the hell?

106
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,660
Yeah,it's like a demon just
yanked me out or rode me out.

107
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,390
But why?

108
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,050
To hold up their end of the bargain.

109
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,440
You think Sam made a deal?

110
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,670
It's what I would have done.

111
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,150
Yeah,hi.

112
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,960
I have a,uh,cellphone
account with you guys

113
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,760
And,uh,lost my phone.

114
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,860
I was wondering if you
could turn the gps on for me.

115
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,870
Yeah. The name's "wedge antilles."

Thank you.

118
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,380
How'd you know he'd use that name?

I know about that kid?</i>

What's the deal with
the liquor store,hmm?

122
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,680
Your parents out of town or something?

123
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,990
Like I said,

124
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,650
The last few months
ain't been all that easy.

125
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:16,970
Right.

126
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,580
Sam's in pontiac, illinois.

127
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,150
Right near where you were planted.

128
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,330
Right where I popped up.

129
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,760
Hell of a coincidence, don't you think?

130

[ Mid-Tempo music plays faintly ]

131
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,240
So,where is it?

132
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,180
Where's what?

two guys to deliver.

Hey,ya,Sammy.

Aaah!

138
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,440
Who are you?!

139
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,270
Like you didn't do this!
Do what?!

140
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,530
It's him. It's him,Sam.

<i>I've been through this already.
It's really him.</i>

142

But...

143
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,570
I know.

144

00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,350
So,are you two,like... together?

146

What? No.

No.

O-Oh.

150
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,180
Got it... I-I guess.

151
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
Look,I should probably go.

a good idea. Sorry.

Right.

157

So,tell me, what'd it cost?

159
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,710
I don't pay,Dean.

160

That's not funny,Sam.

161
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,990
To bring me back.

162
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,110
What'd it cost?

163
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,500
Was it just your soul,
or was it something worse?

164
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,300
You think I made a deal?
That's exactly what we think.

165
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,100
Well,I didn't.

166
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,930
Don't lie to me.

167
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm not lying.

168
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,510
So,what now?

169
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,450
I'm off the hook, and
you're on,is that it?

170
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,760
You're some demon's bitch boy?

171
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,570
I didn't want to be saved like this.

00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,350
Look,Dean,I wish
I had done it,all right?

173
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,760
There's no other way that
this could have gone down.

174
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,490
Now tell the truth!

175
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
I tried everything. That's the truth.

176
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,920
I tried opening the devil's gate.

177
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,470
Hell,I tried to bargain, Dean,

178
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,040
But no demon would deal, all right?

179
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,750
You were rotting in hell
for months -- For months --

180
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,990
And I couldn't stop it.

181
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,130
So,I'm sorry it wasn't me,all right?

182
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,200
Dean,I'm sorry.

183
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
It's okay,Sammy.

184
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,130
You don't have to apologize.
I believe you.

185
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,350
Don't get me wrong --

186
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,280
I am gladdened that
Sam's soul remains intact,

187
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,560
But that does raise a sticky question.

188
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,380
If he didn't pull me out, then what did?

189
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,980
So,what were you doing around here

190
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,880
If you weren't digging me out of my grave?
Once I figured out I couldn't save you,

191
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,870
Um...I started hunting down Lilith,

192
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,880
Trying to get some payback.

193
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,890
Bobby: all by yourself?

194
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,220
Who do you think you are, your old man?

195
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,330
Uh...

196
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,190
Yeah,I'm sorry,Bobby.

197
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:26,920
I-I should have called.

198
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,470
I was pretty messed up.

199
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,720
Oh,yeah. I really feel your pain.

200
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,880
Anyways,uh,I was checking
these demons out of tennessee,

201
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,650
And out of nowhere they took
a hard left,booked up here.

202
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,000
When? Yesterday morning.

203
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,650
When I busted out.

204
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,380
You think these demons
are here 'cause of you?

205
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,890
But why?

206
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,080
Well,I don't know.

207
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,490
Some badass demon drags
me out, and now this?

208
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,790
It's got to be connected somehow.

209
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,760
How you feeling,anyway?

210
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,970
I'm a little hungry.

211
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,580
No,I mean, do you feel like yourself?

212
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,890
Anything strange or different?
Or demonic?

213
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
Bobby,how many times do
I have to prove I'm me?

214
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,950
Yeah,well,listen -- No
demon's letting you loose

215
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,400
Out of the goodness of their hearts.

216
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,380
They got to have
something nasty planned.

217
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,980
Well,I feel fine. Okay,look,we
don't know what they're planning.

218
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,900
We got a pile of
questions and no shovel.

219
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,000
We need help.

220
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,850
I know a psychic a few hours from here.

221
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,310
Something this big,maybe she's
heard the other side talking.

222
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,790
Hell,yeah. It's worth a shot.
I'll be right back.

223
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,640
Hey,wait.

224
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,800
You probably want this back.

225
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,570
Thanks.

226
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,720
Don't mention it.

227
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,290
Hey,Dean, what was it like?

228
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
What? Hell?

229
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,990
I don't know. I-I-I-I
must have blacked it out.

230
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,880
I don't remember a damn thing.

231
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,540
Thank god for that.

232
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,260
Yeah.

233
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,350
She's about four hours
down the interstate.

234
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,520
Try to keep up.

235
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,030
I assume you'll want to drive.

236
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,260
I almost forgot.

237
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,980
Hey,sweetheart, did you miss me?

238
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,510
Oh...

239
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,080
What the hell is that?
That's an ipod jack.

240
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,500
You were supposed to take
care of her,not douche her up.

241
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,330
Dean, I thought it was my car.

242
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,140
Really?

243
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,890
There still one thing
that's bothering me.

244
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,620
Yeah?

245
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,070
Yeah. The night that I bit
it -- Or got bit.

246
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,660
How'd you make it out? I thought
Lilith was gonna kill you.

247
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,020
Well,she tried. She couldn't.

248
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,140
What do you mean she couldn't?

249
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,730
She fired this,like,
burning light at me,

250
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,840
And... it didn't leave a scratch,

251
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,230
Like I was immune or something.

252
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,400
Immune?

253
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,100
Yeah.

254
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,210
I don't know who was more
surprised -- Her or me.

255
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,950
she left pretty fast after that.

256
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,730
Huh.

257
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,020
What about Ruby? Where is she?

258
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,590
Dead or in hell.

259
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,040
So,you been using
your,uh,freaky E.S.P. Stuff?

260
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,080
No.

261
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,020
Sure about that?

262
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,870
Ah,well,I mean, now
that you got immunity --

263
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,530
Whatever the hell that
is -- Just wondering

264
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,180
What other kind of weirdo
crap you got going on.

265
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,250
Nothing,Dean.

266
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,140
Look,you didn't want
me to go down that road,

267
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,750
So I didn't go down that road.

268
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,590
It was practically your dying wish.

269
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,360
Yeah,well, let's keep it that way.

270
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,000
Bobby!

271
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,960
Rrrrr!

272
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,600
Bobby: you're a sight for sore eyes.

273
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,800
So,are these the boys?

274
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,240
Sam,Dean --
Pamela Barnes.

275
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,980
Best damn psychic in the state.

276
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,310
Hey.
Hi.

277
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,940
Mmm,mmm,mmm.

278
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,640
Dean Winchester.

279
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,170
Out of the fire and back
in the frying pan,huh?

280
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,040
Makes you a rare individual.

281
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,850
If you say so.

282
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,930
Come on in.

283
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,670
So,you hear anything?

284
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,760
Well,I ouija-Ed my way
through a dozen spirits.

285
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,380
No one seems to know who
broke your boy out or why.

286
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,440
So,what's next?

287
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,550
See if we can see who did the deed.

288
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,870
You're not gonna summon
the damn thing here?

289
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,690
No.

290
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,660
I just want to get a sneak peek at it,

291
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,550
Like a crystal ball without the crystal.

292
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,980
I'm game.

293
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,100
Who's jesse?

294
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,770
Well,it wasn't forever.

295
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,380
His loss.

296
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,310
Might be your gain.

297
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,820
Dude,I'm so in.

298
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,320
Yeah,she's gonna eat you alive.

299
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,660
Hey,I just got out of jail. Bring it.

300
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,690
You're invited,too, grumpy.

301
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,350
<i>You are not invited.</i>

302
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,400
Take each other's hands.

303
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,440
And I need to touch something

304
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,130
Our mystery monster touched.

305
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Whoa! Well,he didn't touch me there.</i>

306
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,090
My mistake.

307
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:45,670
Okay.

308
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,730
I invoke,conjure,
and command you --

309
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,650
Appear unto me before this circle.

310
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,260
I invoke,conjure,
and command you --

311
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,320
Appear unto me before this circle.

312
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,170
I invoke,conjure,
and command you --

313
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,080
Appear unto me before this circle.

314
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,780
I invoke --

315
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,640
Castiello?

316
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,460
No. Sorry,castiello, I don't scare easy.

317
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,310
Castiello? Its name.

318
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,330
It's whispering to me,
warning me to turn back.

319
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,540
I conjure and command
you -- Show me your face.

320
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,440
I conjure and command
you -- Show me your face.

321
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,050
I conjure and command
you -- Show me your face.

322
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,720
I conjure and command you
-- Maybe we should stop.

323
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:30,810
I almost got it.

324
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,680
I command you --
Show me your face.

325
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,680
Show me your face now!

326
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,860
Aaah!

327
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,430
Call 911

328
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,820
I can't see.

329
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,140
...water street. Please hurry.

330
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,700
oh,god,no.

331
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:07,930
What'd Bobby say?

332
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,540
What'd Bobby say?

333
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,800
Uh,pam's stable and out of icu.

334
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,670
And blind 'cause of us?

335
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,690
And we still have no clue
what we're dealing with.

336
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,400
That's not entirely true.
No?

337
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,260
We got a name --
Castiello or whatever.

338
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,830
With the rto us.

339
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,580
You're crazy. Absolutely not.

340
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,500
We'll work him over.
I mean,after what he did?

341
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,990
Pam took a peek at him and her
eyes burned out of her skull,

342
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,250
And you want to
have a face-To-Face?

343
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,440
You got a better idea?
Yeah,as a matter of fact,I do.

344
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,720
I followed some demons to town,right?
Okay?

345
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,590
So we go find them.

346
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,890
Someone's got to know
something about something.

347
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,280
Thanks.

348
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,760
You angling for a tip?

349
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,190
I'm sorry. I thought
you were looking for us.

350
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:10,980
Dean...

351
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,540
To hell and back.

352
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:16,208
Aren't you a lucky duck?

353
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,438
That's me.

354
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:20,441
So,you get to just stroll
out of the pit,huh?

355
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:23,929
<i>Tell me, what makes
you so special?</i>

356
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,841
I like to think it's because
of my perky nipples.

357
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:30,607
I don't know.

358
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,631
It wasn't my doing. I don't
know who pulled me out.

359
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:35,425
Right. You don't.

360
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,859
No,I don't.

361
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,903
Lying's a sin,you know.

362
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:43,904
I'm not lying.

363
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:46,899
But I'd like to find out.

364
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:49,700
So if you wouldn't mind
enlightening me,flo.

365
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:52,315
Mind your tone with me,boy.

366
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:54,509
I'll drag you back to hell myself.

367
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:02,446
No,you won't.

368
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:04,002
-No?
-No.

369
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:05,896
'Cause if you were,
you'd have done it already.

370
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:08,583
The fact is, you don't
know who cut me loose.

371
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:11,368
And you're just as spooked as we are.

372
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,351
And you're looking for answers.

373
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:18,721
Well,maybe it was some
turbocharged spirit,hmm?

374
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,945
Or,uh,godzilla.

375
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:23,133
Or some big,bad boss demon.

376
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,972
But I'm guessing at your pay grade

377
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:26,786
That they don't tell you squat.

378
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:28,708
'Cause whoever it was,

379
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:31,235
<i>They want me out...</i>

380
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,395
And they're a lot stronger than you.

381
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,654
So,go ahead. Send me back.

382
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:39,472
But don't come crawling to me

383
00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:40,920
When they show up on your front doorstep

384
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,247
With some vaseline and a fire hose.

385
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,539
I'm gonna reach down your
throat and rip out your lungs.

386
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,582
That's what I thought.

387
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:08,383
Let's go,Sam.

388
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,299
For the pie.

389
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,918
Holy crap, that was close.

390
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:36,359
We're not just gonna leave
them in there,are we,Dean?

391
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,968
Well,yeah. There's three
of them,probably more.

392
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,631
We only got one
knife between us.

393
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:41,101
I've been killing a lot more
demons than that lately.

394
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:44,107
Not anymore. The smarter
brother's back in town.

395
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,691
Dean,we got to take them.
They are dangerous.

396
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:48,665
They're scared,okay?

397
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,672
Scared of whatever had
the juice to yank me out.

398
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:53,822
We're dealing with a bad
mofo here. One job at a time.

399
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,269
Dean!

400
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:56,398
How you doing,kid?

401
00:30:57,076 --> 00:30:59,497
Aside from the church bells
s ringing in my head...

402
00:30:59,497 --> 00:31:01,126
Peachy.

403
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:11,104
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

404
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,872
Couldn't sleep.
Went to get a burger.

405
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,919
-In my car?
- Force of habit,sorry. What are you doing up?

406
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,762
Well,uh,Bobby's back.
We're going to grab a beer.

407
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:23,922
All right. Well,uh,
spill some for me,huh?

408
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:26,091
Done. Yeah, I'll catch you later.

409
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:36,500
Why the hell didn't you tell him?

410
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,243
'Cause he'd just try to stop us.

411
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:40,567
-From what?
-Summoning this thing.

412
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,923
It's time we face it head on.

413
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:45,621
-You can't be serious.
- As a heart attack.

414
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,369
It's high noon,baby.

415
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:49,778
We don't know what it is.

416
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,426
I-It could be a demon.
It could be anything.

417
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:53,758
That's why we got to be
ready for anything.

418
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:58,038
We got the big-Time magic knife.

419
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:00,373
You got an arsenal in the trunk.

420
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:02,356
This is a bad idea.

421
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:04,971
I couldn't agree more,but
what other choice do we have?

422
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:06,243
We could choose life.

423
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:08,085
Bobby,whatever this is,
whatever it wants,

424
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:10,368
It's after me -- That much we know,right?

425
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:11,767
Well,I got no place to hide.

426
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:14,166
I can either get caught
with my pants down again,

427
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,172
Or we can make our stand.

428
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:18,987
Dean,we could use Sam for this.

429
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:20,943
Nah,he's better off where he is.

430
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:37,583
Your eyes.

431
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,744
I could still smell your soul a mile away.

432
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:43,631
Who was here? You saw it.

433
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:44,991
I saw it.

434
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,714
What was it?

435
00:33:48,597 --> 00:33:49,969
It's the end.

436
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:51,944
We're dead. We're all dead.

437
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:53,975
What did you see?

438
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:56,841
Go to hell.

439
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:00,890
Funny...

440
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,422
I was gonna say the
same thing to you.

441
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:56,219
Deam it.

442
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:03,192
Getting pretty slick there,Sam.
Better all the time.

443
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,694
What the hell's going
on around here,Ruby?

444
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:17,002
I wish I knew.

445
00:35:17,676 --> 00:35:19,974
We were thinking some
high-Level demon pulled Dean out.

446
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:21,262
No way.

447
00:35:21,262 --> 00:35:23,935
Sam,human souls don't
just walk out of hell

448
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:25,377
And back into their bodies easy.

449
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:28,493
This guy bleeds, the ground quakes --

450
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,429
It's cosmic.

451
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:34,086
No demon can swing that.

452
00:35:34,086 --> 00:35:36,046
Not Lilith...

453
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:38,428
Not anybody.

454
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,876
Then what can?

455
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:42,927
Nothing I've ever seen before.

456
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,180
That's a hell of an art project
you got going there.

457
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,649
Traps and talismans from
every faith on the globe.

458
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:03,449
How you doing?

459
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:06,137
Stakes,iron,silver,salt, a knife --

460
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:07,212
I mean, we're pretty much set

461
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,572
To catch and kill anything I've ever heard of.

462
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:11,299
This is still a bad idea.

463
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,679
Yeah,Bobby,I heard
you the first 10 times.

464
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:16,707
What do you say we
ring the dinner bell?

465
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:34,210
<i>Amate spiritus obscure...</i>

466
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,892
So,million-Dollar question --

467
00:36:36,892 --> 00:36:38,943
You gonna tell Dean
about what we're doing?

468
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:42,705
Yeah,I just got to figure
out the right way to say it.

469
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:46,787
look,I just need time,okay?
That's all.

470
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,026
Sam,he's gonna find out, and if it's not
from you, he's gonna be pissed.

471
00:36:50,026 --> 00:36:51,513
Oh,he's gonna be pissed anyway.

472
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,603
He's so hardheaded about
this psychic stuff,

473
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:54,644
He'll just try and stop me.

474
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:58,953
Look,maybe I'll just take
a step back for a while.

475
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:02,365
-Ruby --
-I mean,I'm not exactly in your brother's fan club,

476
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:06,470
But he is your brother,and
I'm not gonna come between you.

477
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,824
I don't know if what I'm doing is right.

478
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:10,705
Hell,I don't even know if I trust you.

479
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:13,611
- Thanks.
-What I do know is I'm saving people...

480
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,294
And stopping demons.

481
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,686
And that feels good.

482
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,101
I want to keep going.

483
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:40,748
You sure you did the ritual right?

484
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:43,541
Sorry.

485
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,652
Touchy,touchy,huh?

486
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:06,012
Wishful thinking,
but maybe it's just the wind.

487
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,010
Who are you?

488
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,363
I'm the one who gripped you tight

489
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,163
And raised you from perdition.

490
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:49,610
Yeah. Thanks for that.

491
00:39:16,714 --> 00:39:18,383
We need to talk,Dean.

492
00:39:20,098 --> 00:39:21,342
Alone.

493
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:33,241
Your friend is alive.

494
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:34,529
Who are you?

495
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:35,379
Castiello.

496
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:38,635
<i>Yeah,I figured that much.
I mean what are you?</i>

497
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,966
I'm an angel of the lord.

498
00:39:49,581 --> 00:39:51,204
Get the hell out of here.

499
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:53,866
There's no such thing.

500
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:59,438
This is your problem,Dean.

501
00:39:59,768 --> 00:40:01,962
You have no faith.

502
00:40:17,055 --> 00:40:18,855
Some angel you are.

503
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:21,946
You burned out that
poor woman's eyes.

504
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:26,260
I warned her not to
spy on my true form.

505
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,614
It can be overwhelming to humans

506
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:32,286
And so can my real voice...
but you already knew that.

507
00:40:32,286 --> 00:40:35,158
You mean the gas
station and the motel?

508
00:40:35,997 --> 00:40:37,874
That was you talking?

509
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,249
Buddy,next time,
lower the volume.

510
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:43,399
That was my mistake.

511
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,619
Certain people -- Special people --

512
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,184
Can perceive my true visage.

513
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:49,160
I thought you would be one of them.

514
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,775
I was wrong.

515
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,111
And what visage are you in now,huh?

516
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:54,999
What -- Holy tax accountant?

517
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:58,625
This? This is...a vessel.

518
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,960
You're possessing some poor bastard?

519
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,015
He's a devout man.
He actually prayed for this.

520
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:05,497
Look,pal,I'm not buying what you're selling.

521
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,445
So who are you,really?

522
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:10,414
I told you.

523
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:12,260
Right.

524
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:16,851
And why would an angel
rescue me from hell?

525
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:21,097
Good things do happen,Dean.

526
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:25,399
Not in my experience.

527
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:27,759
What's the matter?

528
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:34,076
You don't think you
deserve to be saved.

529
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,243
Why'd you do it?

530
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:44,509
Because god commanded it.

531
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:49,492
Because we have work for you.

532
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:55,581
