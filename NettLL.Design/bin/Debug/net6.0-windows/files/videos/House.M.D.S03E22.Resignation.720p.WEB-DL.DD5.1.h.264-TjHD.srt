1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,070
(BOTH GRUNTING)

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,170
She almost took my head off.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,140
Your fault.
You didn't guard
your left side.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,080
Point.

5
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,540
Stop, stop, stop!

6
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,010
Addie, you're bleeding.

7
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,150
I never even hit her.

8
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,920
Good morning.

9
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,030
This is funny. People don't...

10
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,260
Not done reading. Go away.

11
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,530
Most likely,
she coughed it up.

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,830
Which would mean
it's from her lungs.
Drugs, toxins, infection...

13
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,570
No fever and
no elevated white count.
Which rules out infection.

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,510
And blood panels
found no drugs, no toxins.

15
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,600
The bronchoscopy was pristine.
So much for the lungs.

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,480
Good morning.
Not yet.

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,910
So then, the blood came
from her stomach.

18
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,950
Which would mean
it's an ulcer or a GI bleed.

19
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,850
ER also did an upper
and lower GI.
No <i>occult</i> blood in her stool.

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,750
Which means no ulcer
or GI bleed.

21
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,420
Which means it's not from
the stomach, either.

22
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,050
Which means it didn't
come from anywhere.

23
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,760
You guys get to the point
where the blood didn't
come from anywhere?

24
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,560
Rupture in her sinus cavity?
Drip through the back?

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,700
Not that much blood.
Trauma from karate?

26
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,100
No trauma. She kicked
the other guy's ass.

27
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,440
Now a good time?

28
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,880
If you can tell me how blood
can mysteriously
appear in a...

29
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,470
Now. This includes you.

30
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,650
What's going on?

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,710
Feel free to speculate
amongst yourselves.

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,560
Are you sure?
Yeah.

33
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,650
Why?

34
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,320
He's afraid of
turning into me.

35
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,700
Well, that's a
good enough reason.

36
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,330
Sign here.

37
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,870
Doesn't look promising.

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,170
Good luck.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,040
Thank you.
That's it?

40
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,840
You're not going to tell him
that we're a family

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,610
and families don't
abandon each other?

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,340
You want me to?
No.

43
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,250
Would it make any difference?
No.

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,650
Good luck, Dr. Foreman.

45
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,090
So, where were we?

46
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,260
College sophomore
coughing up blood.

47
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,140
Not the case. The speculation.
The palace intrigue.
The rising self-doubts.

48
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,510
HOUSE: Did Foreman
get a promotion?

49
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,910
I resigned.

50
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,140
What?

51
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,450
Personally, I can't believe
I've had the same three
employees for three years.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,040
Patient could have
a heart problem.

53
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,290
Yes. Life goes on.
Look at the eager beaver
combing his hair.

54
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,200
Hyper-dynamic heart
could force too much blood
into her lungs.

55
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,530
She coughed up the overflow.

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,440
Wouldn't leave a trace in her
lungs because it's traveling
through normal plumbing.

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,560
Foreman,
go do a stress echo test
to see if he's right.

58
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,270
Cameron? Check out the dorm,
then re-do the ER labs.

59
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,680
I'll get going on
Foreman's farewell party.

60
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,340
Everybody good
with a "Mermaid Under
the Stars" theme?

61
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,020
So, why are you leaving?

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,130
Or is it just
some sort of power play?

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,930
You can have my parking space,
my locker.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,670
Is it about House?

65
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,270
Let me get all sensitive
and confide in you.

66
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,510
Addie? Pedal harder.
Need your heart rate at 170.

67
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,810
Why wouldn't you
want to tell me?

68
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,280
I don't like you.
Never have. Never will.

69
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,680
You want me to
share some more?

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,630
Even if you do hate me,
if you'd found another job,
you'd tell me.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,150
If House did something
to drive you out of here,
you'd tell me.

72
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,690
The fact that you won't
tell me means that
whatever the real reason is

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,330
you're ashamed of it.

74
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,100
ADDIE: Guys? I'm at 170.

75
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,420
Pulmonary artery looks good.
It's not a heart problem.

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,750
Are you cold?
No.

77
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,230
Scared?
I'm okay. Why?

78
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,830
On your arm.

79
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,540
Addie has goose bumps.

80
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,140
No recovering
from those babies.

81
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,510
You don't have goose bumps
for no reason.

82
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,450
They're a reaction
to the body thinking
it's cold.

83
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,080
She wasn't cold.
Her temperature was normal.

84
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,090
But her body thought it was.
Which means...

85
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,850
What? A brain problem?

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,980
A messed up hypothalamus
could cause goose bumps

87
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,080
but they're not going to
cause her to cough up blood.

88
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,190
She has no neurological
issues. She had a shiver.

89
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,460
I think there's an infection.

90
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,230
We've ruled out infection
because no fever,
no white count.

91
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,170
I think there's an infection.

92
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,640
Blood goes where it's needed.
Infection likes nice,
wet places. Her lungs.

93
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,010
Start treatment. All that cool
stuff for bacterial, fungal,
and atypical infections.

94
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,040
Get a lung biopsy.
I want to see the
little bugger up close.

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,180
Why is Foreman quitting?

96
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,480
He wants to breed llamas.

97
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,860
Interesting.

98
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,900
You're ashamed
of the reason, too.

99
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,880
No one writes tamoxifen
like you.

100
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,180
Well, I use a "G."

101
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,080
Foreman resigned.

102
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,950
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,680
It's okay. No biggie.

104
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,490
Right. He give a reason?

105
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,790
He said he didn't want to
end up like me.
I had a brilliant retort.

106
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,200
I can't remember
what it was at the moment.

107
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,900
You don't want to
end up like you.

108
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,800
Good point. Can I resign?

109
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,170
What's up with that?

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
With what?
You yawned.

111
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,450
I just told you
something interesting,
so you're not bored.

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,210
It's 11:00 in the morning,
you're drinking coffee,
so you're not tired.

113
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,220
I didn't yawn, so it's not
a mirror-neuron reaction.

114
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,420
Which leaves symptom.
Vasovagal issue,
maybe a heart problem.

115
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,290
My heart's fine.
I was up late.

116
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,960
You're just deflecting
having a conversation
about Foreman.

117
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,730
I'm okay with Foreman leaving.

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,100
Either you're lying,
or you don't really think
he's leaving

119
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,140
or you just jumped
right to acceptance.

120
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,100
I'm sorry. I yawned
because I was trying to
communicate boredom.

121
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,840
You could try bargaining
with him. Give him a raise.

122
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,480
How much do you think
it would cost to make him
want to be like me?

123
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,390
Thanks for the coffee.

124
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,360
She seems fine.

125
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,550
She is fine.
She coughed up blood.

126
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,430
Past tense.
She has diarrhea.

127
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,020
From the antibiotics
for the infection.

128
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,230
Lung biopsy says
she doesn't have an infection.

129
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,700
Well, then, you screwed up
the biopsy.

130
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,400
Or you're wrong
about infection.

131
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,200
If I'm wrong,
then so is her body.

132
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,940
Because it obviously thinks
she's got an infection,

133
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,670
or it wouldn't have
gotten better
from the antibiotics.

134
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,870
What is pandiculation
symptomatic of?

135
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,010
Yawning is a symptom
of fatigue or
cholinergic excitation.

136
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,380
Does this have anything
to do with Addie?

137
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,680
Let's say yes.

138
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,620
Cerebral tumor, epilepsy...

139
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,320
Could also be a medication
reaction to antidepressants

140
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,450
or some meds for
end-stage liver failure.

141
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,120
Let's say no.

142
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,660
You don't want to
leave this job.

143
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,070
Three years you've been here.

144
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,470
You've never once laughed
at anything he said.

145
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,560
Because I wasn't
kissing his ass.

146
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,040
But now, you are?
No. Now, you're nervous.

147
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,870
Uncomfortable about
your decision.
Wasn't even that good a joke.

148
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,350
Oh, crap.

149
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,810
Most of your jokes
are excellent. I just meant
in comparison.

150
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,080
Shut up.
I think she may not
have an infection.

151
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,490
Better deal with her
before she crashes.

152
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,090
She can't breathe.
Get off the bed.

153
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,560
Need a crash cart.

154
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,730
What's happening?

155
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
Let's get her down. Now.

156
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,070
Pressure's collapsing
her lungs.
She's not getting any air.

157
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,910
Oh, my God.

158
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,130
CHASE: She couldn't breathe
because she had
a pleural effusion.

159
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,830
Thoracentesis revealed
low protein count,
effusion was transudative,

160
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,700
which means she has
cirrhosis of the liver,
or she's in heart failure.

161
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,140
Heart was fine,
liver enzymes were normal.

162
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,500
There's something
called "blude"
in the pleural effusion.

163
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh. It's not "blude,"
it's blood.

164
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,210
Which is great. Not for her,
but for me. Because it means
I think it's an infection.

165
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,010
Labs indicated
minute traces of blood.

166
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,320
You can't ignore the blood
because it's a minority.
Can you, Foreman?

167
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,220
If we count the traces
of blood as significant,

168
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,590
the differential
isn't just infection.

169
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,090
Could be lung cancer,
breast cancer, lymphoma...

170
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,390
Great. Go tell her
she's got one of those.

171
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,200
Or you can tell her that we
haven't given her enough
antibiotics for her infection.

172
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,430
Double the dose.
Then check her lungs.

173
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,500
We checked her lungs.
They're clean.

174
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,030
On the outside.
She needs an arteriogram.

175
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,950
It's about my bowel movements.

176
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,580
What isn't, these days?

177
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
You sure you want to
be here for this?

178
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,730
We do everything together.

179
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,290
Of course.
A toilet can be
a lonely place.

180
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,160
Drop your pants. I'll suit up.

181
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,800
They float.
Huh?

182
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,310
My bowel movements.
Honey says they're
not supposed to?

183
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,810
I'm a nutritionist.

184
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,510
Yes, I could tell from
the cool toe-loop sandals.

185
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,380
Thank you.
You're welcome.

186
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,420
And the natural fiber
clothing, I assume,

187
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,480
means some kind of
vegetarian denomination?

188
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,720
We're vegans. At first,
I was a little concerned
about the lack of protein

189
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,090
but Honey showed me
you can get it from lots...

190
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,360
Well, whatever floats
your poop.

191
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,430
And you've been together
how long? Six months?

192
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,230
How did you know?

193
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,900
Because after six months,
poop love fades

194
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,410
and if you'd been together
shorter than that, then...

195
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,670
I'll explain
right after this break.

196
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,220
Three 10-milligram pills
of your finest amphetamines.

197
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,220
Arteriogram was normal.

198
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,290
CHASE: Which means
her lungs are fine.

199
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,520
What if the clear
arteriogram is significant?

200
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,260
It is significant.
It means there's no infection.

201
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,670
I think there's an infection.

202
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,040
CAMERON: Infections don't
come and go.

203
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,940
People don't get
better then worse
on the same treatment.

204
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,740
Unless her body can't
finish off the fight.

205
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,740
Maybe goes a couple of rounds,
then gives up.

206
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,870
Why would it give up?

207
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,880
Maybe its name is Foreman.

208
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,310
Come on. Where's that smile?

209
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,280
That laugh that makes
the whole world sunny

210
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,910
without contributing
to global warming?

211
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,720
Maybe she's missing a protein.

212
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,950
Blood panel and enzymes
show her proteins are normal.

213
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,430
You can't have tested
for every protein.

214
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,060
I can think of at least one
you can't test for at all.

215
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,690
Complement factor-H
deficiency.
If she has that, she's dead.

216
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,100
No way to fend off bacteria.

217
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,110
She'll get one infection
after another until
her body shuts down.

218
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,940
Maybe we can get ahead
of the game. Manage each
symptom as it comes up.

219
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,740
Give her five miserable years
instead of six
miserable months.

220
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,150
There's no diagnostic test
for complement
factor-H deficiency.

221
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,550
So we isolate the cells
that are yummiest for it.

222
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,750
Stick a needle in her eye.

223
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,690
You're cheating on Honey.

224
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,890
What? No. I'm not.

225
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,130
Oh, yes, you are.

226
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,570
It's okay. I get it.

227
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,380
Well, I was
going to say relax.

228
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,570
But, oddly enough, you seem
pretty relaxed already.

229
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,640
You're accomplished.
You're funny.

230
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,340
You can have
whatever you want.
Women are gonna...

231
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,650
He's not cheating
with another woman.

232
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,090
He's cheating with
another food group.

233
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,280
What?

234
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,090
His floaters float
because they're full of fat.

235
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,030
Probably had a big
cheeseburger for lunch.

236
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,260
You're eating flesh?

237
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,460
It's just a hamburger.
Not all the time...

238
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,160
You're disgusting.

239
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,190
Soy cakes taste like
cardboard.
Unsalted cardboard.

240
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,370
I'm accomplished. I'm funny.

241
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,680
Can I have whatever I want?

242
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,380
Can we wait a second?

243
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,150
What's wrong?
I feel good.

244
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,690
Do you really need to
put that needle in?

245
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
You felt good yesterday,
and then you almost
suffocated.

246
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,920
And you know that,
that thing is in my eye?

247
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,520
We think it could be.

248
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,230
If we find it,
the hope is that
we can treat it.

249
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,930
You hope?
Mom.
Don't hang on every word.

250
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,000
He said he hopes.
That means he doesn't know.

251
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,210
I just want to understand
what's going on.

252
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,800
We won't know anything
until we do the test.

253
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,310
Addie, this all looks
really scary, but you'll
feel nothing. Okay?

254
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,550
Okay.

255
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,860
You rang?
You called me.

256
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,130
I bought you an espresso.

257
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,900
You've been buying me coffee
for a couple of weeks.

258
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,270
I thought I'd
pay you back with one.

259
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,110
How did you walk
with the cane
and the two coffees?

260
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,710
Why are you suspicious?

261
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,480
Because it's either that,
or accept the fact that you've
done something nice.

262
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,190
And then I have to deal with
the horsemen and the rain
of fire and the end of days.

263
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,820
You think I spat in yours?

264
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,360
Or worse.

265
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,860
I stacked them.

266
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,450
What do you think of me
hiring a nutritionist
instead of a neurologist?

267
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,120
I mean, they sound
almost the same.

268
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,220
I take it you've met
a hot nutritionist.

269
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,660
Don't cheapen this.

270
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,500
We had an in-depth
conversation
about proteins and fats.

271
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,140
I was about to
examine her boyfriend's
rectum.

272
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,830
You asked for a date
while your finger was
in her boyfriend?

273
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,100
I got her number.

274
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,200
No. No. No way.

275
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,340
This is an employment
application.

276
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,410
She doesn't want to
go out with you.
She's looking for a job.

277
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,550
Oh, God. She's 26.

278
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,780
But with the wisdom
of a much younger woman.

279
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,390
Have you spoken to Foreman?

280
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,400
Several times. We laughed...

281
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,660
You're going to lose him.

282
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,200
And that will be depressing.

283
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,640
But it will only make me
appreciate all the good things
that I do have.

284
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,010
Macular biopsy was negative.
Which means you're wrong.

285
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,140
There's no complement
factor-H deficiency.

286
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,840
Most likely cause of altering
blood flow in the brain
is a clot or a tumor.

287
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,320
We can rule out a clotting
issue because she has
a bleeding issue.

288
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,080
Which means we should be
looking for a tumor.

289
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,350
I think there's an infection.

290
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,590
Just 'cause the cells in
her eye aren't dead yet
doesn't mean they're working.

291
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,890
So, why did we do the test?

292
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,800
Because if it had been
positive, it would have
proved I was right.

293
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,460
But negative doesn't
prove you wrong?

294
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,300
That's the beauty of the test.

295
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,470
She needs an MRI of her brain.

296
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,630
Absolutely.

297
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,380
As long as you're scanning,
you mind having a boo
for an abscess

298
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,710
for something
caused by an infection?

299
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,680
I didn't expect House
to beg me to stay.

300
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,130
But it seems like he's
in a better mood since I quit.

301
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,090
Nothing in the axial view.

302
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,800
You haven't asked me
why I'm leaving.

303
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,000
I figured you'd tell me
when you wanted to.

304
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,840
I don't want to be like him.

305
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,470
You're not a jerk.

306
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,670
Thank you.

307
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,750
I mean, sometimes you are.

308
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,520
But I don't think we can
pin that on House.

309
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,820
And you're a better doctor
than when you
came through the door.

310
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,080
I'm better at some things.
Worse at others.

311
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,060
Again, not House's fault.
It's a job.

312
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,730
We're supposed to
take the good
and leave the bad.

313
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,630
It's easier for you.

314
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,630
Why? Because you think
I need to toughen up?

315
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,400
You think I'm weak?

316
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,670
Yeah.

317
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,600
See? I am a jerk.
I've got to get out of here.

318
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,810
(ADDIE GROANING)

319
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
What's wrong, Addie?

320
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,410
My head hurts!

321
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,680
Her brain's clean.
No tumor and no abscess.

322
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,620
We're all wrong.
My head!

323
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,590
(SCREAMING)

324
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,160
My head!

325
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,660
My head!

326
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,140
Grody.

327
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,110
Looks like massive
tissue death.

328
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,710
Who cares? Her head blew up.

329
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,510
How cool is that?
CAMERON: It's not pussy.

330
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,920
Meaning you don't think
it's an infection and you'd be
right, if you weren't wrong.

331
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,080
Here we go again.

332
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,720
She's got infections
that come and go.

333
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,020
Which means...
It means it has to be
something else.

334
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,030
Good guess. But no.

335
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,030
It either she's got
a leprechaun in her colon,

336
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,930
which is playing
with the doggie door,

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,270
letting bacteria in and out,
or she's got complement
factor-H deficiency.

338
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,430
You enjoying this?

339
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm saving a woman's life.

340
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm saving a woman's life!
Actually, I'm diagnosing her.

341
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,850
Technically, I'm diagnosing
her with something that's
going to kill her.

342
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,540
But, other than that,
I'm saving her life.

343
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,810
An autoimmune problem
makes more sense.

344
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,750
You can't explain
a transudative
pleural effusion

345
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,310
with giant cell arteritis.

346
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,190
You'd need three whiteboards
and 100 different
colored markers.

347
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,790
No, it's much more likely
she has an invisible protein

348
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,390
that allowed bacteria
to arbitrarily
invade her lungs

349
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,160
then arbitrarily invade
her pleura, then arbitrarily
jump into her head.

350
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,100
If it's autoimmune,
she can live.

351
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,270
But we have to give her
steroids, now.
Before her heart ruptures.

352
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,510
If you're wrong,
and you give her
steroids she dies, now.

353
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,950
Foreman. Want to run down
how it feels to go with your
gut and kill a person?

354
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,250
You can get into
the whole spiraling
out of control,

355
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,380
and the self-doubt,
and the resigning thing.

356
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,760
Do it.

357
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,130
Worst that can happen
is you quit.

358
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,700
Cameron, want to explain
to the parents

359
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,240
why you'll be holding paddles
while he's doing it?

360
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,600
Because if her heart goes
"boom", it will
"boom" right away.

361
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,110
She really has to be
awake for this?

362
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,580
If there's a problem,
she could tell us
what she feels.

363
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,660
Relax.

364
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,920
We're scared.

365
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,890
I don't want you to be scared.

366
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,990
Then, get better.
Okay, sweetie?

367
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,490
We love you.

368
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,670
Ready?

370
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,880
Ready.

371
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,110
My patient's about to have
a heart attack.
It's going to be massive.

372
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,200
Oh, wow. That's too bad.

373
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,150
Because I just got
tickets to a stroke
on the third floor.

374
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,740
Have you had
a conversation with Foreman?

375
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,940
Do me a favor?

376
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,220
You haven't.

377
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,720
Because then you would have to
confront your own emotions.

378
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,350
Is bile an emotion?
Because I definitely feel
something here.

379
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,930
Get me some liquorice.
This is going to be the
best heart attack of all time.

380
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,260
Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to shock her.

381
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,220
There's always tomorrow.

382
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,100
You wanted to see me?

383
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,110
Pretty sure the label
is straight.

384
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,940
Are you really going to leave?
Where are you going?

385
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,610
You lined up interviews yet?
I'm not sure.

386
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,640
You're pissed at House.
I get it. You're
symbolicating killing him.

387
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,550
Symbolicating. What?
Symbolicalating.

388
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,520
Gosh, that's a hard word.
Are you okay?

389
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,220
Hey, I'm not the one...
I'm not the one...

390
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,230
I'm not the one
pretending to kill someone.

391
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,100
What would it take for you
to stay? Is it money?
He wants you to stay.

392
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,630
He said that?
If I said he said that,

393
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,400
(PHONE RINGING)
Would that make a difference?

394
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,870
Are you sure you're okay?
Hello?

395
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,530
I'm leaving now.

396
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,840
I'm late for a breast thing.
You know he wants you.

397
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,070
You know he's good.
You know he can make you good.

398
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,910
I don't know what I'm saying.
You know... I don't...
You know what I'm saying.

399
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,350
And you know I'm right.
I've got to go.

400
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,010
Sorry it took me so long to
get down here. I'm Dr. Wilson.

401
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,520
I guess Dr. Stein is gone.
Don't worry about it.

402
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,460
I'll talk to him
when we're done.

403
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,860
Dr. Stein said
they're probably
calcium deposits.

404
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,330
But with your medical history,
you don't want to
take chances.

405
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,540
I can't seem to
put my gloves on today.
That's weird.

406
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,530
Okay. Well, that's fine.
One's enough.
Well, let's have a look.

407
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,600
You sure talk fast.

408
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,810
This is nothing.
You should see me
when we're busy.

409
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,040
I just winked at you.
I just... I've never winked
at a patient in my life.

410
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,490
I have no... I am so sorry.
I have no idea
what I was thinking.

411
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,520
It's okay.
No, it's not.
I was hitting on you.

412
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,080
I mean, I wasn't...
I wasn't consciously
hitting on you, but I...

413
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,220
What else could you think?
That you were
being reassuring?

414
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,320
Yeah. That would make sense.
On the other hand, I...

415
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,430
I feel like my heart's
going to explode.

416
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,830
Are you okay?

417
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,430
I feel a little sweaty.
Am I sweating?

418
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,560
Yeah.

419
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,230
Is something wrong?
I can't...

420
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,170
I put on gloves to do
a breast exam. Perfect. Sorry.

421
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,120
It's 185.

422
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,950
One eighty-five.

423
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,380
One eighty-five?

424
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,620
Excuse me.
I have to go kill someone.

425
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,160
<i>(BANGING ON DOOR)</i>

426
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,030
You dosed me!

427
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,470
Yes, I did. But only because
you didn't trust me.

428
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,560
Your best friend!

429
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,870
You could have killed me!

430
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,500
Amphetamines aren't
going to kill you.

431
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,130
You don't know
my medical history!

432
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,370
I could have...
I could have...

433
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,340
You could have given me
a heart attack!

434
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,940
A heart attack is not
going to kill you.
You were in a hospital.

435
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,570
You yawned!

436
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
You tried to kill me!

437
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,520
I put you on uppers
and you still yawned.

438
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,720
Means it's a symptom
of being a big, fat liar.

439
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,420
Yawning is a side effect
of some anti-depressants.

440
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,900
Apparently,
the ones you're on.

441
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,900
I'm not on anti-depressants,
I'm on speed.

442
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,130
That means it's a symptom
of a cerebral tumor.

443
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,930
You got six weeks to live.

444
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,870
Mr. Well-adjusted
is as messed up
as the rest of us.

445
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,340
Why... Why would you
keep that a secret?

446
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,140
Are you ashamed of recognizing
how pathetic your life is?

447
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,910
It's not a secret.
House, it's... It's...

448
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,610
It's personal.

449
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,740
How long has it been personal?
It's personal.

450
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,350
Yawning is recent.
So, either you just started,

451
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,320
or you changed prescriptions.
This is why I take them.

452
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,290
They're anti-depressants,
not anti-annoyance-ants.

453
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,360
You'd think this would
naturally come up
in conversation.

454
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,590
Oh, don't act hurt.
You don't care.

455
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,960
On one of the occasions
when you were pompously
lecturing me

456
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,130
on what to do to fix my life.

457
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,470
You wouldn't take them.
You'd rather OD on Vicodin

458
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,840
or stick electrodes in your
head, because you could say
you did it to get high.

459
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,170
The only reason to
take anti-depressants
is because you're depressed.

460
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,540
You... You have to admit
that you're depressed.

461
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,880
Give me.

462
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,910
Are you going to admit that...

463
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,780
No, I'm gonna prove
that I'm not depressed.

464
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,860
Well, I can't give you
my prescription. You've got to
meet with a psychiatrist.

465
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,260
You... You need
a whole work-up.

466
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
Give me a Vicodin
so I don't stroke.

467
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,900
I wouldn't drink that.

468
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,680
My leg hurt, and I...

469
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,480
(PHONE RINGING)

470
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,470
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

471
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,300
(DOOR CREAKING)

472
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,190
House, why didn't you
pick up the phone?

473
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,050
We've been calling.
I was sleeping.

474
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
What did you do?

475
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,370
Nothing.

476
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,970
This is how regular
people look when
you wake them up.

477
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,750
Chase was wrong.
Addie's kidneys shut down.

478
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,030
Hemolytic uremic syndrome
shut down Addie's kidneys.

479
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,070
Peripheral smear of red cells
had schistocytes.

480
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,170
HUS is usually caused
by an infection
or protein deficiency.

481
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,870
What a coincidence.

482
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,210
I know a patient
with an infection
and a protein deficiency.

483
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,610
Do you think it's possible
there's a connection?

484
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,980
I want to hear you say it,
Chase. It will please me.

485
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,280
Doesn't mean you're right.
You predicted cardiac arrest,

486
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,020
instant cardiac arrest.

487
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,820
There were only two choices.

488
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,090
Since yours was wrong,
mine must have been right.

489
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,650
Either that,
or we missed the leprechaun.

490
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,200
If you're right,
there's nothing to be done.

491
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,030
The steroid treatment
we gave her means

492
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,000
when the next infection hits,
it will hit hard.
Liver failure, cardiac arrest.

493
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,230
On the bright side
it confirms my diagnosis.

494
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,510
Don't you see how incredible
this call was?
A protein deficiency.

495
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,340
It can't be tested.
Can't be seen.

496
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,510
I called it based
on coughing blood.

497
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,640
You're happy about this.

498
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,020
She's going to die.

499
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,520
That's not my fault.

500
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,490
She was going to die, anyway.

501
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,820
And now, thanks to me,
at least she'll know why.

502
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,290
I'm sure you'll see
that gratitude in her eyes
when you tell her.

503
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,390
I'm not telling her.

504
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,520
I'm not telling her.

505
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,230
No one's telling her.
Not until we're sure
I'm right.

506
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,030
But we're waiting for her to
stroke or have a heart attack
to confirm before we tell her?

507
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,340
Seems like
the humane approach.

508
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,680
Her heart went into V-fib.
Brought her back, barely.

509
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,720
Congratulations,
you have your confirmation.

510
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,300
What's her name?

511
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,100
Who? The co-ed?
Sure.

512
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,010
Dead sophomore girl?

513
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,180
You know her father's name?

514
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,720
Dad. Her mother's name
is Mommy.

515
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,690
Ben and Jody are about to lose
their only daughter, Addie.

516
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,450
You think that they're
gonna give a crap
if I know their names?

517
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,080
Five years from now,
when the father's looking
at photographs

518
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,250
of his daughter
graduating from high school,

519
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,160
they're not going to remember
the nice black doctor

520
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,430
who called them
by their first name.

521
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,230
You don't wanna quit.

522
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,440
You saying you
don't want me to quit?

523
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,270
Didn't sound like I said that.

524
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,410
I'm saying that suddenly
you're trying to turn me into
a kinder, gentler ass.

525
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,820
Because you know who you are.

526
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,380
And you figure if you can
make me decent and caring,
then maybe there's hope for...

527
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,820
You're about to tell a girl
she's dying and you think
it's about you.

528
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,350
God, I hope I'm not you.

529
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,550
I'm sorry.

530
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,750
Addie, you're dying.

531
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,550
Are you sure?

532
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,320
Yes.

533
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,760
Your infections will
get worse. The toxins will
spill into your blood.

534
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,290
How long?

535
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,700
Two days, maybe less.

536
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,100
You have a condition called...

537
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,110
Does it matter?

538
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,810
It's a very rare
protein deficiency
that only manifests...

539
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,580
I don't want to hear it.

540
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,180
Okay.

541
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,540
It's what's killing you.
This is what's killing you.

542
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,640
You're not interested
in what's killing you?

543
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,080
Will it make any difference?
Will I live any longer?

544
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,950
Please, could you just leave?

545
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,480
What's the point in living
without curiosity?
Without craving the...

546
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,860
So, I'm screwing up
my last few hours because
I won't listen to you?

547
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,420
Get out of here.

548
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,230
It's... It's like the
dark matter in the universe.

549
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,330
You're smiling.

550
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,630
No, I'm not.

551
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,170
You can only diagnose
a problem by looking
at what's...

552
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,110
Missing.

553
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,550
Oh, God.

554
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,950
I have to go.

555
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,350
Nineteen-year-old
didn't want to hear
the coolest explanation

556
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,630
of why she's going to die,
begged me to shut up.

557
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,930
If you can't shut up,
at least talk quietly.

558
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,300
Amphetamine withdrawal's
a bitch. She thought
that I was happy.

559
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,810
You were happy?
No, I was hazy.

560
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,040
And I don't get hazy
on Vicodin, or anything else
I throw down.

561
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,550
Which means
I was throwing down something

562
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,210
I didn't know I was
throwing down.
Which got me to wondering...

563
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,280
Why didn't you give me
those happy pills?

564
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,950
I told you.
You've got to be
checked out by...

565
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,520
No, you just didn't
want me double-dosing.

566
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,260
You dosed me!

567
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,730
Those coffees...
They worked!

568
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,530
You've been smiling,
relaxed, happy.

569
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,870
A dying girl thought
I was happy.

570
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,240
A moron thought I was happy.

571
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,900
Who the hell doesn't
want to know why she's dying?

572
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,100
House was happy.
Hazy.

573
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,200
Happy.
Hazy!

574
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,550
Oh, right.
A dying girl mistook
hazy for happy.

575
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,680
Because dying people
see happiness everywhere.

576
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,580
She's miserable.
She wasn't miserable.

577
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,450
Of course she was miserable.
You just told her...

578
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,990
She was no different
than she'd ever been.

579
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,220
She was no different
than she'd ever been.

580
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,500
Oh, God.

581
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,900
I gotta go.

582
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,380
Need a minute
with your daughter.

583
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,110
Dr. House,
get out of here before...

584
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,950
She's gonna live.

585
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,220
Does that help? Now, get out.

586
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,350
Are you jerking us around...

587
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,010
Get out.

588
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,430
You have got
leprechauns in you.

589
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,730
Depression manifests
in lots of different ways.

590
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,940
Some people can't
get out of bed all day,

591
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,810
others have
serial relationships
and become oncologists.

592
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,380
I'm dying, I'm not depressed.

593
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,320
Wrong. And wrong.

594
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,620
You tried to kill yourself
by throwing down
kitchen cleanser.

595
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,520
Now, most normal
suicidal morons would have
just drank the stuff.

596
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,920
Burned the hell out
of their mouth and throat.

597
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,990
<i>Painful, but not deadly.</i>

598
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,130
<i>But being a college-educated</i>
<i>suicidal moron,</i>

599
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,230
<i>you wrapped it in</i>
<i>gel caps or gum.</i>

600
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,940
Which left no trace,
but it burned a hole
in your intestine.

601
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,210
But the body can repair
almost anything,
which is cool.

602
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,380
In your case, scar tissue
closed up the hole.

603
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,050
<i>But it also formed a bridge</i>
<i>between a vein and an artery.</i>

604
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,160
Now, veins are supposed
to help the intestine
flush bacteria away.

605
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,860
<i>But the bridge allowed</i>
<i>the bacteria entrance</i>
<i>to the artery.</i>

606
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,200
Where they got
a free ride everywhere.

607
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,970
Can you fix me?

608
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,610
Surgery to fix the bridge'll
take about two hours.

609
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,620
The psychotherapy's
going to take a little longer.

610
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,780
Why'd you do it?

611
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,750
I don't know.

612
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,930
I've just

613
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,930
never been happy.

614
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,200
Please don't tell my parents.

615
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,440
They'll blame themselves
and it's not their fault.

616
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,410
Please, you can't tell them.

617
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:18,090
Technically, all you have
to do is promise me that
you won't do it again.

618
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,960
Then, legally,
I can't tell them.

619
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,800
I promise.

620
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,810
Yeah, sure.

621
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,670
We can't thank you...

622
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,210
Your daughter tried to
kill herself.

623
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,450
That's why she's here.

624
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,180
Legally, I'm supposed to
keep that between me and her.

625
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,620
Which makes sense,
she's obviously an adult,

626
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,560
capable of her own
well-reasoned decisions.

627
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,900
You're sure?

628
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,630
If she doesn't die
in the next couple of hours,

629
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,720
yeah, I'm right.

630
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,130
How could she hide this?

631
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,270
Everyone has secrets.

632
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,210
We'll take care of her.
Figure it out.

633
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,250
Make her happy?

634
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,980
We'll get her into therapy.

635
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,750
Might want to try
some meds, too.

636
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,190
Can we call you?

637
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,300
If we have any questions?

638
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,500
No.

639
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,310
What's up?
Nothing.

640
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,150
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

641
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,420
House's patient?
Yeah.

642
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,120
The one that would have died,
if not for him.

643
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,220
Subtle.
Thanks.

644
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,670
You're really scared
you'll turn into him.

645
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,230
Don't tell me
I'm better than him.

646
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,030
Don't tell me, take the good
and leave the bad.

647
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,700
Cameron already tried.

648
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,310
I'm telling you
there are worse things
to turn into.

649
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,980
It's not worth it.

650
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,850
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

651
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,540
I didn't think you were
going to show.

652
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,010
Sorry, surgery went
a little late.

653
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,280
So, you really think
I have all the necessary
qualifications?

654
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,710
I can't discuss this
with a dry mouth.
What do you got there?

655
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,450
Peppermint tea.

656
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,560
I'm going to have
a mug of peppermint tea,
please.

657
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,300
This isn't a job interview,
is it?

658
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,700
It's some kind of interview.

659
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,370
You're judging me.
I'm judging you.

660
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,970
You have the upper hand.

661
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,980
I don't know anything
about you.

662
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,040
I'm on antidepressants

663
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,250
because a doctor friend
of mine thinks I'm miserable.

664
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,050
I don't like them,
they make me hazy.
I eat meat, I like drugs.

665
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,090
And I'm not always faithful
to the women I date.

666
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:20,000
You don't seem depressed.

667
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,000
You do realize you just
skipped over several
deep character flaws

668
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,730
that most women would
run screaming from.

669
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,400
You told the truth.

670
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,600
Yeah, I don't always do that,
either.

671
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,810
Well, how miserable
can you be,

672
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,580
saving lives, sleeping around,
and doing drugs?

673
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,680
Were you on the debating team
in high school?

674
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,790
Also, I hate

675
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,520
tea.
