Twenty-five years ago,
Patrick was in
the fourth grade,

played Little League

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,560

was the accident.

I'm going back to bed.
Dystonia's not
life threatening.

36
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,940
Clonazepam will
take care of it.

He's already on clonazepam

There is no case, House.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,950
Even if dystonia was some
big medical mystery,
it's not this time.

48
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,790
You're not intrigued
as to how a perfectly
healthy 10-year-old boy

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,030
with no prior
musical training
gets into an accident

play the piano?

That's a yes.

Savantism is just
one of those things.

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,550
It's inexplicable.

57
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,740
Just because it's inexplicted
doesn't mean
it's inexplicable.

58

He repeats what people say.
It's a compensation mechanism.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,380
He knows he's supposed
to say something

69
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,310
so he repeats
what he's just heard.

out of the car

with more important things,

180
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,240
You've been here?

181
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,010
Where else would
the bedroom be?

182
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,980
Come with?

183
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,990
You're scared of
him catching us
breaking into his home

184
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,360
but you're not
scared of him catching us
doing it in his bed?

185
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,390
If I'm gonna get
fired anyway...

186
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:17,610
Almost at the heart.
Ablating and done.

187
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,200
Heart rate's 160.
It's accelerating.

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,570
He's at 210!

189
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,130
He's in
supraventricular tachycardia.

190
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,680
Paddles!

191
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,080
Charging.

192
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,280
Clear!

193
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,320
We're wasting our time.

194
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,720
His high-school yearbook.

195
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,050
Unless you think
he's going to Boston

196
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
to attend
a high-school reunion,

197
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,220
put it back and
let's get out of here
before he comes home.

198
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,690
He's not smiling.

199
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,590
CHASE:
I wonder if he has teeth.

200
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,000
What's the area
code for Boston?

201
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,660
617, why?

202
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,080
<i>WOMAN ON PHONE.:</i>
<i>Massachusetts General.</i>
<i>May I help you?</i>

203
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,870
Did you think you could steal
Dr. House without a fight?

204
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,040
<i>MEDAK ON PHONE.:</i>
<i>Steal him for what?</i>

205
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,950
Quit jerking me around.
I know he's coming out there.

206
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,420
<i>We're not</i>
<i>looking to hire him.</i>

207
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,210
He's called you six times
in the last month.

208
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,620
<i>We're not</i>
<i>looking to hire him.</i>

209
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,810
You think if you
keep repeating it,
I'll start believing you?

210
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,650
<i>Dr. Cuddy, there's</i>
<i>nothing else I can say.</i>

211
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,420
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

212
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,320
If he's not coming there
for a job interview,

213
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,960
he's either coming
to your hospital

214
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,590
for a social visit or
because he's a patient.

215
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,060
Is it a social visit,
Dr. Medak?

216
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,100
<i>I can't stand House.</i>

217
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,070
<i>Neither can Dr. Coopersmith.</i>

218
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,190
What's up?

219
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,720
Do you know a
Dr. Coopersmith in Boston?

220
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,090
Yeah. He's an oncologist.

221
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,190
What's up?

222
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,730
What's his subspecialty?

223
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,390
Brain cancer.

224
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,300
What's going on?

225
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,800
CUDDY: He doesn't look sick.

226
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,350
He should have symptoms.

227
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,110
Blurred vision, headaches,
confusion, clumsiness.

228
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,080
Depends how far
along the cancer is.

229
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,920
What kind, how aggressive.

230
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,750
He didn't tell you?

231
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,950
House is House.

232
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,360
He's no different
than anyone else with cancer.

233
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,130
Once you tell,
then every conversation
is about that.

234
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,760
FOREMAN: Cardiac arrest
means we were wrong.

235
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,330
There was a heart problem.

236
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,840
But no vasoconstriction.

237
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,810
The heart problem
couldn't have
caused the hand problem.

238
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,370
Unless the bleed
happened suddenly.

239
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,800
Less blood to the brain
explains the dystonia.

240
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,780
Less blood to the heart
explains the heart attack.

241
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,370
Scope him above and below.

242
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,350
If that doesn't work,
gut him.

243
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,880
Can't you sedate him?

244
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,050
There's a risk his
throat could collapse.

245
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,590
You look mad, Papa.

246
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,190
No.

247
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,490
No, I'm not mad.
I promise you.

248
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,060
It's just that the doctor
has to do something
to you and it's...

249
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,500
And it's gonna hurt.

250
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,090
Hurt me? Why hurt me?

251
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,760
Make you better.

252
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,670
What's wrong with me?

253
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,940
Well, they don't know.

254
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,070
Patrick, don't you worry.

255
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,710
Everything is gonna be great.

256
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,110
All right.
Here we go, Patrick.

257
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,410
You wanna hurt me.

258
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,580
Hey, open. Like this.

259
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,820
You just look at me
and everything
is gonna be okay.

260
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,050
Look at me now.

261
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,920
Patrick.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,400
There you are.
It's okay. It's okay, really.

263
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,910
Dr. Wilson. Wilson!

264
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,930
I just spoke to Cuddy.

265
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,370
She can't confirm
whether House

266
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,740
is applying for
a job in Boston.

267
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,540
Yeah. I'm late for a...

268
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,980
If I have to look for work,
I have a right to know.

269
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,750
(PLAYING PIANO)

270
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,590
Pretty.

271
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,390
I wrote this when I was
in junior high school.

272
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,830
Could never figure
out what came next.

273
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,940
Then dimwit
came up with this.

274
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,840
(PLAYING PIANO)

275
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
It's good.

276
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,650
It's perfect.

277
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,560
I could set up
a tower on the roof
during a lightning storm.

278
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,360
Help you switch
brains with your patient.

279
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,230
Then you would be
the brilliant pianist

280
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,760
and he would be the doctor
hiding brain cancer
from his friend.

281
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,940
It's nothing.

282
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,340
You need to talk about it.

283
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,540
You need to talk about it.

284
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,240
At least let me look
at your medical file.

285
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,640
You're making a big
deal out of nothing.

286
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,910
Who else knows?

287
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,610
No one,
and cancer isn't nothing.

288
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,850
Sorry. Didn't mean to
offend your specialty.

289
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,250
Why didn't you come to me?

290
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,520
Stein's good.

291
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,750
Stein's in Africa for
the next six months.

292
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,380
He's given me
at least six months.

293
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,220
I go to Boston.
I get the treatment.

294
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,850
Everything will be fine.

295
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,660
No need to talk about it.

296
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,460
CHASE: You were right.

297
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,230
Surgeon found
a bleed behind the kidney

298
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,790
in the retroperitoneal cavity,
but no reason for it.

299
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,360
No cancer,
no ruptured arteries.

300
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,600
So bleeding explains
the symptoms

301
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,310
but we've got no explanation
for the bleeding.

302
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,950
And while they
were closing him up,

303
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,240
Patrick had
a grand mal seizure,

304
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,750
which makes no sense,

305
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,310
since he's on
an anticonvulsant medication.

306
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,420
You told him.

307
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,860
No, I didn't.

308
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,120
I only told Cameron.

309
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,470
HOUSE: Hey!

310
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,500
Okay, you guys
have cleverly deduced
that I have cancer.

311
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,910
You have no right to know.

312
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,110
You have no business knowing.

313
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,580
We'd like to run
some blood tests.

314
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,080
As soon as you
work up our patient,
who is not me.

315
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,140
We just want to make sure
you weren't misdiagnosed.

316
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,880
I wasn't. Let's move on.

317
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,790
We're just asking
for a couple of vials.

318
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,380
No!
Why not?

319
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,690
Okay, we are going to proceed
as if I am perfectly healthy.

320
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,660
How can we do that
if we know you're not?

321
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,790
You don't know anything!

322
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,360
Except, hopefully,

323
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,100
how a patient on
anticonvulsant medication
has a seizure.

324
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,700
Anti-seizure meds
don't prevent seizures.

325
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,170
They just make
them manageable.

326
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,500
According to
the surgeon's report,

327
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,130
this one wasn't even
close to manageable.

328
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,540
Means the question isn't,
"Why is he having seizures?"

329
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,140
It's, "Why are his
seizures getting worse?"

330
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,550
What's changed?

331
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,680
His brain. It's gotten worse.

332
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,950
So we make it even worser.

333
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,280
We take him off
anticonvulsant medication.

334
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,480
CAMERON:
He'll seize even more.

335
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,650
Multiple seizures can
seriously damage a brain.

336
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,290
Dude can't button a shirt.

337
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,090
How much more damage
are we really talking about?

338
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,290
Stronger seizures
will light up
different parts of the brain,

339
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,160
which will indicate
which parts are damaged.

340
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,730
Once he gets worse,
do a PET scan.

341
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,100
(DOOR SHUTS)

342
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,900
PET scan done?

343
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,500
No.

344
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,680
Did you come for my feelings?

345
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,780
'Cause I left them
in my other pants.

346
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,510
This is a letter
of recommendation.

347
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,580
I'm applying
for a job at Penn.

348
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,120
Thank you for
writing your own.

349
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,190
I'm sure my thoughts
are beautifully phrased.

350
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,330
Thank you for signing it,
saves me having to
fake your signature.

351
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,770
Stay away from Weiss.

352
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,780
He cries with his patients,
holds their hands as they die.

353
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,510
He won't like you.

354
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,620
Your newfound nonchalance
in the face of cancer.

355
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,160
I thought you'd
find it appealing.

356
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,720
20 seconds. Pretty good.

357
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,100
For what?

358
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,690
The time it took you to go
from hard-ass to human being.

359
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,210
You really want to leave?

360
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,110
If you're not here,
there's not much
point in staying.

361
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,110
I'm not dead yet.

362
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,120
What are you doing?

363
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,660
I know this must be
a turn-on for you.

364
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,360
A little whorish
to kiss and stab.

365
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,930
You kissed back.

366
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,560
I didn't want you to die
without knowing the feeling.

367
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,110
Actually, no woman should die
without knowing the feeling.

368
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,340
All we need is a few
drops of your blood.

369
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,570
Foreman and Chase's lips
are not gonna get so close,

370
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,140
now that I know your plan.

371
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,240
There's a nurse downstairs
about to risk his job

372
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,880
to steal the blood
you drew from
yourself yesterday.

373
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,420
I'm patient number 020406,

374
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,320
in the record room,
under the name Luke N. Laura.

375
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,920
There's a whole vial of blood
in there along with CT scans,

376
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,690
MRls, CSF.
Everything you need.

377
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,930
If you need a sperm sample,
come back without the needle.

378
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,750
Six centimeter mass
in his dorsal midbrain,

379
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,220
extending into
the temporal lobe.

380
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,750
That's inoperable.

381
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,820
What kind of
time does he have?

382
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,990
He's got a year.

Nurse! Nurse!

385
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,100
Here's the consent from Boston
for the cancer drug trial.

386
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,510
Any description
of the process
or previous trials?

387
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,480
Yep.
Any chance it'll work?

388
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,410
No. It's not even
designed to work.

389
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,910
Why would he...

390
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,040
It's designed to
treat depression
in terminal cancer patients.

391
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,310
He doesn't seem depressed.

(DOOR BANGING)

393
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,450
Okay,
let's assume that I am dying,

394
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,360
which I specifically
told you not to assume.

395
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,490
Can we at least assume
that I'm not dying tomorrow?

396
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,660
Whereas this kid...

397
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,260
PET revealed
several more hot spots
but they're non-specific.

398
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,240
How can you focus on him?

399
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,270
It's the only way I can cope.

400
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,210
PET also showed a left brain
that's working hard.

401
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
Harder than the right?

402
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,070
Wouldn't be worth
mentioning otherwise.

403
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,410
Bleeding in the brain,
blood would
irritate the lining,

404
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,510
might cause
the seizures to get worse.

405
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,040
Yes, he needs an angiogram
to look at the vasculature
inside his brain.

406
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,560
We'll get right on it
as soon as
we're finished here.

407
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,320
Don't get up. I got it.
You're busy. Continue.

408
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,990
You know what my team
is doing right now?

409
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,600
No.

410
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,910
They're trying to figure out
what's wrong with me.

411
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,030
What's wrong with you?

412
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,480
Thanks for asking.

413
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,080
They've found out
that I'm dying.

414
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,740
That's sad.

415
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,350
Everyone's dying.

416
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,680
That's sad.

417
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,350
If a meteor lands
on my head tomorrow,
it's all academic.

418
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,390
I told them to leave me alone.
But did they?

419
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,690
Did they?

420
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,350
That one was rhetorical.

421
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,690
Oh.

422
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,990
No, they did not.

423
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,370
Who the hell were you
before you hit your head?

424
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,100
Hell is a bad word.

425
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,670
So is "ass" and "bitch."

426
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,870
I could probably
rattle off 50 much more

427
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,780
complicated and
disgusting ones,

428
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,250
but then your dad
would get pissed at me.

429
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,780
You like your life?

430
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,720
What life?

431
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,020
Your life.

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,790
Playing the piano,
going on tour,
scoring girls left and right.

433
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,620
I don't like girls.

434
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,890
Boys. Whatever gets you off.

435
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,630
I like the piano.

436
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,010
What's wrong?

437
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,410
Dr. Peter Hayes.
This is Eric Foreman,
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

438
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,240
You're doing
a signal transduction
inhibitor clinical trial.

439
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,040
What kind of
results have you been...

440
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,050
Transduction inhibitors
are a decade away.

441
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,090
Bye, Pete.

442
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,090
They've got another
trial going at Duke.

443
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,290
15 percent extend their lives
beyond five years.

444
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,630
If you're positive
for protein PHF...

445
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,330
Stop trying to save me.

446
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,390
I'm fine.

447
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,170
MRA confirmed small
collections of blood

448
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,610
throughout the white matter
of Patrick's
right hemisphere.

449
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,270
Mind if we chat about that
for a few moments?

450
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,080
Either trauma, an aneurysm,
cancer or autoimmune disease.

451
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,810
We need a biopsy to
figure out which it is.

452
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
His EEG was non-specific.

453
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,540
Where you going to biopsy?

454
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,550
Everywhere.

455
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,780
Sure, just put on a blindfold
and play "Pin
the Tail on the Brain."

456
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,590
He's bleeding into his brain.
He's dying.

457
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,250
You can't just randomly
stab the temporal lobe

458
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,730
and hope you hit
the right spot.

459
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,290
I'm only gonna take
little tiny pieces.

460
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,460
Till what?

461
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,630
Till I find the problem.

462
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,730
Or you kill him.

463
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,290
No, I'll keep going,
even if I kill him.

464
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,240
Then he's screwed.
Thanks for the chat.

465
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,420
What if we do the EEG
from inside his brain?

466
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm actually
a little insulted.

467
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,630
You were supposed to
spend the last hour
worrying about me.

468
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,960
It's risky and invasive.

469
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,020
But that's why God invented
the long consent form.

470
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,900
Can you get to why
this is a brilliant idea?

471
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,000
External EEG
could get confused

472
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,200
if there are multiple
structural abnormalities.

473
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,000
If we perform
the EEG inside the skull,

474
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,640
it could show us
where to biopsy.

475
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,840
Brilliant. Go. Do.

476
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,040
I'd also like to
talk to you about...

477
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,480
This is going to be personal,
isn't it?

478
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,820
Yeah.

479
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,700
FOREMAN: We'll use
a small drill to
get inside his skull.

480
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,000
OBYEDKOV:
There's bleeding inside?

481
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,140
Yes. Once we have 12 holes,

482
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,110
we'll surgically
implant the electrodes

483
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,480
under the meninges,
against the brain.

484
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,880
OBYEDKOV: And it's
either cancer or
autoimmune disease?

485
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,050
FOREMAN: Sorry, but yeah.

486
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,830
OBYEDKOV: Which one is better?

487
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,130
Neither.

488
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,290
Hey.

489
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,490
Where do we cut?

490
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,630
We don't.

491
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,760
I need to say something.

492
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,870
Something personal?

493
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah.

494
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,600
And I can't leave

495
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,870
because you've got
something interesting
in that file.

496
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,140
Sorry.

497
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,290
You're an arrogant ass who
makes it impossible
for anyone to like him

498
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,120
by punishing people
who don't deserve...

499
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,090
Can you get to the "but" part
of this speech?

500
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,190
But I like you.

501
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,490
No, you don't.

502
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,360
You're just reacting to
the perception of my death

503
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,600
and the need to
put things in order.
Fear of guilt...

504
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,860
Just shut up.

505
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,030
See? I annoy you.

506
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,540
Now,
you gonna give me the results
or are you gonna...

507
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,070
(SIGHS)

508
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,980
Intracranial EEG showed
no electrical abnormalities.

509
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,780
Which means it's autoimmune.
No.

510
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,150
It also showed
his entire right
hemisphere is brain-dead.

511
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,930
So while you guys
were worrying about me,
half this kid's brain died.

512
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,670
The only solace you
should take from this
is the fact that it didn't.

513
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,800
Garden variety EEG sucks
compared to
the in-brain variety,

514
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,310
but it's not going
to miss brain death.

515
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,280
He's gotten worse.
Not that much worse.

516
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,710
Respiration is depressed.

517
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,680
Seizures are increasing,
one every five minutes.

518
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,870
Not that much worse.

519
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,910
He can still talk
and he's left-handed,

520
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,540
which means speech
is in the right side.

521
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,990
You don't know how
Patrick's brain reorganized
itself 25 years ago.

522
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,320
What if the right side
is just a little dead?

523
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,730
Maybe he still has
random neurons firing.

524
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,890
You're just looking for
a puzzle to distract you
from your own situation.

525
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,730
You're right, he's dead.
Let's go home.

526
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,030
What did you find out?

527
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,230
Is he gonna be okay?

528
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,340
I'm sorry.
Yes!

529
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,350
What's this?

530
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,820
A piano.

531
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,950
What's this?

532
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,090
He's obviously lost use...

533
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,320
Shut up.

534
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,810
Music is a global process.

535
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,380
You can't play
the piano with half a brain.

536
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,280
What's it mean?

537
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,950
Means the right side of
his brain has always sucked.

538
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,390
Means it's not relevant
to what's going on now.

539
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,520
Wow. Then it's autoimmune.
Yeah.

540
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,330
Question is what
do we do about it?

541
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,700
Most likely ones we can fix.

542
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,200
Polyarteritis nodosa,
Takayasu or Sarcoid.

543
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,970
I'll start treatment.

544
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,470
Not what I was talking about.

545
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,170
But, yeah, you do that.

546
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,110
Your turn?

547
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,180
Do you have to do that?

548
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,020
You mean cheapen
everyone's attempt
at a human moment

549
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:59,190
by identifying
the real calculations
that go into it?

550
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,450
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

551
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,500
I'm sorry you're dying,
I'm gonna hug you.

552
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,230
Anything to say?

553
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,570
If you're considering
grabbing my ass,

554
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,270
don't start anything
you can't finish.

555
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,810
Well, as long as
we're just standing here,
you mind if we work?

556
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,870
How's the kid's
treatment going?

557
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,120
Are you crying?

558
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,350
No.

559
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,550
Respiration rate's up.

560
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,020
Seizures are calming down.
It's all good.

561
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,500
Not for what
I'm gonna do next.

562
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,120
There is no next.
He's gonna be fine.

563
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,070
Only if he wants to
remain a four-year-old
who wets his bed.

564
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,240
There's nothing else for him.

565
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,430
There's better.
Thanks for the hug.

567
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,650
(DOORBELL CONTINUES BUZZING)

568
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,760
It's the middle of the night.

569
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,560
You knew I'd be asleep.

570
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,930
Phone would have woken you up
just as much.

571
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,800
And I can't see
what you're wearing
on the phone.

572
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,570
My patient with the 55 IQ
has Takayasu syndrome.

573
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,810
Very uncommon.

574
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,850
Happens mostly
in Asian women.

575
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,680
Takayasu is
manageable with steroids,
which you already know.

576
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,620
So I assume you're here
for something else.

577
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,880
My patient also has
a significant
seizure problem.

578
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,520
Also manageable with
anticonvulsant medication.

579
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,190
Yes, and if he
kept taking his
anticonvulsant medication,

580
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,890
he could go back on tour
and play the piano.

581
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,060
But a hemispherectomy

582
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,300
would completely stop
the right-brain seizure
activity

583
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,900
and he would no
longer need to take

584
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,440
his anticonvulsant medication.

585
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,170
You want to remove
half his brain?

586
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,440
The right half.

587
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,070
It would be irresponsible
to remove the left.

588
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,670
You don't remove half a brain
and gain function!

589
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,280
Not my brain.
But his? Who knows? What?

590
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,990
Let's say that
I'm the left side
of Patrick's brain.

591
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,180
I'm quick-witted,
I'm charming,
I'm great looking.

592
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,990
You're the right
side of his brain.

593
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,760
You're useless, old, damaged.

594
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,260
We go to a bar for a drink.

595
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,860
Now, I have the mad skills
to be scoring
all the hot babes,

596
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,700
but instead I'm
spending my time
wiping drool off your chin

597
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,800
and making sure
you don't eat the tablecloth.

598
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,200
What's the father want to do?

599
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,900
I don't know.

600
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,410
So go wake him up.

601
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,450
House, I'm so sorry.

602
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,720
Forgot I was dying, huh?

603
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,490
I'm here if you need me.

604
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,420
I need you.

605
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:03,610
One small feel for man,
one giant ass for mankind.

606
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,440
Thanks.

607
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,610
Good luck in Boston.

608
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,650
Call
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

609
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,560
Dr. Foreman was just here.

610
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,730
The seizures have
almost completely gone away.

611
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,100
Says we might be
able to go home
in the next day or two.

612
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,730
Thank you so much.

613
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,540
I think we should remove
the right side of
your son's brain.

614
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,010
I thought you fixed him.

615
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,170
Does he look fixed?

616
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,550
The right side of his brain is
keeping him walking straight.

617
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,590
Other than that,
it's been dead weight
ever since the accident.

618
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,990
If we remove it,
the seizures
would stop completely.

619
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,750
The seizures are
hardly noticeable.

620
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,490
They don't bother Patrick.

621
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,220
But without the seizures,

622
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,560
the left side
would have a chance
to actually function.

623
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,900
It could learn
to do new things.

624
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,670
Only bummer,
he'd never play
the piano again.

625
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,540
Oh, no.
The piano is everything.

626
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,270
I'm not saying
he's never
gonna work for NASA,

627
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,810
but flipping burgers
isn't out of the question.

628
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,440
Well, I don't mind
taking care of him
so he can play the piano.

629
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,850
No, you're actually lucky.

630
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,440
You don't have to
watch your kid grow up.

631
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,990
You don't have to let go.

632
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,080
You trying to
make this about me?

633
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,490
I love my son,
just the way he is!

634
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,690
He's a monkey
grinder at the circus.

635
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,390
He's worked hard
to get where he...

636
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,020
So does the monkey.

637
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,900
The piano is
a neurological accident.

638
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,200
He has a gift.

639
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,970
I'm offering him a life.

640
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,210
It's up to you.

641
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,190
I've isolated
the cancer proteins
in House's CSF.

642
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
About time.
We can't let him go to Boston

643
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,300
if he qualifies
for the Duke trial.

644
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,060
You want to do it?

645
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,280
Damn. He's negative
for protein PHF.

646
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,350
He doesn't qualify.

647
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,470
What's that?
That shouldn't be there.

648
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,770
Patrick?

649
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,910
Hello, Papa.

650
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,640
Patrick,
I have a question for you.

651
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,540
Yes?

652
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,840
Are you happy?

653
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,020
Are you happy?

00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,660
You don't have cancer.

659
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,860
There was
an abnormal presence of lgG
and lgM, indicating...

660
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,990
I don't have neurosyphilis.
My MRI showed nothing...

661
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,160
It's a gumma in your brain.
It's very rare not
to be in the liver,

662
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,260
and I'm really glad
we never slept together but...

663
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,830
We would have used a condom.

664
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,000
And I don't have syphilis.
My VDRL was negative...

665
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,630
We did an FTA
antibody test.

666
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,940
The VDRL was
a false negative.

667
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,110
You're not going to die.

668
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,170

IV antibiotics.

669
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,380
Did you send these
results to Mass General?

670
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,020
Of course.

671
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,090
You idiots.

you celebrating?

00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,840
Because it
wasn't my damn file.

678
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,570
You faked cancer?

Feel free to tell his wife
that he's not gonna die

but he is cheating on her.

Why would you want us
to think that you...

683
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,580
I didn't!

684
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,090
I wanted the guys in Boston
to think that I had cancer.

685
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,750
I wanted the guys who were
gonna implant a cool drug

686
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,490
right into the pleasure center
of my brain to think
that I had cancer!

687
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,460
You faked cancer to get high?

688
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,600
I'm going to bed.

689
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,280
You're right.
I don't like you.

690
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,810
Sure. Now that I'm not dying.

691
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,430

hemispherectomy went well.

He's unconscious but...

694
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,700
How depressed are you?

695
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,240
I'm not depressed.

696
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,740
You faked cancer.

697
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,180
It was
an outpatient procedure.

698
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,510
I was curious.

699
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,450
Are you curious about heroin?

700
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,780
Not since last year's
Christmas party.

701
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,790
I know this goes
against your nature,

702
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,160
but can we not
make too much of this?

703
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,160
You made people think
that you were going to die!

704
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,320
I didn't make them.

705
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,760
I tried to hide it,

706
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,460
but you idiots needed to
get into my business.

707
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,140
I'm sure I'll regret asking,
but why are you laughing?

708
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,710
It's ironic.

709
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,900
Well, I'm sure I'll
regret asking, but why...

710
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,240
Depression in
cancer patients...

711
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,940
It's not as
common as you think.

712
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,580
It's not the dying
that gets to people.

713
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,380
It's the dying alone.
The patients with family,
with friends,

714
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,320
they tend to do okay.

715
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,490
You don't have cancer.

716
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,520
You do have
people who give a damn.

717
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,060
So what do you do?

718
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:43,930
You fake the cancer,
then push
the people who care away.

719
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,470
Because they're boring.

720
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,650
Go home to your hotel room
and laugh at that irony.

721
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,980
Start small, House.
Take a chance.

722
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,810
Maybe something
that doesn't involve
sticking stuff in your brain.

723
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,690
Pizza with a friend.

724
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,590
A movie. Something.

725
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,640
Follow my finger.
Do you know your name?

726
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,160
His speech center
was on the right side.

727
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,660
It'll be a while
before he's talking.

728
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,220
He hasn't
really done anything

729
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,600
except to stare off
into the distance.

730
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,400
It'll take some time to...

731
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,510
You buttoned your shirt.

732
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,390
He looks happy.

733
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,660
