1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,690
Try not to be scared
when you see him, okay?

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,830
Mom, I've seen him sick.
I'm not scared.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,130
This time's different.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,430
The doctors gave him
an extra course of
radiation and chemo...

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,870
I know.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,640
And you understand
how proud we are of you,
right?

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,440
Gloves, mask.

8
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,320
Matty, you said you wanted
to see your brother
before the procedure.

9
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,090
I know I look like an alien,
but I promise not to eat
your brain.

10
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,800
(CHUCKLES)

11
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,700
When this is done,
will you be able to
play out back with me?

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,130
I'll rip anything you
put near the strike zone.

13
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,730
Let your brother rest up,
while we take
some of your marrow.

14
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,640
You don't need to be
in an isolation room,

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,020
but I pulled some strings
so you could be next door
to your brother.

16
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,520
How many games will I miss?

17
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,250
Well, you only have to
be here overnight,

18
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,850
but you do have to
take it easy for a little bit.

19
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,260
I already missed two.
Matty...

20
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,060
I know. It's okay.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,860
It must have been a drag.

22
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,090
We just had to make sure
you weren't exposed
to any bugs,

23
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,400
because your healthy bone
marrow is what's gonna cure
your brother's leukemia.

24
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,950
(GROWLS)

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,130
Go on.

26
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,860
(BARKING)

27
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,170
CHASE: He sneezed.
Maybe it's just an allergy.

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,470
Not with an enlarged spleen
and a fever.

29
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,340
WILSON: He's got one of 10,000
possible infections,

30
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,780
even if it's just the common
cold, I do the transplant,
he kills his brother.

31
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,870
How long do we have?

32
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,920
Radiation obliterated
his immune system.

33
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,550
Even in a clean room,
he's got four, maybe five,
days left.

34
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,560
No way we can solve this
that fast. You need to find
another donor.

35
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,720
They're African American.

36
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,920
It makes it nearly impossible
to find a full match.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,430
Tell me about it.
I can't even find the one
I've got working for me.

38
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,130
Where is Foreman?

39
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,400
Nothing like a dead patient
to send you back
to your choir boy roots.

40
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,020
Hey, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

41
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,250
Wilson just killed a kid
same way you did.

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,550
He's not dead.

43
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,030
Five days are gonna fly by.
He didn't look both ways
before he nuked.

44
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,630
You done talking to
your imaginary friend?

45
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,690
Because I thought, maybe,
you could do
your job and just...

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Start the donor brother
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

47
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,770
Great idea,
if you're looking to
save exactly one kid.

48
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,330
Broad-spec will take
at least a week to work.
We need narrow-spec.

49
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,430
How old is Hector?

50
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,410
Our patient's name is Matty.
His brother's Nick.

51
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,950
Hector's my dog.
He's about 17?

52
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,180
Seventeen? That's, like,
a 119 in human years.
Why is he still alive?

53
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,550
Five days minus 20 seconds
talking about Wilson's dog.

54
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,680
We need to start testing.
Stool samples for parasites,
antibody tests...

55
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,750
Blood panel was negative
for all the usual suspects.

56
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,890
That's because the
infection is too small.

57
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,800
We start testing now,
it's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

58
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,700
We draw blood odds are
we're just gonna
come up with hay.

59
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,030
We need to
grow more needles.

60
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,540
Okay, that probably needs
further explanation.

61
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,310
We make the donor kid sicker.

62
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,850
We freeze him, we soak him,
break down his immune system.

63
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,250
Suddenly we're looking at
some needle that a camel
can pass through the eye of.

64
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,290
Making him sicker risks
spreading the infection
all throughout his body.

65
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,120
True, but who cares?

66
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,680
Once we know what
the infection is, we'll know
exactly how to treat it.

67
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,450
As long as he isn't dead yet,
we're cool.

68
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,020
We should do
what we normally do.

69
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,190
Go to the kid's house,
check for sources
of the infection.

70
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,790
Waste of time.

71
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,430
You think it's in the house.
I know it's in the patient.

72
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,490
Safer than
intentionally making
the kid sicker.

73
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,640
Fine, go.

74
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,480
So exactly how sick
are you gonna make Matty?

75
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,950
He could get quite ill.

76
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,180
It certainly won't be a
pleasant experience for
anyone, but it's our only...

77
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,050
Ever get caught in the rain
without an umbrella?

78
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,220
That's all we're
talking about here.
Sign the form.

79
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,030
It's a little more complicated
than that. We'll also be
doing leukopheresis.

80
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,030
We run Matty's blood through
a machine that filters out
his white blood cells.

81
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,660
But without his white cells,
how could he get better
in time?

82
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,710
We'll pump the white
blood cells back as soon as
we have a diagnosis.

83
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,440
Then we should be able to cure
the infection in time
to do the transplant.

84
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,700
But you can't guarantee?

85
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,770
We're not GM.
No recalls, no rebates.

86
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,110
Anymore questions
while your son's life
slips away?

87
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,080
You really think
we should do this?

88
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,390
Yes.

89
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,360
Sorry. Your patient,
you tell them.

90
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,720
This is your family.
It needs to be your decision.

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,710
All you had to do was
say, "Yes, I do."

92
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,410
God knows it's a phrase
that you've used
often enough in your life.

93
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,470
It was a mistake every time.
Give it a break.
They said yes.

94
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,920
That's not enough for you.
You need them to feel good
about saying yes.

95
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,050
I treat patients for months,
maybe years,
not weeks, like you.

96
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,110
I'm taller.

97
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,750
If they don't trust me,
I can't do my job.

98
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,590
The only value of that trust
is that you can
manipulate them.

99
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,930
You should write
greeting cards.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,870
Giving the parents a chance
to make a bad choice
was a bad choice.

101
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,370
At least it would have
been their choice.

102
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,530
One they'd regret
at their son's funeral.

103
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,310
Kitchen and bathrooms were
immaculate. Whatever the kid's
got, he didn't get here.

104
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,410
No, whatever the kid got,
he didn't get from
the kitchen or the bathroom.

105
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,040
Nobody cleans swing sets.

106
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,990
Yeah, because their kid's 10
and hasn't used it
since he was six.

107
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,050
You obviously think your time
could be better spent.
Why'd you come along?

108
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,890
You feel bad about
what happened last week.

109
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,330
I'm handling it.

110
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,920
Think the family's gonna sue?

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,300
She only had her grandparents,
and they weren't close.

112
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,730
Well, that's good.
For you, I mean.

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,360
A lawsuit makes it even harder
to put behind you.

114
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,460
You put yours behind you?

115
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,570
Nope.

116
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,910
When I woke up
this morning I...

117
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,540
I couldn't remember
what she was wearing
when I admitted her.

118
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,780
Memories fade.

119
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,950
I killed her a week ago and
I can't remember what color
top she was wearing.

120
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,920
I was grateful when
I could wake up
not thinking about her.

121
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,050
I'm not like you.

122
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,580
Your patient died because
you were distracted
over the death of your dad.

123
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,560
I made a calculated decision.

124
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,060
You acted like a human being.
I acted like House.

125
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,510
Could be <i>Mucor</i> or
Strongyloides in this dirt.

126
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,550
No pulmonary symptoms,
setting well,
breathing easily.

127
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,310
Mom, I'm freezing.

128
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,780
How long do I have to wait?

129
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,480
Matty, we found
an old water pump
in your backyard.

130
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,540
You ever drink from it?

131
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,420
Yeah it was gross.

132
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,720
We gotta test
for Mycobacteria,
leptospirosis.

133
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,320
When did you drink the water?

134
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,790
Last summer?

135
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,860
You sure?
You haven't even taken
a sip to cool off?

136
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,070
It was really gross.

137
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,670
My shoulder's bugging me.
Does that matter?

138
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,370
It could. Did you
do anything to hurt it?

139
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,940
Just threw the ball around
the other day,
for a couple hours.

140
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,950
It's probably just
a muscle ache.
Let us know if it gets worse.

141
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,850
So soreness and stuff,
that's not 'cause I'm sick?

142
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
Is something else bugging you?

143
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,390
Sort of.

144
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,760
He has acute scrotum.
Adorable.

145
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,300
Please, I thought you
were dignified.

146
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,470
Come on,
how am I not supposed to
make that joke?

147
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,440
Best thing about big,
honking gonads, well,
one of the best things,

148
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,910
is that there's only
a few infections
that could cause it.

149
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,320
Do urinalysis and cultures for
<i>E. Coli, Klebsiella,</i>
TB, and <i>Brucella.</i>

150
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,120
Blood tests
for enteroviruses
and adenoviruses.

151
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,350
Hopefully, the needles
have grown as fast as
his sack, and we can find it.

152
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,480
Can Chase and Cameron
cover that?

153
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,330
Mind if I ask why?

154
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,200
I want to recheck the
National Marrow registry
for an alternate donor.

155
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,800
In case we're wrong?

156
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,360
It's been known to happen.

157
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,900
Fine, go.

158
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,550
Negative for <i>E. Coli</i> and TB.
Why is House taking
it easy on Foreman?

159
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,610
He deserves a break.

160
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,550
Yeah, House is all about
giving breaks to people
in need.

161
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,520
No on <i>Klebsiella.</i>

162
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,830
And it's Tuesday.

163
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,530
It's got nothing to do with
Foreman or House. It's just...

164
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,930
It's the day I remind you
I like you, and I want us
to be together.

165
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,930
Thank you, I'd forgotten.

166
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,200
No on <i>Brucella</i>
and both viral antibodies.

167
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,080
You're really gonna
do this every Tuesday?

168
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,210
You take the day off,
I'll pick it up on Wednesday.

169
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,050
What if we're looking for
the wrong thing?

170
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,220
These are the only infections
that cause swollen testicles.

171
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,920
Why don't you just say it
four times now and leave me
alone for a month?

172
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,660
Well, what if it's
not an infection?

173
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,030
His temperature's through
the roof. There's mucous
pouring out of him.

174
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,530
I know he has an infection,
but what if it didn't directly
cause the scrotum issue?

175
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,940
What if it just caused
the thing that caused
the scrotum issue?

176
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,130
CK-MB is elevated.

177
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,910
Slightly.
There's nothing wrong with...

178
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,310
Indicates cardiac injury.

179
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,180
We stuck him in that room, put
his stupid, little runny-nose
infection into hyperdrive.

180
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,480
What if it went to his heart?

181
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,090
CHASE: Pulmonary valve
looks clean.

182
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,030
Wait. Stop. Mitral valve,
there's a growth.

183
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,030
He'll need a month
of antibiotics to clear that.

184
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,040
His brother only has
four days to live.

185
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,280
The infection in Matty's
mitral valve rules him out
as a donor.

186
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,440
This is perfect.

187
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,180
We drove the infection
into his heart.

188
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,590
Okay, perfect is too strong
of a word, but it's very,
very good.

189
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,990
Now we know
where the infection is.

190
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,860
All we've got to do is remove
the valve, ID the infection,
target and destroy it.

191
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,020
Remove the valve?

192
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,860
He'll be fine on antibiotics.
He doesn't need open-heart
surgery.

193
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,200
He'll be heartbroken,
on account of
his dead brother.

194
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,900
Either way he's got a dead
brother. The infection
isn't just in the valve.

195
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,410
Even with targeted medication,

196
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
there's no way
we can clear his system
in time.

197
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,140
We don't have to.
We have to clear his marrow.

198
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,510
After the surgery,
we harvest the marrow,

199
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,020
marinate it in the targeted
antibiotic, simmer and serve.

200
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,960
Could work.
It's insane.

201
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,350
It is better than
a dead brother.

202
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,890
I'm running this by Cuddy.

203
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,150
Fine. Go.
In fact, let's all go.

204
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,270
This surgery is dangerous
and life-altering,

205
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,240
and clearly not in
the interest of our patient.

206
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,740
It is, if he
likes his brother.

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,170
We have a conflict
of interests.

208
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,300
WILSON: The parents don't.
FOREMAN: Of course they do.

209
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,310
They already sacrificed
Matty's health to benefit
his brother once.

210
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,900
They made his cold worse.

211
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,380
We screwed up his heart valve
by making his cold worse.

212
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,010
Do you have anything
to add to this debate?

213
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,570
Wilson's right.
Foreman's wrong.

214
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,490
Your shirt is way too
revealing for the office.

215
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,750
What do you want me to do?

216
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,920
We should call child services
and have them appoint
a guardian for Matty.

217
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,190
No.

218
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,060
Go explain the choices
to the parents, and don't
let House bully them.

219
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,900
House.

220
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,930
Did he really think
I was gonna do that?
I didn't.

221
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,100
Then, why did you let him...

222
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,610
I'm trying to
cut him some slack.

223
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,340
Nice of you.

224
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,110
I think he's got the yips.

225
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,920
Steve Blass, Scott Norwood,
David Duval all got the yips.

226
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,080
Great athletes, lost their
confidence and immediately
started sucking.

227
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,420
And you're giving him time
to work through it?

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,330
Four days, and he's fired.

229
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,960
You don't get better
from the yips.

230
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,970
Open-heart surgery?

231
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,270
If you want both kids to live,
it's the only choice.

232
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,810
Due to the valve replacement.

233
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,970
Matty will have to be
on blood thinners
to prevent potential clots.

234
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,480
For how long?
Forever.

235
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,150
He couldn't participate
in contact sports, because of
the risk of hemorrhage.

236
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,090
What about the
marrow registry?
Maybe they'll find a match.

237
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,150
Maybe they'll ride it here
on a unicorn.

238
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,250
I'm afraid finding
a viable new donor

239
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,590
isn't something we can
realistically depend on.

240
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,340
Either we cripple one son,
or kill the other.

241
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,400
He won't be able to play
baseball. That doesn't
make him a cripple.

242
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,980
What should we do?

243
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,790
You should protect
your family as a whole.
You should do the surgery.

244
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,000
That was awesome.
Shut up.

245
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,720
I gotta start
pretending to care.

246
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,560
I did exactly what
Cuddy told us not to do.

247
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,800
No you didn't.
You did exactly what
she told me not to do.

248
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,860
You're completely
in the clear.

249
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,070
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

250
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,340
You're actually upset.
You just said
what you believed.

251
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,570
I also believe in patients
making their own choices.

252
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,940
Because it lessens your guilt
if things go wrong.

253
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,880
You're not protecting
their choices. You're
soothing your conscience.

254
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,120
By that logic, a sociopath
would make the best patient
advocate in the world.

255
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,220
Am I blushing?

256
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,030
You ready?

257
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,730
Yeah.

258
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,530
Thanks.

259
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,200
You'd do the same for me.

260
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,550
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

261
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,850
You think I'll be
better in time to pitch
in the playoffs?

262
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,620
Maybe next season.

263
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,430
We should have told him.

264
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,520
He loves his brother,
but if he understood what
we were asking of him...

265
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,260
He loves his brother more than
he loves baseball.

266
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,330
You did the right thing.

267
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,110
Putting any part
of this decision on him...

268
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,410
It's impossible for you guys
to deal with this.

269
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,950
How's a 10-year-old
supposed to do it?

270
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,130
Canula in place.

271
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,630
Sutures are holding.

272
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,570
We're all set to go.

273
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,940
Switch him over to bypass.

274
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,270
<i>(WOMAN CHATTERING ON TV)</i>

275
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,000
(PHONE RINGING)

276
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,540
Yeah?
I didn't do the surgery.

277
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,980
You woke me up
to tell me that you're lazy?

278
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,110
We biopsied a piece
before we started cutting.

279
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm tired. Get to the point.

280
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,920
We didn't replace the valve

281
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,760
because the growth
was fibrous tissue.
It wasn't infectious.

282
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,320
<i>We've got to be wrong about...</i>

283
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,730
Oh, God.
What?

284
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,960
<i>You know what's wrong</i>
<i>with Matty?</i>

285
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,760
I think Hector's
committed suicide.

286
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,890
What are you talking about?

287
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,060
He took some pills.

288
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,630
Is he alive?

289
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,400
He ate half my stash.

290
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,400
Of course he's...

291
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,040
(GRUNTS)

292
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,450
He's stoned. I'll be right in.

293
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,960
We cut all the way
into this kid's heart,

294
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,760
and all we got was this lousy,
non-infectious fibrous tissue.

295
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,390
How did we miss this?

296
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,400
Matty had a fever.
He got sicker when we
suppressed his immune system.

297
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,840
That all points to infection.

298
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not our fault. Fibrous tissue.

299
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,640
Something is turning
his healthy heart valve
into gristle.

300
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,880
Fibrous tissue,
enlarged spleen, fever...
Could mean autoimmune.

301
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,350
Autoimmune diseases
aren't passed along
in bone marrow.

302
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,890
He can still donate.
We confirm, I do the surgery.

303
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,520
Lupus and Behçet's are
our best bet.
Do an ANA and pathergy test.

304
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,690
Or it could be infection.

305
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,560
My memory's not
what it used to be,

306
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,000
but didn't we just
rule that out
eight seconds ago?

307
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,870
Just because it's not
what screwed up his valve,

308
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,370
it doesn't mean
it's not in his system.

309
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,100
Uh-huh, and has the obvious
advantage of making us right
all along.

310
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,340
Little disadvantage
of making big brother dead.

311
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,040
That's your argument?
A better outcome?

312
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,170
It fits.

313
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,550
The family has one kid
with leukemia
and one with autoimmune.

314
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,110
I wouldn't stand next to them
in a rain storm.

315
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,310
That's your argument?
It sucks for them?

316
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,480
It fits, and we can
still help big brother.

317
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,890
National Marrow Registry
came up with four
out of six donors.

318
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,590
Six out of six is two better
than four out of six, right?

319
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,430
I mean, I know two
is so small,

320
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,020
but since it means that
he's gonna get
Graft-Versus-Host Disease,

321
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,560
the marrow will
attack his body, and he'll
die a painful death.

322
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,330
Find out what
autoimmune it is.

323
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,180
Is this autoimmune
better or worse than
the new heart valve?

324
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,880
It depends on which autoimmune
it is. With early detection,
most are manageable.

325
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,350
How long will testing take?

326
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,750
That's the other good thing
about this.

327
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,790
There's literally
thousands of
possible infections,

328
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,020
but only a handful of
autoimmune conditions.

329
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,690
We'll have the answer
in a few hours.

330
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,230
NICK: Hey, Doctor?

331
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,630
Is this bad?

332
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,940
Wanna catch a movie?

333
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,340
It's one in the morning.

334
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,010
I know a place.

335
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,980
Although, I wouldn't recommend
wearing those shoes.

336
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,610
How exactly does a dog
unscrew a bottle of pills?

337
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,780
Is that a riddle?

338
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,350
It requires
an opposable thumb.

339
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,520
I must have left it off.

340
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,650
On the floor?

341
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,290
I think he hopped up
onto the bathroom counter.

342
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,730
He has arthritis.

343
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,430
Not me this time.

344
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,030
No! It's your damn dog.

345
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,240
He chews everything.
I was missing a file.
Found paper in his stool.

346
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,340
An original Sun Record 78
Elvis recording, gone.

347
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,210
Who the hell chews vinyl?
He's vindictive.

348
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,480
He's had a good, long life.
It's his time.

349
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,020
Are you okay?

350
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,680
I just tripped over
Wilson's self-righteousness.

351
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,450
What do you got?

352
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,190
Matty's negative
for everything.
It's not autoimmune.

353
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,590
So, we're back to infection.

354
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,960
Nick's starting to deteriorate
fast. He's got bruising
all over his arms.

355
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,470
His capillaries
are leaking blood.

356
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,970
If it happens in his brain,
he's dead.

357
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,730
We've got to go
with the four-out-of-six
donor.

358
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,510
Did I mention my concerns
about four being less
than six?

359
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,010
Wilson's first wife
ignored a similar issue.

360
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
Of course, that time,
it was only fatal
to their marriage.

361
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,350
It's either that, or we start
randomly testing Matty
for infections.

362
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,910
I know how you hate
the word "random."

363
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,850
Do it alphabetically.
We're not doing
that damn transplant.

364
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,190
Where's Foreman?

365
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,820
We've found a donor.

366
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,960
It's not an ideal match,
but four out of six
still gives Nick a chance.

367
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,840
A partial match transplant
is extremely dangerous.

368
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,070
Doctor Foreman explained...

369
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,770
Did he also explain
what sort of pain
your son will experience

370
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,410
if he gets
Graft-Versus-Host Disease?

371
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,640
Yes.

372
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,190
Apparently,
he didn't explain it
vividly enough.

373
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,240
Let me give it a whack...

374
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,950
He also explained that if we
did nothing, Nick could start
bleeding into his brain.

375
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,220
Matty is a perfect match.
Just give us a little more
time to figure out...

376
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,350
How much time?

377
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,260
Doctor House is
the best diagnostician...

378
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,130
How much time?

379
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,930
I don't know.

380
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,440
And Nick can start
bleeding into his brain
without any warning?

381
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,440
Yes, but the chances of
complications from
a mismatch are...

382
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,570
My boys have suffered enough.

383
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,440
Get Matty better,

384
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,850
and give Nick the transplant
from the new donor.

385
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,180
Foreman screwed us.

386
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,630
No, you screwed us.

387
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,830
What is the point
in being able to
control people

388
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,990
if you won't actually do it?

389
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,700
It's like training a dog and
letting him go on your rug,
which, by the way...

390
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,670
Once Foreman got his mitts
on them, well,
there was no way...

391
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,570
You don't explain chances
and probabilities,
you lie to them.

392
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,550
You tell them Foreman's
a moron, which isn't even
much of a lie right now.

393
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,670
You've got to talk to him.

394
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,980
I've got no problem
with what Foreman did.

395
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,240
He undercut us,
and he may have cost
that kid his life.

396
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,980
Foreman did what he thought
was right. You, on the
other hand, sucked out.

397
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,110
When the decision
really mattered,

398
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,180
you didn't have the guts
to tell them what to do.

399
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,660
If that kid dies,
it's because Foreman
was wrong,

400
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,860
and because you're a coward.

401
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,030
Oh, goodness,
I've left my door open.

402
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:39,200
My poor dog must have
run away and been hit by
a car or a truck or a train.

403
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,240
Or an anvil.

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,250
A little itchy.

It's weird, huh?

You still have no idea
what's wrong with me,

but those meds will
make me better.

We put you on a variety
of medications that will fight
all kinds of infections.

415

Nick, you know exactly
what's wrong with him,

416
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,540
but maybe he's gonna die,
anyway.

Hopefully,
the new marrow will...

I can't go in there, can I?

419
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,020
Your infection would kill him.

420
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,390
So, I won't be able to
be with him when he dies?

421

You'll be able to be with him

at a medical supply store

Okay. What do you got
in bitching?

sick is now all that sick.

Schistocytes on the smear?

Marilyn Manson

his bone marrow.

We need to stop Matty's meds.

460

it's the meds. If it doesn't,
it's an infection.

We know what he has.
We know how to treat it.

We're doing it,
it's not working.
Life is for the living.

478
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,560
Matty's been off his meds
for a few hours, but his
blood count's still tanking.

479
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,830
Means the meds
aren't to blame.
It's the infection.

480
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,060
If we don't get this
under control, his blood will
literally turn into water.

481
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,800
Cultures still
aren't growing anything.

482
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,900
Why not?

483
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,510
Because you did the
right thing. Convinced
the parents to treat the kid.

484
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,550
All you did
was yank the weed
out of the ground.

485
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,250
Its roots are still killing
their beautiful lawn.
We just can't see it.

486
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,120
If we can't see it,
we don't know what it is.

487
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,220
If we don't know what it is,
we can't kill it.

488
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,690
So we got to wait for it
to grow back again.

489
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,360
Now, the soil is arid.

490
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,560
So with he and his brother
we'll be dead by the time...

491
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,680
What if the dandelion
was in fertile soil?

492
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,610
What if we take the roots
from Matty,
and put them in Nick?

493
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,150
Turn the kid into
a petri dish, only better.

494
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,880
A petri dish can't
tell you when it hurts.

495
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,150
You want to give him
his brother's infection?

496
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,750
The very thing we've been
trying to avoid
since the brother sneezed?

497
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,260
Leukemia kid's
got no defenses.

498
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,760
Which is why he'll die.

499
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,800
But before he does,
the infection
will spread fast.

500
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,800
Fast enough to tell us
what it is, in time to
save his brother.

501
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,100
Do you see any other way?

502
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,270
WILSON: The infection
is decimating
Matty's bone marrow.

503
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,150
But if we give that marrow
to Nick, his symptoms
could let us diagnose Matty.

504
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,490
But, it'll kill Nick.
Yes.

505
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,690
You're...

506
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,290
You're saying we should
kill one son to
save the other?

507
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,800
Nick is gonna die either way.

508
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,130
You don't know that.
I mean, he's in pain
right now, but...

509
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,000
Nick's Graft-Versus-Host
is not responding
to medication.

510
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,870
That can change.

511
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,400
Maybe he... He'll rally.

512
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,310
Hey, my Nick is a fighter.

513
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,280
Graft-Versus-Host
isn't gonna go away

514
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,910
because of Nick's sunny smile
and positive outlook.

515
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,420
Nick has survived
three reoccurrences
of his leukemia.

516
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,820
He's being torn apart
from the inside out.

517
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,290
His pain's gonna get worse
and worse, until he dies.

518
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,520
You're just dragging it out.

519
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,490
You have only
one decision to make.

520
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,900
You can leave here
with one dead son, or two.

521
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,040
Tell them.

522
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,140
You should let us do this.

523
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,320
No!

524
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,260
We're not giving up on Nick.

525
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,060
Not!

526
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,650
The patient's parents
apparently don't want to be
parents anymore.

527
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,680
You're a sneaky bastard.
Any ideas how
we get around this?

528
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,230
Court order?
It's hardly sneaky.

529
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,960
We can still save Matty.

530
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,860
Run more tests,
find out what infection
is destroying his marrow.

531
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:55,370
Ten-thousand possible
infections at least
20 minutes per test

532
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,030
it'll take you
approximately eight years.

533
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,510
Actually, four months,
assuming the last one I test
is the right one,

534
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,130
and, if it's the first,
it will take me approximately
20 minutes.

535
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,870
He's right. It's worth a shot.

536
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,710
He's timid.
Testing blindly is not
gonna save this kid.

537
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,180
But standing around here will.

538
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,440
(NICK GROANING)

539
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,750
Wow, he sure is hurting.

540
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,790
The nurses say he maxed out
on his pain meds.

541
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,120
If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that...

542
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,160
Pharmacy's
on the ground floor.

543
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,300
I'm gonna go get you
some more pain medication,
okay?

544
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,860
Thank you.

545
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,980
It's not gonna help.

546
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,750
You're dying.

547
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,320
Nothing's gonna change that.
These drugs will just
make you go easier.

548
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,820
I know.

549
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,130
Fourteen years on the planet,
most of them spent suffering.

550
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:40,540
Dying before you even
got to drive a car,

551
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,510
take off a girl's bra,
drink a beer.

552
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,440
Believe me, there's plenty
you haven't done.

553
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,480
Really good stuff.

554
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,680
Must make it hard
to believe in God,

555
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,130
or fairness, larger purpose.

556
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,690
But your life
doesn't have to be
meaningless.

557
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,300
You can save your brother.

558
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,830
How?

559
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,480
FOREMAN: Negative for CMV.

560
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,070
WILSON: Negative for amoebas.

561
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,140
House called you timid.

562
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,840
He's called me a lot worse.

563
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,150
To him, there is
nothing worse.
He's gonna fire you.

564
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,950
Even if we run 100 tests,

565
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,550
that only gives us
a one percent chance
of saving these kids.

566
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,620
Better than zero.
You don't care
if you get fired?

567
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,720
I don't know.

568
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,790
There's got to be a way to
better our odds from
a 99-percent chance of death.

569
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,890
You've got to know.

570
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,460
It's not food-borne,
because no one else
in the family is sick.

571
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,160
You either care about
your job, or you don't.

572
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,730
And Matty's the only one
who drank from that water
pump in the back yard,

573
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,430
and we eliminated <i>Pseudomonas</i>
and cholera.

574
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,740
If you care,
you fight to keep it.
If you don't, you quit.

575
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,610
I thought they lived
in the suburbs.

576
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,150
They do. Why?

577
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,510
And they've got a water pump?

578
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,460
NICK: Please, I...
I want to do it.

579
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,260
No, Nicky,
it's not your decision.

580
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,360
I'm dying.
There's nothing that's
gonna change that.

581
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:19,390
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't say that. Okay?
You can't give up.

582
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,000
It's time for me to go, Dad.

583
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,410
You got to let me go.

584
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,910
No.

585
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,520
Please, son.

586
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,150
I can't... I can't...
I can't!

587
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,390
Let me do it for Matty.
Let me do it for you guys.

588
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,560
So you won't be alone.

589
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,770
Are you sure?

590
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,710
No, but he is.

591
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,420
Get Nick back
to the clean room.

592
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,120
The parents agreed
to infect him.

593
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,030
We figured out
what's wrong with Matty,
histoplasmosis.

594
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,000
Well, what is that?
I mean, why did it...

595
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,900
Fungal infection.
It grows in chicken feces.

596
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,940
The dirt that Matty used
to build his pitcher's mound

597
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,770
must have sat under
a chicken coop.

598
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,670
Your whole neighborhood
was built on top of farmland.

599
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,400
We didn't test for it earlier,
because we didn't...

600
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,710
Can you fix him?

601
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,040
Full course of amphotericin
and he should be fine.

602
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,550
And Nick?
I mean, can you clean
Matty's marrow?

603
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:43,720
Just like you were talking
about doing it, but do it
fast, and get it into Nick.

604
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,890
I'm sorry, the reason
Matty is so sick is

605
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,060
because the infection
is attacking his marrow.

606
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,800
He doesn't have enough left
to safely take from him
and give to his brother.

607
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,140
I'm gonna get better now?
That's it?

608
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,080
That's it.

609
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,550
And what about Nick?

610
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,820
Your brother was willing
to risk his life to save you.

611
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,380
Are you willing to
do that for him?

612
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,490
I can't sedate you.
You're too sick.

613
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,330
(SCREAMING)

614
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,540
Please, please stop. Please.
Please. You're done, right?

615
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,100
Sorry, I need a lot more.

616
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,520
No, stop! Stop!

617
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,360
How much heat are you taking
from the parents?

618
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,560
They're calming down.

619
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,860
I think it has something to do
with both their kids being
alive, awake, and eating.

620
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,060
The marrow transplant took.

621
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,530
Welcome back, Foreman.

622
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,730
You should talk to him.

623
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,370
Tell him how proud I am?

624
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,340
Hey, if you're ashamed of him,
tell him that.

625
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:51,110
Pride and shame only apply
to people we have a vested
interest in, not employees.

626
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,280
How many hours a day
do you have to spend
with someone

627
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,750
before they're
basically family?

628
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,950
Good point.

629
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,320
But, first, I've got to tell
Cameron and Chase that
they're violating God's will.

630
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,390
I'm just asking you to have
an adult conversation
to let him know...

631
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,990
That he did a good job?
He knows it.

632
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:11,100
Adults don't need adult
conversations, just like I
don't need this conversation.

633
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,170
Have you killed Hector yet?

634
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,500
Obviously not.

635
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,340
Oh. He's quiet. He's...

636
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,270
Is that my stethoscope?

637
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,010
Bad dog.

638
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,950
Listen...

639
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,890
Bonnie joined her homeowner's
association and staged a coup.

640
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,090
Pets are now allowed.

641
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,420
Oh.

642
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,090
If you want to keep him,

643
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,830
she wants a new puppy anyway.
She'll understand.

644
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,840
Why would I want to keep him?

645
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,600
You're sure?

646
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,240
Come on, boy.

647
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,850
Accidents happen.

648
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,360
Candy?

649
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,400
Good boy.

650
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,320
Good boy.

651
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,870
You did good.

652
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,170
I did what you would have.

653
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,120
Well, maybe I'm biased, but...

654
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,350
I tortured the kid.

655
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,680
Because you knew it was right.

656
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,950
You knew you were
saving his brother.

657
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,560
I know.

658
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,820
I don't like that I know.

659
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,900
I hate that I can listen
to a kid screaming in pain

660
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,930
and not even take a moment
to question whether I'm
doing the right thing.

661
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,830
I hate that in order
to be like you, as a doctor,

662
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,710
I have to be like you
as a human being.

663
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,610
I don't want to turn into you.

664
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,180
You're not.

665
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,820
You've been like me
since you were
eight-years-old.

666
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,930
You'll save more people
