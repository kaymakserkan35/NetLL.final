1
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:03,901
Sam: You think Adam's okay?

2
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:05,201
Adam: No! No!

3
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:06,101
Dean!

4
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:07,735
Dean: Doubt it.

5
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:11,172
Cass either.

6
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:13,108
[grunts]

7
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:16,477
[all screaming]

8
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:18,379
<i>The cage you sprung</i>
<i>Lucifer from...</i>

9
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:20,281
<i>you can shove his ass back in.</i>

10
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:22,550
<i>The key to the cage...</i>
<i>four rings from The Horsemen.</i>

11
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:25,620
Dean: Well, we got War's.
We nicked Famine's.

12
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:27,055
That's two rings down.

13
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,123
Collect all four.

14
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:29,524
Crowley: I can give you Pestilence.

15
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:31,059
Do you want The
Horsemen ring's or not?

16
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:32,293
What are we dealing with?
Do you know?

17
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:35,496
Sam: Croatoan. It's a virus of
Plague and Pestilence.

18
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,798
More like demonic germ warfare.

19
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,566
They want our vaccine.

20
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,936
They <i>need</i> our vaccine.

21
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,805
It's called "demand,"
people. Now, supply!

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,540
Sir, great news.

23
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:48,576
The vaccine trials...
the results have been...

24
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,178
[chuckles]
really quite grotesque.

25
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:51,546
I think you'll be pleased.

26
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:56,184
Oh, hello, Death.

27
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:57,318
You make a wish.

28
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:58,820
I can give you
anything you want, mate.

29
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:01,857
Up to and including
Death's coordinates.

30
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,158
All I need is...

31
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:04,760
Bobby: My soul.

32
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:06,962
Say we can open the cage.

33
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:08,329
But then what?

34
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:10,665
What if <i>you</i> guys
lead the devil to the edge

35
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:12,200
and <i>I</i> jump in?

36
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:21,642
Dr. Green,
how was your trip?

37
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:24,179
Oh, very productive.

38
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:29,717
And how are we tonight,
Celeste, my favorite patient?

39
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:32,087
The nurse says you can't sleep.

40
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:35,556
Oh, I just feel
worse and worse.

41
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:39,060
Well, that's because you're
suffering from a combination

42
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:40,295
of the common cold...

43
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,097
Dengue fever...

44
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:45,867
and a nasty, nasty case
of Japanese encephalitis.

45
00:01:45,902 --> 00:01:47,936
What are you...

46
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,105
[chuckling]
I'm sorry. I...

47
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:52,207
Oh, you heard me.

48
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:58,613
Oh, and look at that.

49
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:00,816
You never had
chicken-pox as a child.

50
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,753
Oh, <i>this</i> is gonna be fascinating.

51
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:07,723
[weakly] But I...
h-how could I...

52
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:09,925
Have all those diseases at once?

53
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,493
Well, it's a proprietary blend.

54
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:14,429
I mix it up in a petri dish.

55
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:17,398
The petri dish being... you.

56
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,400
[gasps]

57
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:22,503
Try and relax.
It'll be all right.

58
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:25,106
Are you... gonna c-cure me?

59
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,607
No.

60
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:28,309
You're going to die.

61
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,579
In four, three...
[coughing]

62
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:33,381
Two...
[gags]

63
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:37,485
Interesting.

64
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,595
  Season 5 Episode 21
"Two Minutes to Midnight"

65
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:48,964
Dean: What the hell
is wrong with you?

66
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:50,631
- Sam: Dean...
- Dean: No, don't "Dean" me.

67
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,334
I mean, you... you have had
some stupid ideas in the past,

68
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:55,470
but this...
Did you know about this?

69
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:57,505
- What.
- About Sam's genius plan

70
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:59,340
to say yes to the Devil?

71
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,379
Well, thanks for the heads up!

72
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:05,613
Hey, this ain't
about <i>me.</i>

73
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:06,614
You can't do this.

74
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,016
That's the consensus.

75
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,018
All right. Awesome.
Then, end of discussion.

76
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:11,619
[cellphone rings] [sighs]

77
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:13,588
This isn't over.

78
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:16,825
Hello?

79
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:18,626
- Dean?
- Cass?

80
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,295
Is he okay?

81
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:24,165
We all thought you were Dead.
Where the hell are you, man?

82
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,233
A hospital.

83
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:26,467
Are you okay?

84
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:27,703
No.

85
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,506
You want to elaborate?

86
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,674
I just woke up here.

87
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,211
The doctors
were fairly surprised.

88
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:38,546
They thought
I was brain-dead.

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,916
S-so, a hospital?

90
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,584
Apparently, after Van Nuys...

91
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:46,621
I suddenly appeared,
bloody and unconscious,

92
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:49,057
on a shrimping boat
off Delacroix.

93
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,092
I'm told it upset the sailors.

94
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:53,394
Uh, well, I got
to tell you, man...

95
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:54,695
you're just in time.

96
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,232
We figured out a way
to pop Satan's box.

97
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:58,433
[weakly] How?

98
00:03:58,467 --> 00:03:59,735
It's a long story, but, look...
[grunts]

99
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,602
We're going after Pestilence now.

100
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,538
So if you want to
zap over here...

101
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:05,606
I can't "zap" anywhere.

102
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:07,242
What do you mean?

103
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:10,011
You could say my batteries
are... are drained.

104
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,913
What do you mean,
you're out of angel mojo?

105
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:14,950
I'm saying that I am thirsty
and my head aches.

106
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:17,953
I have a bug bite that itches no
matter how much I scratch it,

107
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:20,088
and I'm saying
that I'm just incredibly...

108
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:21,089
[chuckles]

109
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,623
Human.

110
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:24,559
[sighs]

111
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,561
Wow.

112
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:27,763
Sorry.

113
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:30,098
Well, my point is... I can't
go anywhere without money

114
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:33,902
for... an airplane ride.

115
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:35,771
And food.

116
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:37,773
And more pain medication, ideally.

117
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:38,807
All right.

118
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:39,908
Well, look, no worries.

119
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:42,143
Uh, Bobby's here.
He'll wire you the cash.

120
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:43,979
- Dean, wait.
- Bobby: I will?

121
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:46,447
You said "no" to Michael.

122
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:48,583
I owe you an apology.

123
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:49,584
Cass...

124
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:51,219
I-it's okay.

125
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:53,654
You are not the burnt
and broken shell of a man

126
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,223
that I believed you to be.

127
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:58,493
Thank you.

128
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,429
I appreciate that.

129
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:03,364
You're welcome.

130
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,133
[receiver clicks]

131
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,972
Be careful.
[engine turns over]

132
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,284
So this is
Dr. Evil's lair, huh?

133
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,691
[sighs]

134
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:32,894
It's kind of more
depressing than evil.

135
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:35,263
It's like a four-color
brochure for dying young.

136
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:38,333
Of course, to Pestilence, it's
probably dolly-wood in there.

137
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,534
[scoffs] Great.

138
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:41,502
A whole building
full of people.

139
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:43,171
We don't know who's human,

140
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,006
who's demon,
and who's Pestilence.

141
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,878
So what do we do?

142
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:52,147
Hang on.

143
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,957
[door opens]

144
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,392
Hey. Hi.
Uh, I'm looking for my Nana.

145
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:06,527
Uh, her name is Eunice Kennedy.

146
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:08,596
Go around front
and see the nurse.

147
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:11,066
You mind just
helping me out, sir?

148
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,469
Uh, she's about, uh,
about that small

149
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,204
and gray hair, wears diapers.

150
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,979
Dean: [grunts]

151
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:26,514
Eunice Kennedy?

152
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:29,017
That's the beauty
about improv, Sammy.

153
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:31,186
You never know what's gonna
come out of your mouth.

154
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,821
[both chuckle]

155
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:42,698
So, what are...

156
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:43,899
Hey.

157
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,266
What are we even looking for?

158
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:48,937
Well, he's Pestilence,
so he probably looks sick.

159
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,238
<i>Everybody</i> looks sick.

160
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,309
[groans]

161
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,453
Hey.

162
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:17,899
Oh, now we're talking.

163
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:27,042
Dr. Green,
how was your trip?

164
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:29,410
Oh, very productive.

165
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:34,950
And how are we tonight,
Celeste, my favorite patient?

166
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:44,325
[elevator bell dings]

167
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,910
Nurse: Sir...

168
00:08:03,445 --> 00:08:06,281
the Winchesters are here.

169
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:07,682
We should go.

170
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:09,885
[chuckles]

171
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,855
Are you kidding me?

172
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,759
They have a track
record with Horsemen.

173
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:20,628
You mean my brothers.

174
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:22,898
What they did to my brothers.

175
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,933
No.

176
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:29,004
The only reasonable thing
to do here is to...

177
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:31,506
take it out of their
healthy young asses.

178
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,643
We're under strict orders
not to kill the vessels.

179
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:36,978
Oh, if Satan wants them so bad,

180
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:39,447
he can glue them back together!

181
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,860
Come. Come.

182
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:09,477
Now then.

183
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,900
- Page me if she's dying.
- Yes, Doctor.

184
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,615
[coughing, gagging]

185
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:22,523

186
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:29,497
[wind howling]

[both coughing, gagging]

190
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:57,225
Ugh...

191
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:59,294
Must be getting close.

192
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:02,097
You think?

193
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:16,845
Dean?

194
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,082
[coughing] Get up.

195
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:36,965
The doctor will see you now.

196
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:41,336
Sam.

197
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,371
Dean.

198
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:48,810
Come right in.

199
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:54,117
[coughing]

200
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,221
[coughing, gasping]

201
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,222
Hmm.

202
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:01,024
You boys don't look well.

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,662
It might be
the, uh, Scarlet fever.

204
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:07,831
Or, uh, the meningitis.

205
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,433
Oh!
[chuckles]

206
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,669
Or the syphilis.

207
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:15,338
[clicks tongue]

209
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:18,141
That's no fun.

210
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,713
[grunts]

211
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,381
However you feel right now?

212
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:30,353
It's gonna get so
very, very much worse.

213
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:31,755
Questions?

214
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,123
[grunts]

215
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:38,361
Disease gets a bad rap,
don't you think?

216
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:41,397
For being filthy, chaotic.

217
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:45,068
Uh, but, really, t-that just
describes <i>people</i> who get sick.

218
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:47,070
Disease itself...

219
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:50,039
very... pure...

220
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:52,208
single-minded.

221
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:57,280
Bacteria have one purpose...
divide and conquer.

222
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:58,614
[bones crunching]

223
00:11:58,648 --> 00:12:00,116
[grunting]

224
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,585
That's why, in the end...

225
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,954
it always wins.

226
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:08,592
[sighs]

227
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:12,395
So, you've got to wonder
why God pours all his love

228
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,030
into something so <i>messy...</i>

229
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:16,966
and <i>weak.</i>

230
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:18,668
[groans]

231
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:21,404
It's ridiculous.

232
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:25,909
All I can do is
show him he's wrong.

233
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:28,945
One epidemic at a time.

234
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,780
Now...

235
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:33,984
on a scale of 1 to 10,
how's your pain?

236
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:37,854
Dean: Cass.

237
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:39,355
How'd you get here?

238
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,791
I took a bus.
Don't worry, I...

239
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,259
[coughing, gagging]

240
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:51,434
Well, look at that.

241
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:55,304
An occupied vessel, but powerless.

242
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:59,475
Oh, that's fascinating.

243
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:04,613
There's not a speck of
angel in you, is there?

244
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,616
Oh!

245
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:08,818
Maybe just a speck.

246
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,219
[screaming]

247
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:11,855

[moaning]

250
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:21,197
It doesn't matter.

251
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:23,332
It's too late.

252
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,475
[sighs]

253
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,181
Well, it's nice to
actually score a home run

254
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:40,016
for once, ain't it?

255
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,054
What?

256
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,489
Last thing Pestilence said.

257
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:49,025
"It's too late."

258
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,360
He get specific?

259
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,829
No.

260
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,330
We're just a little freaked out

261
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,365
that he might have
left a bomb somewhere.

262
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,368
So please tell us
you have actual good news.

263
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:03,339
Chicago's about
to be wiped off the map.

264
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:06,275
Storm of the millennium.

265
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,078
Sets off a daisy chain
of natural disasters.

266
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,380
Three million people
are gonna die.

267
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:14,083
Huh.

268
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:17,586
I don't understand
your definition of good news.

269
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,588
Well...

270
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:23,559
Death, The Horsemen...
he's gonna be there.

271
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:27,697
And if we can stop him before
he kick-starts this storm,

272
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:28,998
get his ring back...

273
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,600
Yeah, you make
it sound so easy.

274
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:33,269
Hell, I'm just trying to
put a spin on it.

275
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:36,205
Well...

276
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,709
Bobby, h-how'd you put
all this together, anyways?

277
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:43,546
I had, you know... help.

278
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,882
[glass clinks]

279
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:48,952
Don't be so modest.

280
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,587
I barely helped at all.

281
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,559
Hello, boys.

282
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:59,295
Pleasure, et cetera.

283
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,265
[sniffs]

284
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,770
Go ahead. Tell them.

285
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:08,104
There's no shame in it.

286
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:11,274
Bobby?

287
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:12,976
Tell us what?

288
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:19,582
World's gonna end.

289
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:23,486
Seems stupid to get all precious
over one little... soul.

290
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,154
You sold your soul?

291
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:27,657
Oh, more like pawned it.
I fully intend to give it back.

292
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:28,758
Well, then give it back!

293
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:30,093
- I will.
- Now!

294
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:31,260
- Did you kiss him?
- Sam!

295
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:32,461
Just wondering.

296
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,467
No!

297
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:42,171
[clears throat]

298
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,279
Why'd you take a picture?

299
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:52,816
Why do you have to use tongue?

300
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:59,889
All right. You know what?
I'm sick of this.

301
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,991
Give him his soul back <i>now.</i>

302
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:05,161
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- Can't or won't?

303
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:07,296
I won't, all right?
It's insurance.

304
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:09,666
- What are you talking about?
- You kill demons.

305
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,302
Gigantor over there
has a temper issue about it.

306
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:15,171
But you won't kill me...

307
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:19,375
as long as I have that soul
in the deposit box.

308
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,444
You son of a bitch.

309
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:24,047
I'll return it.

310
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,483
After all this is over,
and I can walk safely away.

311
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:30,687
Do we all
understand each other?

312
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,033
[sighs]

313
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:52,876
Let me guess.
We're about to have a talk.

314
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,079
[chuckles]

315
00:16:56,113 --> 00:17:00,116
Look, Dean, um...
[clears throat]

316
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,385
for the record...

317
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:03,887
I agree with you

318
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,554
about <i>me.</i>

319
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:11,360
You think I'm too weak
to take on Lucifer.

320
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:13,062
Well, so do I.

321
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:14,631
[chuckles]

322
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:19,803
Believe me, I know exactly
how screwed up I am.

323
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:23,106
You, Bobby, Cass...

324
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,108
I'm the least of any of you.

325
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:27,076
- Oh, Sam...
- No, it's true. It is.

326
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,412
But...

327
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:31,815
I'm also all we got.

328
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,983
If there was another way...

329
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,752
[train whistle blows]

330
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:37,086
but I don't think there is.

331
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:38,321
There's just me.

332
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:42,325
So I don't know
what else to do.

333
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,797
Except just try to do
what's got to be done.

There's something
you need to see.

Niveus pharmaceuticals
is rushing delivery

338
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:09,418
of its new swine-flu vaccine,

339
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:13,122
to quote, "stem the tide of
the unprecedented outbreak."

340
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:16,092
Uh, shipments leave Wednesday.

341
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:17,460
Niveus pharmaceuticals.

342
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:19,128
Get it?

you have your looks.

V.P. of distribution... Niveus.

347
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:36,345
Ah, yes, that the sound
of the abacus clacking?

348
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,181
We all caught up?

349
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:40,850
So, Pestilence was
spreading swine flu.

350
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,285
Yeah, but not just for giggles.

351
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,220
That was step one.
Step two is the vaccine.

352
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:45,855
- And you think...
- I <i>know.</i>

353
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,490
I'll stake my reputation...

354
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:49,626
That vaccine is chock-full
of grade-A,

356

Simultaneous, countrywide distribution.

357
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:59,135
It's quite a plan.

They don't get to be
Horsemen for nothing.

359
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,909
So, you boys
better stock up on...

360
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,911
well, everything.

361
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,913
This time next Thursday...

362
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:11,781
we'll all be living
in zombie-land.

# oh, death #

367
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,606
# oh, death #

368
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:43,112
# won't you spare me over
another year? #

369
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,682
[rhythmic humming]

370
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:54,057
# but what is this
that I can't see #

371
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:58,561
# with ice-cold hands
taking hold of me? #

372
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,664
[rhythmic humming]

373
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:04,933
Watch where
you're walking, pal.

374
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:10,639
# when God is gone
and the devil takes hold #

375
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:14,143
# who will have mercy
on your soul? #

376
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:16,980
# oh, death #

377
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:20,116
# oh, death #

# my name is death,
and the end is here #

380
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:48,760
What's <i>your</i> problem?

381
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:52,631
This is what they mean
by "the 11th hour," right?

382
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,366
Pretty much.

383
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,668
Well, it's the 11th hour,
and I am useless.

384
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,839
All I have is this.

385
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:02,541
What am I even
supposed to do with it?

386
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,108
Point it and shoot.

387
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,679
What I used to be...

388
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:10,081
Are you really gonna
bitch... to <i>me?</i>

389
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:18,490
Quit pining
for the varsity years...

390
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:21,993
and load the damn truck.

391
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:31,536
Dean: All right, well...

392
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:34,506
good luck stopping
the whole zombie apocalypse.

393
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,307
Sam: Yeah.

394
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:37,842
Good luck killing Death.

395
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:40,044
Yeah.

396
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:43,515
[chuckles]

397
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,386
Remember when we used to just...
hunt Wendigos?

398
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,721
How simple things were?

399
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,155
Not really.

400
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:56,027
Well, um...

401
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:00,565
you might need this.

402
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:04,403
Keep it.
Dean's covered.

403
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:08,006
Death's own.

404
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,943
Kills, golly, demons
and angels and reapers

405
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:15,347
and... rumor has it,
the very thing itself.

406
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,718
How did you get that?

407
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:22,421
Hello... king of the crossroads.

408
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:25,256
So, shall we?

409
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,726
Bobby, you just
gonna sit there?

410
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,761
No, I'm gonna river-dance.

411
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:32,531
I suppose if you want
to impress the ladies.

412
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:38,770
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

413
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:41,373
Really wasted that crossroads deal.

414
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:46,210
Fact... you get more if
you phrase it properly.

415
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,146
So, I took the
liberty of adding

416
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,583
a teeny little sub-a-clause
on your behalf.

417
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:57,389
What can I say?

418
00:22:57,423 --> 00:22:58,890
I'm an altruist.

419
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:02,961
Just gonna sit there?

420
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:23,948
[breathes heavily]

421
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:29,788
Son of a bitch.

422
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:32,190
Yes, I know.
Completely worth your soul.

423
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:34,326
I'm a hell of a guy.

424
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,262
Thanks.

425
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:41,099
This is getting maudlin.

426
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:42,834
Can we go?

427
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:45,937
[car door opens]

428
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:47,639
[car door closes]

429
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,815
"Yes" to Lucifer,

430
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,383
then jump in the hole.

431
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:00,919
It's an interesting plan.

432
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,754
[scoffs]
That's a word for it.

433
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:04,022
Sam: So?

434
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:06,391
Go ahead and tell me it's
the worst plan you ever heard.

435
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:07,726
Of course.

436
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,662
I am happy to say that
if that's what you want to hear.

437
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:12,063
But it's not what I think.

438
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:14,433
Really?

439
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:19,504
You and Dean have a habit
of exceeding my expectations.

440
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,740
He resisted Michael,

441
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,642
maybe you <i>could</i>
<i>resist Lucifer</i>

442
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:26,578
But there are things
that you would need to know.

443
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:28,312
Like?

444
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:29,981
Michael has found
another vessel.

445
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,916
What?

446
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:34,486
It 's your brother, Adam.

447
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,154
You must have considered it.

448
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:38,357
We were trying not to.

449
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:45,530
Sam...

450
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:49,668
if you say yes to Lucifer
and then fail...

451
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:53,337
This fight will happen.

452
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:55,540
And the collateral...

453
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:58,410
it'll be immense.

454
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:02,747
There's also the demon blood.

455
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:04,549
What? What are you
talking about?

456
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:07,351
To take in Lucifer, it would be
more than you've ever drunk.

457
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,755
But... why?

458
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,190
It strengthens the vessel.

459
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:13,558
Keeps it from exploding.

460
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:14,793
But the guy he's in now...

461
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:15,994
is drinking gallons.

462
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:20,899
And <i>how</i> is that not
the worst plan you ever heard?

463
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:28,507
[reverse alarm beeping]

464
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:35,614
Yup, they're loading up hotshots
of Croatoan in the trucks.

465
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:38,750
Okay. First truck
don't leave for an hour.

466
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,886
We get in,
we plant the C-4 every 25 feet,

467
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:43,054
then we pull the fire alarm.

468
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,389
That truck is leaving.

469
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,727
Balls!

470
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:50,962
Okay, new plan.

471
00:25:58,203 --> 00:25:59,371

[electricity crackles]

474
00:26:11,484 --> 00:26:12,684
It's the Winchesters.

475
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:14,953
Well, then, let's bake
them up a little treat.

476
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:25,630
- Woman: Help!
- Side door!

[knocking, banging]

478
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:28,767
- Get back.
- Help me, please!

479
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:31,002
Get back!

480

[gunshot]

481
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:34,138
Go. Come on. Go.

Woman: Help me! Please, help!

486
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:21,243
There's still people here.

487
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:23,078
Sam, no!

488
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:25,480
Wait here.

489
00:27:25,514 --> 00:27:26,849
Damn.

490
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:43,666
Hey, let's stop for pizza.

491
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,900
Are you kidding?

492
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:47,535
Just heard it
was good, that's all.

493
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:50,405
Up ahead.
Big, ugly building.

494
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,707
Ground zero.

495
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:53,976
Horseman's stable, if you will.

496
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,077
He's in there.

497
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,712
How do you know?

498
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:58,280
Have you met me?

499
00:27:58,314 --> 00:27:59,715
'Cause I <i>know.</i>

500
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:03,586
Also, the block is
squirming with reapers.

501
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:10,425
I'll be right back.

502
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:18,300
Boy, is my face red.

503
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,035
Death's not in there.

504
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:21,269
You want to cut the cute

505
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,305
and get to the part
where you tell me where he is?

506
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,974
Sorry. I don't know.

507
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

508
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:29,311
You don't know?

509
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:33,281
Signs pointed.
I-I'm just as shocked as you.

510
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:35,450
Bobby sold his soul for this!

511
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:36,952
Relax.

512
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:39,321
All deals are soul back
or store credit.

513
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:41,389
We'll catch Death
in the next doomed city.

514
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:42,557
Millions, Crowley.

515
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:44,827
Millions of people
are about to die any minute.

516
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:46,028
True.

517
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:48,997
So I strongly suggest
we get out of here.

am I supposed to get

three million people out of
Chicago in the next 10 minutes?

531
00:29:42,952 --> 00:29:45,487
Come on!

532
00:29:57,801 --> 00:30:00,836
What?
I can't hear you!

533
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,971
I said I found him.

534
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:04,973
Death...
he's in there.

535
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:15,851
You coming or...

536
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:20,823
not.

Go! Go!

Actually,
these things <i>can</i> be useful.

544
00:30:49,686 --> 00:30:54,156
Can we commit our act
of domestic terrorism already?

545
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,924
Let's go.

546
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:54,783
Thanks for returning that.

547
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:02,124
Join me, Dean.

548
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:04,827
The pizza's delicious.

549
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,649
Sit down.

550
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:34,690
Took you long enough
to find me.

551
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:37,525
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

552
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:40,428
I got to say...

553
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:42,865
I have mixed feelings about that.

554
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:47,302
S-so is this the part where...
[clears throat]

555
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:49,371
where you kill me?

556
00:32:56,145 --> 00:33:00,082
You have an inflated sense
of your importance.

557
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:03,986
To a thing like me,
a thing like you, well...

558
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,320
[slurps]

559
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:10,793
think how you'd feel
if a bacterium sat at your table

560
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:13,528
and started to get snarky.

561
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:19,367
This is one little planet
in one tiny solar system

562
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:23,305
in a galaxy that's barely
out of its diapers.

563
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:25,974
I'm old, Dean.

564
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,943
Very old.

565
00:33:27,977 --> 00:33:30,746
So I invite you to contemplate

566
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,248
how insignificant I find you.

567
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:35,217
[thunder crashes]

568
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:37,886
Eat.

569
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,984
Good, isn't it?

570
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:18,326
Well, I got to ask.

571
00:34:19,328 --> 00:34:20,796
How old are you?

572
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,065
As old as God.

573
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,100
Maybe older.

574
00:34:25,134 --> 00:34:28,403
Neither of us
can remember anymore.

575
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:31,039
Life, death, chicken, egg.

576
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:35,377
Regardless... at the end,
I'll reap him, too.

577
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:38,146
God?

578
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:39,815
You'll reap God?

579
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:41,183
Oh, yes.

580
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:44,186
God will die too, Dean.

581
00:34:51,194 --> 00:34:53,662
Well, this is way
above my pay grade.

582
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:55,297
Just a bit.

583
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:00,502
So, then why
am I still breathing...

584
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:01,904
sitting here with you?

585
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:04,206
Uh... w-what do you want?

586
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,541
The leash around my neck... off.

587
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,312
Lucifer has me bound to him.

588
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:13,181
Some unseemly little spell.

589
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:16,852
He has me where he wants,
when he wants.

590
00:35:16,886 --> 00:35:19,187
That's why I couldn't go to <i>you.</i>

591
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:22,557
I had to wait
for <i>you</i> to catch up.

592
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,594
He made me his weapon.

593
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,565
Hurricanes, floods,
raising the dead.

594
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,735
I'm more powerful
than you can process,

595
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:37,505
and I'm enslaved to a bratty
child having a tantrum.

596
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,175
And you think...

597
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:41,777
<i>I</i> can unbind you?

598
00:35:41,811 --> 00:35:43,746
There's your ridiculous
bravado again.

599
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,714
Of course you can't.

600
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:46,949
But you can help me

601
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:49,417
take the bullets
out of Lucifer's gun.

602
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:57,092
I understand you want this.

603
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:00,963
Yeah.

604
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:02,598
I'm inclined to give it to you.

605
00:36:02,632 --> 00:36:04,567
To give it to me?

606
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:05,768
That's what I said.

607
00:36:07,837 --> 00:36:11,473
But what about... Chicago?

608
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:13,208
[thunder crashes]

609
00:36:14,844 --> 00:36:17,512
I suppose it can stay.

610
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:19,748
I like the pizza.

611
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:28,724
There are conditions.

612
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:31,760
Okay. Like?

613
00:36:32,862 --> 00:36:34,763
You have to do
whatever it takes

614
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:37,299
to put Lucifer in his cell.

615
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:39,467
Of course.

616
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:40,936
<i>Whatever</i> it takes.

617
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,738
That's the plan.

618
00:36:42,772 --> 00:36:43,972
No. No plan. Not yet.

619
00:36:45,642 --> 00:36:46,775
Your brother.

620
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,777
He's the one
that can stop Lucifer.

621
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:50,412
The <i>only</i> one.

622
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:53,682
What, you think...

623
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,250
I know.

624
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:58,020
So, I need a promise.

625
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:00,022
You're going to
let your brother

626
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:03,258
jump right into that fiery pit.

627
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:13,568
Well, do I have your word?

628
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:22,945
Okay, yeah.
Yes.

629
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,951
That had better be "yes," Dean.

630
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:31,820
You know you can't cheat Death.

631
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:36,725
[thunder stops]

632
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,629
Now, would you like
the instruction manual?

633
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:03,388
[crackling]

634
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:13,565
Well, how'd it go
at the Rockettes audition?

635
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,234
Well, high kicks... fair.

636
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:17,369
Boobs need work.

637
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,839
I walked up and down stairs
all night for no damn reason.

638
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,776
[laughing] I'm sore.

639
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,347
Feels so good,
I'm scared it's a dream.

640
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:32,850
But then I remember that
the world's dying bloody...

641
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:34,987
so, drink?

642
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,991
[bottle opens]

643
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,659
Check it out.

644
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:46,631
[crackles]

645
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:48,433
Hmm.

646
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,039
Oh.

647
00:38:54,073 --> 00:38:56,408
So Death told you
how to operate those?

648
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:58,043
The whole deal?

649
00:38:58,077 --> 00:38:59,744
Yeah. It's nuts.

650
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:02,680
Of course,
I got bigger problems now.

651
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,149
Really? Like?

652
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:05,450
[smacks lips]

653
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:07,752
What do you think Death does
to people who lie to his face?

654
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:10,922
- Nothing good.
- Yeah.

655
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:12,489
What'd you say?

656
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:16,894
That I was cool with Sam
driving the bus

657
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,463
on the whole Lucifer plan.

658
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,335
So death thinks Sam
ought to say yes, huh?

659
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,337
I don't know. Yeah.

660
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:27,505
Hmm.

661
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,007
But, I mean...
of course he'd say that.

662
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,508
He <i>works</i> for Lucifer.

663
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:32,744
Against his will,
I thought he said.

664
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:35,647
Well, I'd say, take his sob
story with a fat grain of salt.

665
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:36,882
I mean, he is Death.

666
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,251
Exactly, he's Death.

667
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:41,887
Think of the kind of
bird's-eye view.

668
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,721
Seriously?

669
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,123
- I'm just saying...
- Well, don't.

670
00:39:45,158 --> 00:39:47,125
I mean, what happened
to you being against this?

671
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,626
Look, I'm not saying Sam

672
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:50,728
ain't an ass-full
of character defects.

673
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,130
- But...
- But what?

674
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:54,798
[sighs]

675
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:56,300
Back at Niveus...

676
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:59,604
I watched that kid pull
one civilian out after another.

677
00:39:59,672 --> 00:40:01,839
He must have saved 10 people.

678
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:04,309
Never stopped.
Never slowed down.

679
00:40:04,343 --> 00:40:06,344
We're hard on him, Dean.

680
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:07,946
We've always been.

681
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,449
But in the meantime...

682
00:40:11,484 --> 00:40:13,952
he's been running
into burning buildings

683
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:15,453
since he was... what, 12?

684
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:17,355
Pretty much.

685
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,125
Look, Sam's got a...

686
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,793
darkness in him.

687
00:40:21,827 --> 00:40:23,962
I'm not saying he don't.

688
00:40:23,997 --> 00:40:27,132
But he's got a hell of a lot
of good in him, too.

689
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:31,603
I know.

690
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,273
Then you <i>know</i>
<i>Sam will beat the devil...</i>

691
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,975
or die trying.

692
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:41,679
That's the best
we could ask for.

693
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,818
So I got to ask, Dean.

694
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:49,821
What exactly are you afraid of?

695
00:40:51,524 --> 00:40:53,158
Losing?

696
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:55,560
Or losing your brother?

697
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,960
