1
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,970
So there I am, on my
25th birthday, driving from
Wheeling, West Virginia,

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,238
to Bensonhurst,
in a Dodge Dart with no radio

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,711
and a gunrunner
named Barrelhead,

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,848
who insisted we sing
every Jimmy Buffett song
he could recall.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,851
What could I say?
The man was heavily armed.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,550
So, 500 renditions of
Margaritaville Iater...
My first cover.

7
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,185
Eight thousand words on
how Barrelhead and his friends
were transporting handguns

8
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,253
for sale to New York City.

9
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,425
The day the magazine
hit the stands,
the DA hit me with a subpoena.

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,901
He wanted to know
Barrelhead's real name.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,201
And Greta had been
managing editor
for three whole days.

12
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,774
So she invited me
across the street
to the fancy bar

13
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,174
where they use real glasses.

14
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,312
And after about
the sixth vodka and tonic,

15
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,509
she said, "FIetch,
I want you to know
the magazine is behind you."

16
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,347
Well, I was impressed.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,320
I said, "You think you can get
the DA off my back?"

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,825
And she said, "No, but when
you get out of jail,
you'II still have a job."

19
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:06,128
I'm 45. I've given up a Iot.
I've given up the road,
that Iife...

20
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,935
Thanks, EIizabeth. No regrets.
My Iovely wife.

21
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,870
I've given up drinking.
I've given up drugs.

22
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,332
Greta taught me there's
two things you never give up.

23
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,844
One's rock and roll.
The other's a source.

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,775

WOMAN: We'II miss you, Greta.

to the Iack of stress
in your...

I flung the investment.

What's the best

00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,188
We are.

00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,388
Yeah. "We" aren't here.

Iying to Medicaid
about his billings.

So? I'm board certified.

51

You are not House.

52
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,630
Why'd you put me in charge of
the department if you think
I can't handle it?

53
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,073
Because it's temporary,
and because I was ordered to.

54
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,970
What are the symptoms?

55
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,411
Oh, come on.

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,909
You're gonna diagnose him
without meeting him?

57
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,713
Prove that you're
as brilliant as House?

58
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,946
I need to know the symptoms
to know which hospital
to recommend.

struck his head and
is suffering from aphasia.

A neurological problem.

You know, I know a Iot of
good people in that field,

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,232
seeing as I happen to be
a neurologist.

77
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,108
He used to drink regularly,

78
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,013
but he's been clean and sober
for nearly a year.

79
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,642
Mr. Stone, you think
you're speaking normally,

80
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,846
but your speech is impaired.

81
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,015
He knows what he wants to say,
but when he
reaches for a word,

82
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,581
he finds something else.

83

He doesn't know
that he's saying it wrong?

86
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,427
It all sounds right to him.

I want you to write your name
and draw a face.

00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,621

How hard did he
hit his head?

91
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,628
It was
a pretty good crack.

92
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,826
It made
a really ugly sound.

what I'm saying?
Of golf.

94

are there?

He didn't trip. He just fell.
Out of the blue.

103
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:07,622
His foot jerked a Iittle bit,
first. That's what made it
Iook Iike a trip.

If I thought you were capable
of Iistening, I'd shut up.

109

no sense at all.

AII right. Patient...

118
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,123
If he didn't trip,
something made him fall.
Stroke, seizure?

119
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,094
Thirty people saw him trip.
One person says he didn't.

120
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,187
Who are we
gonna believe?

121
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,289
His symptoms can all be
explained by the head trauma.

122
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,392
It causes
a contusion or a seizure.
That causes the aphasia.

123
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,561
We should get an EEG.

124
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,332
If it was a stroke,
could be a clotting issue.

125
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:23,205
Even if he fell,
drug use is far more Iikely.
I'm ordering a tox screen.

with the differential.

You're not my boss.

128
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,906
I'm House's boss.
House is your boss.
The math is pretty simple.

129
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,144
Are you signing my paychecks?
Are you hiring and firing?

130
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,449
This is not about that.

131
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,956
The only thing
you've been asked to do
is supervise House,

132
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,890
in case
he does something insane.

133
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,451
Which might,
you know, save a Iife.

134
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,591
Somebody's gotta be in charge.
Why?

135
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,157
What, do you think
we should all just do
whatever we wanna do?

136
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,634
Maybe have a race
to the diagnosis.

137
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,797
I think it should be
a discussion among peers.

138
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,272
I think we're grown-up enough
to reach a consensus.

139
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,512
Patient, 62 years old.
You prescribed Viagra.

140
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,115
I Iook in vain for the words
"erectile dysfunction"

141
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,679
in the notes
for Dolores Smith.

142
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,449
She had a heart condition.

143
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,290
And you
ran out of nitroglycerin?

144
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,423
She also had
Iow blood pressure,
so nitro would be dangerous.

145
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,735
The Iittle blue pills
improve blood flow.
They're vasodilators.

146
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,995
That's why
you sometimes get headaches.

147
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,802
I think
Dr. House understands...

148
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,503
Of course I do. The woman
has a heart condition,
she's on her own.

149
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,570
A man can't nail
his office assistant,
it's national crisis time.

150
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,649
Are you seriously expecting us
to foot the bill for
off-Iabel use of medication?

151
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,653
Fine. I'II pay for it.

152
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,718
How much are the pills?
She took how many?

153
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,652
Put the money away.

154
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,058
Are you trying to bribe me?
No.

155
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,296
I could.
There's an ATM in the Iobby.

156
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,162
My client's an idiot.

157
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,999
But is he wrong
about the pills?

158
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,273
Off-Iabel use
is not sanctioned...

159
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,467
You're retiring
in three weeks.

160
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,443
You've been doing this job
nearly 20 years.

161
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,208
Aren't you tired
of administering policy
that you disagree with?

162
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,848
I never said I disagree...
What can they do to you?

163
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,249
And Dr. House is sorry
about his earlier outburst.

164
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,288
Absolutely.

165
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,190
You do background
checks on Medicaid personnel?

166
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,894
I do what's necessary
for my client. Wow.
New personal record.

167
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,097
Yeah.
Timing's good for me, too.

168
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,369
Got a reservation
at a Iittle place
in the Inner Harbor.

169
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,807
You booked us
dinner reservations?

a background check on me?

175
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,625
You checked on my flight
so you could be sure
to be on a different one.

176
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,461
I thought we were
past the avoidance stage.

177
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,330
I didn't think
we'd be finished this soon.

180
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,203
Right.

This will show us
if there's a problem
with your carotid artery

182
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,347
that might cause a blood clot.

183
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,715
If it went to his brain,

184
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,756
it could explain the aphasia
and the falling down.

185
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,452
And you're giving him an EEG.
Is that for the same thing?

186
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,723
It's just a precaution.
I think the trauma
caused some swelling

187
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,095
and we need to keep him stable
until the body
can repair the damage.

188
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,997
And you think
they're both wrong?

And then there was one.
Urine test was positive
for amphetamines.

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,295
Amphetamines don't cause
pulmonary edema.

They do

the kids didn't call you.

I know
the way you tell stories.

225
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,190
Foreman went to talk to Stone
about his drug test, found him
running a temperature.

So it's not the drugs.

such a bad rep.

you shouldn't do that.

Encephalitis or meningitis
are the obvious suspects.

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,320
Start him on antibiotics.

234
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,591
It could be an autoimmune
disease. Lupus, Behcet's...

235
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,325
We could start him
on a high dose of steroids.

236
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,859
Except if he does have
encephalitis, steroids could
weaken his immune system.

broad-spectrum antibiotics for
possible bacterial meningitis,

244
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,918
and an antiviral in case
we Iuck out
and it's herpes encephalitis.

245
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,481
What if it's autoimmune?

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,223
Well, then we're screwed,

we need more information.

No.

00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,710
Have you been
out of the country
in the Iast five years?

264
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,911
Yes.

265
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,811

266
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,082
Yes.

267
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,690
Two years?

268
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,888
He stopped traveling for work
two years ago,
after we got serious.

269
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,558
Any vacations?

270
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,999
His Iast one
was six months ago.

271
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,993
This golf resort
at Key Biscayne.

272
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,164
No way
it was a golf resort.

273
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,503
Knowing FIetch, I assumed
he was working his way
through every bar in the Keys,

before settling down.

No.

00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,883
Amphetamines?

277
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,278
No.

278
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,216
You tested positive.

279
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,084
He doesn't use drugs.
I told you.

280
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,189
When we got engaged,
we decided we wanted
a different kind of Iife.

281
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,925
And he dropped
the macho journalism.
No more taking crazy chances.

282
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,361
That includes his health.

283
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,238
He asked me
not to tell EIizabeth.

284
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,139
So he's been Iying to her
about his drug habit?

285
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,074
Well, yes and no.

286
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,673
BE, before EIizabeth,
he used drugs recreationally.

287
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,378
I wasn't crazy about it,
but that thrill-seeking
behavior is what made him

288
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,182
the kind of journalist
that he was.

289
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,916
And now? AE?

290
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,292
Man's twisted himself
into knots for her.
Completely cleaned up his act.

291
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,627
But the drugs?
They're medicinal. Sort of.

292
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,933
He was having trouble
sleeping.

293
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,233
This new suburban Iifestyle.
Lack of excitement
was throwing him off.

294
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,404
So he started
with sleeping pills.

295
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,170
When they knocked him out,
he needed something
to perk him back up

296
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,767
during the day.

297
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,209
Every day?

298
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,749
No slippery slope there.

00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,716
Keep the stain!
Knife can't force.

300
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,289
We're not gonna tell
your wife. We're not cops.

301
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,908
There's a Iittle edema,
brain swelling,
and an area of scarring.

302
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,636
Is that
what's causing the aphasia?

303
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,343
Actually, that's what's odd.

304
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,180
The scarring's not
in the area of the brain
normally associated

305
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,618
with conduction aphasia.
And it's old.

306
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,018
Happened before
he hit his head.

307
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,819
Maybe a small stroke
or some other
underlying condition that

308
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:07,984
could be causing this.

309
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,052
Or it might have
nothing to do with it at all.

310
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,894
Have you ever had head trauma
before? An accident?

311
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,194
Ever had any numbness
on one side before? Dizziness?

312
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,167

313
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,232

So, what do you
want to talk about?

MS, toxins, any one
of 1 00 demyelinating diseases.

321

If it's meningitis,
we have to ID the bug fast.

What does House say?

325
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,831
"The person you are trying
to reach is out of the area or
has turned off their phone."

326
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,996
So, what are your orders?

327
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,166
We need more information.
There is no more information.

330
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,181
How's the patient?
Fine.

331
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,844
Where are you going?
FOREMAN: Dinner.

332
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,947
Oh, well, I'II join you,
and you can bring me
up to speed.

333
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,322
Oh, sorry.
Reservation for two.

334
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,557
When people
give themselves away,
it's by Iittle things.

335
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,699
That woman over there...
She's not sneering
at her coffee.

336
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,363
She's recovering
from Bell's palsy.

337
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,976
And the cashier
at the coffee place...

338
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,379
She doesn't want anyone to
know, but she's dying of ALS.

339
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:48,715
There's a particular
sort of twitchy, stiff arm
that's characteristic.

340
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,853
And then there's you.

341
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,985
Why aren't you
wearing your cross?

342
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,160
I told you
I Ieft it at...

343
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,962
You keep jewelry cleaner under
the sink so you won't have
to go a day without it.

344
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,401
True, you forgot it that
morning that our pipes burst,

345
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,398
but then you went back
and waded through the flood
to retrieve it.

346
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,137
So, why no wading today?

347
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,804
Didn't you bring a book
to read, or something?

348
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,051
Nothing.

349
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,225
Caffeine pills
and amphetamines.

350
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,923
Same stuff
he told us he was taking.

351
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,234
And Topamax.

352
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,234
An anticonvulsant?
But he said there was
no history of prior seizure.

353
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,899
It's not even
prescribed to him.

354
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,534
Still doesn't explain
his fever.

355
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,638
He's probably just using it
for weight Ioss.
Just gives us another Iie.

356
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,615
He must really be devoted.

357
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,911
Should we check the home?

358
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,577
If he wanted to hide something
from his wife,

359
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,211
why wouldn't he
hide it in the office?

360
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,654
Or maybe
she's hiding something.

361
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,726
Nothing but aspirin
and flu meds in the bathroom.

362
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,129
Looks Iike this stuff's been
sitting here for weeks.

363
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,231
CHASE: Home improvement.

364
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,242
He probably thought
he could take the project on,

365
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,143
then realized it was a Iittle
more than he could handle.

366
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,704
You got a point to make,
or did you just feel Iike
giving a Iong,

367
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,410
unnecessary explanation
for something
medically irrelevant?

368
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,544
What happened to the Foreman
who always has an answer?

369
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,713
The guy who practically
wears a sign saying,

370
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,780
"I'm as good as House,
but I'm nicer."

371
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,882
I never said that.

372
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,520
I guess it's safe to be
confident when House
is there to overrule you.

373
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,689
Now that it's all on you...

374
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,863
It's different. Yeah.

375
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,500
Either you Ieft it behind
on purpose, or by mistake.

376
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,734
The only reason you'd
Ieave it behind intentionally

377
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,803
is if it no Ionger
meant anything to you.

378
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,712
But since it was
a gift from your mom,

379
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,273
that would mean
you had a fight with her.

380
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,615
But since you don't talk
to ghosts, that's unlikely.

381
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,881
Leave it alone, Greg.

382
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:07,516
Yeah, I'm good at that.
So that Ieaves
forgetting it unintentionally.

383
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,162
But then we have to explain
why you didn't go back for it
when you realized...

384
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,026
I didn't realize
until I got to the airport.

385
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,931
Nope. You were wearing makeup
when you got to the airport.

386
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,299
You can't put on makeup
without Iooking at yourself.

387
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,361
You can't Iook at yourself
without touching that thing.

388
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,566
Why does this
matter to you?

389
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,238
It's an anomaly.
Anomalies bug me.

390
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,604

gonna suffer.

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,605
Are you hungry?
No.

00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,835
No, he's in pain.
Is it a sharp pain?

399
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,743
No. Teal indigent!

400
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,580

Yes.

401
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,882
A metallic taste?
Yes!

402
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,948
I'II be right back.

403
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,922
HOUSE: I suppose it's also
possible that the clasp broke,

404
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,093
but then you'd be carrying
the thing around
in your purse...

405
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,564
We had a fight.

406
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,124
We had a fight,
and I was angry
and not thinking straight,

407
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,363
and I walked out
without my makeup
and without my cross.

408
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,134
I stopped at the drugstore
to buy makeup,
but I couldn't buy a cross,

409
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,768
because they
don't have an aisle
for personal talismans!

410
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,743
So you had a fight.
I'm sure it'II blow over.

411
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,115
It was about nothing.
Of course it was.

412
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,713
Mark's tired. He's worried.
He's got mobility problems.

413
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,222
It's normal to blow up
over Iittle things.

414
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,816
I don't mind fighting
over Iittle things.

415
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,853
I didn't mind
fighting over big things.
That I could understand.

416
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,030
We fight over nothing.

417
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,363
You know, a mailbox
with a sign that says,
"Last pickup 5:00 p.m."

418
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,304
Does that mean Iast pickup
to go to the post office,

419
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,900
or Iast pickup to Ieave
the post office
and be sent out of town?

420
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,370
You fought over
mail delivery?

421
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,971
I tried to get him to drop
the subject, but he wouldn't.

422
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,539
I told him he was right.
He thought
I was being condescending.

423
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,879
You were.

424
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,219
He's pushing me
out of his Iife.

425
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,151
Maybe
you're misinterpreting.

and he's stable
for the moment.

Unlike Cuddy, who's suicidal.

It's either meningitis
or encephalitis.
Or maybe autoimmune.

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,071
I'm ready.

502
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,968
Right.

503
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,542
The hotel's upstairs.

504
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,941
Does Mark know
about this?

505
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,212
Mark knows that
when things are bad,

506
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,278
I always Iike to have
an escape route planned.

507
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,249
(DOOR OPENING)

508
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,168
(SIGHS)

509
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,974
I have to know
what's going on here.

510
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:17,712
Because when you
have a fight with Mark
and you try to avoid me,

511
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,580
then I have to
think that...

512
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,148
That I'm feeling vulnerable,
and I don't want to be
around you,

513
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,695
because it might Iead
to something.

514
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,957
Right.

515
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,024
But then,
a hotel room...

516
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,229
Might also
Iead to something.

517
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,629
So, which is it?

518
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,041
Our relationship's
Iike an addiction.

519
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,911
It's Iike...

520
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,311
Really good drugs?

521
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,182
No, it's Iike Vindaloo curry.

522
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,555
Okay, sure.

523
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,617
Really, really hot
Indian curry they make
with red chili peppers.

524
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,355
I know what it is.

525
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,794
Didn't think
it was addictive.

526
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,834
You're abrasive and annoying,
and you come on
way too strong.

527
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,735
Like Vindaloo curry.

528
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,602
And when you're crazy
about curry, that's fine.

529
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,732
But no matter
how much you Iove curry,

530
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,074
you have too much of it,
it takes
the roof of your mouth off.

531
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,308
And then you never want
to see curry for
a really, really Iong time.

532
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,976
But you wake up one day
and you think,

533
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,981
"God, I really miss curry."

534
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,263
You're a jerk.

535
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,668
I know.

536
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,202
If you hadn't just had
a fight with Mark...

537
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,001
For once in your Iife,
will you shut up?

538
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,638
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

539
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,251
House.

540
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,357
You're on speakerphone.

541
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,088
How did the LP go?

542
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,063
Give me the Reader's Digest
condensed version.

543
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,568
Preliminary results are
some kind of infection which

544
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,267
narrows it down...

545
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,335
From infinity, yeah.

546
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:54,240
At the rate his organs
are deteriorating,
he's got maybe a day or two.

547
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,607
Okay. Well, call me back
when you have something.

548
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,173
CAMERON: He was trying
to tell us something.

549
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,356
What did he say?

550
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,884
You were wrong.
It wasn't the fear.
He opened up to me when I...

551
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,057
A sympathetic presence
after a traumatic moment.

552
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,863
CIassic interrogation
technique. What did he say?

553
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,496
You knew that I'd...

554
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,098
Act the way you always do?
Yeah, I did. What did he say?

555
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,036
He couldn't tackle the bear.

556
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,412
Now all we need
is the English-Aphasic
dictionary.

557
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,039
A fluent aphasic retrieves
words that are stored

558
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,379
somewhere close
to the one he wants.

559
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,421
They could be filed by sound
or by meanings.

560
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,285
So if he wants to say "table,"

561
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,383
he could say "Iabel"
or he could say "chair."

562
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,894
Or he could just say
"jabberwocky."
There's no way to tell.

563
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,797
He also said,
"They took my stain."

564
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,296
Hold on.

565
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:59,566
I'm gonna take this phone
downstairs, so I don't
disturb you. Is that okay?

566
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:00,836
Sure.

567
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,373
Keep him talking.
Write down everything he says.

(SIGHS)

570
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,214
That new makeup you bought,
do you mind if I borrow it?

571
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,795
What did you mean by "stain"?
Dirty, soiled...

572
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,794
No, no.

573
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,474
What about rhymes?
Pain? Brain?

574
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,169
Thane?

575
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:37,537
He is dying from some kind of
infection, and you all are
playing word games?

576
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,344
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

577
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,551
Let's start this again.

578
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,932
"Bear." Is it "bare"
as in "naked"?

579
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,537
Crimson Desire
shows up well on Sheetrock.

580
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,674
That's why I chose it.

581
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,820
HOUSE: You must have gotten
one new phrase out of him.
Something.

582
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,853
We've been talking to him
for hours.
Maybe he's just given up.

583
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,694
You sure you've told me
everything you found
at his home and office?

584
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,463
No, we're
hiding something.

585
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,128
Maybe it's not
a rhyme or a synonym.

586
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,502
What else is there?

587
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,768
You think we should just
start guessing randomly?

588
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,639
Maybe House is wrong.

589
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,535
Hope that's not
the end of the thought.

590
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,810
He mentioned "stain"
once before, when Chase
was giving him the MRI.

591
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,078
Before we scared him.
He did?

592
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,914
It's in your notes.

593
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,253
CHASE: So he only talks during
MRIs and lumbar punctures?

594
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,460
Your theory is he can only
talk with a needle
in his back or...

595
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,894
When his wife's
not in the room.

596
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:39,397
The more devoted,
the more reason to Iie.

597
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,296
That's cynical.

598
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,702
You disagree?

599
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:47,210
No, I'm just kvelling.
Our Iittle girl is growing up.

600
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:51,444
Okay, what's the best way
to rip a woman from the side
of her dying husband?

601
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,508
You woke me up
to Iie to a patient's wife?

602
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,452
Tell her there's been
a miscommunication over
their insurance coverage.

603
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,046
Not a big deal.

604
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,285
Tell me.
If it is your aim to sell me

605
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,797
the same crazy ideas that
House does, how are you
an improvement on House?

606
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,798
I brought you a coffee.

00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,913
Are we in?
Yeah.

00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,280
Hi. I'm Gregory House.
I'm your attending physician.

613
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,249
Your wife's not there.
Start talking.

614
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,915
They took my stain.
I couldn't tackle the bear.

615
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,625
They took my stain.

616
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,130
Okay, shut up now.
Nice work, Cameron.
Give him the Iist again.

617
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,098
Let us know when
something sounds right.

618
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:47,160
Dirty, soiled, pain, brain...

619
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,296
Yes.

620
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,463
FOREMAN:
Where does that get us?

621
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,771
We're already paying plenty of
attention to his brain.

622
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,606
We've got an MRI, got a CT...

623
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,876
Are we sure he wasn't
reacting to "pain"?
He's been on painkillers.

624
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,473
HOUSE: Oh, come on, Chase.

625
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,552
Drugs didn't do this to him,
even if he is an addict.

626
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,621
I dissuade the tonal category.

627
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,216
Oh, please,
Mr. SIeeping Pills,
Amphetamines,

628
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,891

Gregory House to Gate 7.

631
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,238
Ever hear this one?

632
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,867
You build a house. Each wall
has a southern exposure.

633
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:30,207
A big bear comes wandering by.
What color is the bear?

634
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:34,341
White. It's a polar bear.
You built your house
in the North Pole.

635
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,648
Polar. Whatever your name is.
Patient! Are you bipolar?

636
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,723
What? I can't see.
Is he nodding?

637
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:43,885
Yes.

638
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,791
Topamax isn't just off-Iabel
for weight Ioss. It's
off-Iabel for mood disorders.

639
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:53,098
PIenty of bipolars are manic
in the daytime,
depressive at night.

640
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,697
He's been medicating for years
with alcohol, sleeping through
the bad hours.

641
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,241
It explains
the danger journalism.

642
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,176
Explains everything,
including the kitchen sink.

643
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,906
Okay, technically, it's
the kitchen cabinets.

644
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,073
He starts a project,
then he stops.

645
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,380
Except bipolar disorder
does not cause seizures.

646
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,886
And it doesn't shut down
your kidneys.
But what it does do...

647
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,286
GUARD: Excuse me, sir.
May I see your ID?

648
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,051
I'm on the phone.
I'm on the phone.

649
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,217
Now, please.

650
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,624
House? What is it?

651
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,821
I'm a doctor.
This is an emergency call.

652
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,727
You have to
come with me, sir.

653
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,232
I'm not going anywhere.
Do you think
you're gonna take me on?

654
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,030
I kick and I bite.

655
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,098
You're either on that plane,
or you're going into custody.

656
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,369
FOREMAN: House?

657
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,472
Are you still there?

658
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,407
Being bipolar
makes you take risks.

659
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,420
You seek excitement,
you make up stories.

660
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,022
I dime value tale Iever!

661
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:51,254
Fine, maybe your stories
are Iegit. But people
would start to wonder.

662
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,958
Annoyed politicians,
entire governments
would be on your ass.

663
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,968
So you couldn't tell anybody
you were bipolar.
Which was fine.

664
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,071
Until you fell in Iove.

665
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,132
And you wanted that Iife.

666
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,479
And you hear
that there's a surgical cure.

667
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,747
You can give the woman you
Iove the Iife she wants.

668
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,580
AII you have to do is change.

669
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,827
Bilateral cingulotomy.

670
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:28,189
An experimental surgery that
some people claim helps
mood disorders.

671
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:31,098
And if it's done by
Gamma Knife,
there's no trace of cutting.

672
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,897
That's the neural scarring
we saw on the MRI.

673
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,167
Which explained nothing,
because it wasn't even
in the right area.

674
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,970
It's not the surgery,
it's the secrecy.

675
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,468
What causes recurring fever,

676
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,603
neurological problems,

677
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,649
Iethargy that you fight
with caffeine pills
and amphetamines?

678
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,980
It wasn't
your secret psych disorder.

679
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,187
It wasn't your
secret daily drug use.

680
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,586
It was your secret trip
for your secret surgery

681
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,988
in Caracas or Buenos Aires.

682
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,218
Which, by the way,
didn't work, given the state
of your kitchen cabinets.

683
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,559
House. Shut up.

684
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,459
What's going on?

685
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,605
Is he right?

686
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:17,011
Your doctors know you
better than I do.

687
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,508
That man on the speakerphone,
he never even met you,

688
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,984
and he knows you
better than I do.

689
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,290
You Iove me?

690
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,690
Yes. Yes.

691
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,867
You just don't trust me.

692
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,502
HOUSE:
Get some blood on a slide.

693
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,542
Do not put it through
a computer this time.

694
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,701
Yeah.

695
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,817
FOREMAN: Cerebral malaria.

696
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,288
I'II get him started
on intravenous quinidine.

697
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:13,267
If a human being had actually
Iooked at his blood
anywhere along the way,

698
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,568
instead of just running tests
through the computer,

699
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,104
the parasites would have
jumped right out at them.

700
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,571
Price of the electronic age.

701
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,755
FIetch.

702
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,522
She'II be back.

703
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,429
Give her time to miss you.

704
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,007
MAN: (ON PA)
Final boarding call
for Flight Number 7...

705
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,177
I'm counting on you
to get me off the no-fly Iist.

706
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,982
Is your patient
gonna be all right?

707
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:07,080
Physically,
his chances are good.
Physically?

708
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,986
Two people who weren't
meant to be together.

709
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,961
Maybe they'II get
a happy ending just because
they both want it so much.

710
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,191
Yeah, that's usually
the way it works.

711
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,793
He Ioved her enough
to convince himself
he could change.

712
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,539
But he couldn't, could he?

713
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,474
Thank you.

714
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,541
You know what Woody AIIen said
about relationships.

715
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,141
Irrational and crazy,
but we go through it all
because...

716
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,880
We need the curry.
