1
00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:04,400
And these specific omens,
they're prelude to what?

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:05,901
The Four Horsemen.

3
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:07,767
- And which one rides the red horse?
- War.

4
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:08,867
You can't kill war, kiddos.

5
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:10,400
Oh, we know.

6
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:11,467
The ring. The ring.

7
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:12,734
Aaah!

8
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:15,967
You can't stop thinking about it...

9
00:00:16,002 --> 00:00:18,236
ever since you saw it dripping
off the blade of that knife.

10
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:22,107
Blood, blood, blood.

11
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:23,875
I'm not some junkie!

12
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:27,345
I think that the
"Dean and Sam" story sucks!

13
00:00:27,413 --> 00:00:29,381
It is not fun. 
It's not entertaining.

14
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:31,316
It is a river of crap

15
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:34,052
that would send most people
howling to the nut-house!

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,754
How many people
do you have to save?

17
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:36,921
All of 'em.

18
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,523
How do you get up in the morning?

19
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:39,758
That's a good question.

20
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:41,059
I'm just tired, man

21
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,962
and I'm done.

22
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,863
I am just done.

23
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:05,150
First date.

24
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:07,719
I had a really good time tonight, Russell.

25
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:13,792
Alice...

26
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,161
Can I see you again?

27
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,097
Sunday, maybe?

28
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:21,366
I just don't want to be alone

29
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:23,001
on Valentine's Day...

30
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:24,269
again.

31
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:26,671
I know what you mean.

32
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,024
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:48,193
I just... I... I don't want you to think

34
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,260
I'm the type of person who...

35
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:50,128
No, I should apologize...

36
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:51,963
Mm!

37
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:54,999
Ugh!

38
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:05,643
Oh, god.

39
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:08,446
<i>I respect the crap out
of you right now.</i>

40
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:09,714
Shut up!

41
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:18,890
Ah! Ugh!

42
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:19,891
Your neck!

43
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,359
I think I bit you.

44
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:23,828
It's okay.

45
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:24,996
It's okay.

46
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:34,406
Ugh! I've been so alone.

47
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:36,040
So empty...

48
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:37,876
I know, me too.

49
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:40,512
I want you, Russell...

50
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,881
all of you... Inside me...

51
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:43,848
Yes.

52
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:48,086
Ugh!

53
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:01,900
Aah!

54
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,401
Ugh!

55
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:13,402
Supernatural Season 5 Episode 14
"My Bloody Valentine"

56
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:19,350
So...

57
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:22,253
You were the one who found the bodies?

58
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:25,223
There was blood everywhere...

59
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,925
and... other stuff.

60
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,995
I think Alice was already dead.

61
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:32,764
But Russell wasn't?

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,668
I think he was, mostly,

63
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:41,039
except... he was still sort of...

64
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:43,208
chewing a little.

65
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,642
Oh.

66
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:47,745
Uh-huh.

67
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:52,517
How could two
people even do that?

68
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,118
Eat each other to death?

69
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:56,321
That's a really good question.

70
00:03:56,388 --> 00:03:58,189
Now, the last few days,

71
00:03:58,257 --> 00:03:59,791
did you notice her acting erratically?

72
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,292
How do you mean?

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
I mean, did she seem...

74
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:04,028
unusually hostile, aggressive?

75
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:06,297
No way.

76
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:09,767
Alice never drank, never even swore.

77
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,469
She was a nice girl.

78
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:14,239
And I'm talking like, a nice girl,

79
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,040
like she still had her promise ring,

80
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,509
if you know what I mean.

81
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:18,776
She was a virgin?

82
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:20,044
No premarital.

83
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:22,080
I used to wonder how she did it,

84
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:25,650
<i>I mean, you know, didn't do it.</i>

85
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,790
It was her first date in months.

86
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:36,828
She was so excited.

87
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:40,298
Apparently, they were
both pretty excited.

88
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:46,404
How'd it go?

89
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:47,705
Um...

90
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:49,841
No EMF, no sulphur.

91
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,443
Ghost possession and demonic possession

92
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,078
are both probably out.

93
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:55,446
Hmm. That's where I
was puttin' my money.

94
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:57,181
Nope.

95
00:04:57,249 --> 00:04:58,483
Well, then what then?

96
00:04:58,551 --> 00:04:59,751
Oh, dude!

97
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:02,954
At the coroner's you
didn't see these bodies.

98
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,189
I mean, these two started eating

99
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:07,292
and, and they just... kept going.

100
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:10,094
I mean, their stomachs were full.

101
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:12,764
Like... like... Thanksgiving-dinner full.

102
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,399
Talk about co-dependent.

103
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,834
Well...

104
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:21,339
I mean, we got our feelers out.
How much more can we do tonight.

105
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:23,041
All right.

106
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:25,243
I'm just gonna go
through some files,

107
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:26,978
you can go ahead and get going.

108
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:29,113
Sorry?

109
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:30,949
Go ahead. Unleash the Kraken.

110
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,317
See you tomorrow morning.

111
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:35,420
Where am I going?

112
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,554
Dean, it's valentine's day.

113
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:38,256
Your favorite holiday, remember?

114
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:40,091
I mean, what do
you always call it... uh,

115
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,093
unattached drifter Christmas?

116
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:43,094
Yeah.

117
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:44,429
Oh, yeah.

118
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:47,832
Well... be that as it may.

119
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,067
I don't know,

120
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:51,703
guess I'm not feeling it this year.

121
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,440
So you're not into bars
full of lonely women?

122
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,710
Nah, I guess not.

123
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,245
Ahh.

124
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:02,513
What?

125
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:03,948
It's when a dog doesn't eat,

126
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:05,883
that's when you know
something's really wrong.

127
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:10,188
Remarkably patronizing
concern duly noted.

128
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,690
Nothings wrong. We
gonna work or what?

129
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,169
<i>Ouch! No me gusta.</i>

130
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:26,871
Have you been proofing
this thing, Jimbo?

131
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,239
Sorry?

132
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:30,975
Tell me you are not checking
your cellphone again!

133
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,244
Man, she's got you on a leash.

134
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:34,846
I'm not on a leash, Brad.

135
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,014
She just wants to know where I am.

136
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:37,248
She just wants to know
that you're whipped.

137
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:38,416
It's not like that.

138
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:39,484
Oh, yeah. It's like...

139
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:42,220
Brad, just give me two minutes.

140
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:43,354
No, man. No.

141
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:44,989
I'm the project leader on this thing,

142
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:46,290
and I'm not gonna half-ass it

143
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:48,559
just 'cause my wingman
has gone mental

144
00:06:48,627 --> 00:06:50,762
over some chick he
met, like, a week ago.

145
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:52,764
Jim?

146
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:56,467
Holy crap.

147
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,603
Where were you?

148
00:06:58,671 --> 00:06:59,604
I know.

149
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:01,639
It's just I had to...

150
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:05,610
You can't choose
work over me, Jim!

151
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,078
I won't, Janice.

152
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:08,379
I'm sorry...

153
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:10,214
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

154
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:12,684
Jimbo, due respect, but honestly bro...

155
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:18,289
What are we gonna do, Jimmy?

156
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:19,624
I don't know, baby.

157
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:21,626
Seems like whatever we do,

158
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:23,961
something in life is always
gonna keep us apart...

159
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,231
work, family, sleep.

160
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,500
Now prison, maybe...

161
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:32,103
Maybe.

162
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:36,741
But I think I have an idea,

163
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:40,378
how we can stay together...

164
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:41,846
forever...

165
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:16,714
You okay?

166
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:18,149
Yeah, I'm fine.

167
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:31,729
Agent Marley, you just can't stay away.

168
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:33,598
Heard you tagged
another double suicide.

169
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:35,333
Well, I just finished closing them up.

170
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,335
Dr. Corman, this is my partner,
special agent Cliff.

171
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:38,369
Agent Cliff.

172
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:39,937
I've finished my pre-lims.

173
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:43,174
I pulled the organ sets and
sent off the tox samples.

174
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,143
Great. You mind if we
take a look at the bodies?

175
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,177
Not at all.

176
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:47,612
But like I said...

177
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,115
their... good-and-plenties
are already tupperwared.

178
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:52,817
Super.

179
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:54,385
Just leave the keys
with Marty up front.

180
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:57,054
And please, gentlemen,

181
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:59,957
refrigerate after opening.

182
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:07,298
Hey.

183
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,234
Be my valentine?

184
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Wait a second.

185
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:26,250
These hearts both have identical marks.

186
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,187
Check this out.

187
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:31,656
It looks like some kind of letter.

188
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:34,458
Oh, no.

189
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:36,561
What?

190
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,332
I think it's Enochian.

191
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,634
You mean like angel scratches?

192
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:49,006
So you think it's like
the tagging on our ribs?

193
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:50,474
Dean, I don't know.

194
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,009
Ah, hell.

195
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:58,916
Cass, it's Dean.

196
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:01,385
Yeah, room 31-C, basement level...

197
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:03,221
St. James Medical Centre.

198
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:04,755
I'm there now.

199
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,858
Yeah, I get that.

200
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:09,293
I'm gonna hang up now.

201
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:11,429
Right.

202
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:19,036
You're right, Sam. These
are angelic marks.

203
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:21,005
I imagine you'll find similar marks

204
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:22,840
on the other couples' hearts as well.

205
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:25,142
So, what are they? I mean,
what do they mean?

206
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,878
It's a mark of union.

207
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,814
This man and woman
were intended to mate.

208
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:32,049
Okay, but who put them there?

209
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:35,119
Well, your people call them "Cupid."

210
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:36,621
A what?

211
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:40,691
What human myth has
mistaken for "Cupid",

212
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,994
is actually a lower order of angel.

213
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,496
Technically it's a Cherub, third-class.

214
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:46,931
Cherub?

215
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:49,066
Yeah, they're all over the world.

216
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:50,434
There are dozens of them.

217
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:52,570
You mean the little
flying fat kid in diapers?

218
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:54,739
They're not incontinent.

219
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:56,774
Okay, anyways.

220
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:58,342
So, what you're saying is...

221
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,544
What I'm saying is a
Cupid has gone rogue,

222
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:03,180
and we have to stop him,
before he kills again.

223
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:05,883
Naturally.

224
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:07,885
Of course we do.

225
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,337
So, what, you just happen to know

226
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,672
he likes the cosmos at this place?

227
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,707
This place is a nexus
of human reproduction.

228
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:30,908
it's exactly the kind of...

229
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:36,113
of garden the Cupid will
come to... to pollinate.

230
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:43,587
Wait a minute.

231
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:45,790
You're not hungry?

232
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:48,292
No.

233
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:51,329
What? I'm not hungry.

234
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,064
Then you're not gonna finish that?

235
00:11:59,004 --> 00:11:59,971
He's here.

236
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:02,740
Where?

237
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:03,641
I don't see anything.

238
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:13,417
There.

239
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,621
You mean the same-sid
e-of-the-booth couple over there?

240
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,457
Meet me in the back.

241
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,601
Cass, where is he?

242
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:32,269
I have him tethered.

243
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:37,508
Zoda kama mahrana.

244
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:39,443
Manifest yourself.

245
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,953
So, where is he?

246
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,054
Oof!

247
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:53,190
Here I am!

248
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:03,052
Help!

249
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,787
Oh, help is on the way.

250
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:06,456
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

251
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:08,892
Hello, you!

252
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:13,230
- Ooh.
- Mmm.

253
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,465
This is Cupid?

254
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:16,366
Yes.

255
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:18,969
And look at you, huh?

256
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:20,737
- No.
- Yes!

257
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:22,539
Yes, yes, yes!

258
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,508
Is this a fight? Are we in a fight?

259
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:27,477
This is... their handshake.

260
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,546
- I don't like it.
- No one likes it.

261
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,949
Mmm.

262
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:37,320
What can I do for you?

263
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:38,188
Why are you doing this?

264
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:39,489
Doing what?

265
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,058
Your targets, the ones you've marked...

266
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,225
they're slaughtering each other.

267
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:44,561
What?

268
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:47,397
They are?

269
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:48,698
Listen, birthday suit,

270
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,867
we know, okay?

271
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:52,169
We know you been flittin' around,

272
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,703
popping people with your poison arrow,

273
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:55,105
making them murder each other!

274
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:58,208
<i>What we don't know is why.</i>

275
00:13:58,276 --> 00:13:59,576
You think that I...

276
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,414
Well, uh...

277
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:06,950
I don't know what to say.

278
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:19,329
Should...

279
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:21,331
should somebody maybe...
go talk to him?

280
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,300
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Give 'em hell, Cass.

281
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,442
Um... look.

282
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,914
We didn't mean to, um...

283
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,454
hurt your feelings.

284
00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:46,089
Ugh!

285
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,358
Love is more than a
word to me, you know.

286
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:49,726
<i>I love, love. I love it!</i>

287
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,928
And if that's wrong, I
don't want to be right!

288
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:54,498
Yes, yes. Of course.

289
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:55,799
I, uh...

290
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:58,001
I have no idea what you're saying.

291
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,303
It's just on my appointed rounds.

292
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:02,305
Whatever my targets do after that,

293
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,974
that's nothing to do with me.

294
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,543
I-I was following my orders.

295
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:10,580
Please brother. Read my mind.

296
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:14,957
Read my mind, you'll see.

297
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,425
He's telling the truth.

298
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:24,494
jiny Christmas. Thank you.

299
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:25,729
Wait, wait...

300
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,564
You said you were
just following orders?

301
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:28,431
Mm-hmm.

302
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:29,499
<i>Whose orders?</i>

303
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,301
Whose orders..?

304
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:33,937
Heaven, silly. Heaven.

305
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:37,575
Why does heaven care
if Harry meets Sally?

306
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:40,710
Oh mostly they don't. You know,
certain bloodlines, certain destinies.

307
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:42,512
- Oh, like yours.
- What?

308
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,115
Yeah, the union of
John and Mary Winchester...

309
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:47,918
Very big deal upstairs, top
priority arrangement. Mmm.

310
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:49,986
Are you saying that you
fixed-up our parents?

311
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:52,155
Well, not me, but... yeah.

312
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:54,157
Well, it wasn't easy, either.

313
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:55,559
Ooh, they couldn't stand
each other at first,

314
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,560
but when we were
done with them...

315
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:57,827
perfect couple.

316
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:59,162
- Perfect?
- Yeah.

317
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,530
They're dead!

318
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:04,668
I'm sorry, but...
the orders were very clear.

319
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,470
You and Sam needed to be born.

320
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:09,406
Your parents were just, uh...

321
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:11,074
meant to be.

322
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:12,909
A match made in heaven

323
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:14,110
heaven!

324
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,414
Son of a bitch!

325
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,385
Where is he?

326
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:23,553
Where'd he go?!

327
00:16:23,621 --> 00:16:25,355
I believe you upset him.

328
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:26,823
Upset him?!

329
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:28,358
Dean, enough!

330
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:29,459
What?

331
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:30,760
You just punched a Cupid!

332
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:32,762
I punched a dick!

333
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,564
Um...

334
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:36,132
Are we gonna talk about

335
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,269
what's been up with
you lately or not?

336
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:40,804
Or not.

337
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,385
You said you wanted to hear about

338
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:57,120
any other weird ones.

339
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,022
Okay.

340
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,997
Lester Finch.

341
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:08,465
Pulled his records.

342
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:11,668
Looks like this gentleman used
to weigh 400 pounds or so,

343
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:13,470
till he got a gastric bypass,

344
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:16,039
which brought down
his weight considerably.

345
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,708
But then for some reason, last night,

346
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,077
he decided to go
on a Twinkie binge.

347
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,914
So, he died from a Twinkie binge?

348
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:28,518
Well, after he blew out the
band around his stomach,

349
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,754
he filled it up till it burst.

350
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:32,889
When he could no longer swallow,

351
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:35,558
he started jamming the
cakes down his gullet

352
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:36,993
with a...

353
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:39,229
with a toilet brush,

354
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:43,600
like he was ramrod ding a cannon.

355
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:47,971
So, what do you make of it?

356
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,739
I'd say that it was

357
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,841
a very peculiar thing to do.

358
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:54,644
Hey.

359
00:17:54,712 --> 00:17:56,813
So, uh, this guy was
not marked by Cupid,

360
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,882
but his death is definitely suspicious.

361
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:01,484
Yeah, well, I just went
through the police blotter,

362
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:02,652
and counting him,

363
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,454
that's eight suicides since Wednesday

364
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:05,789
and 19 O.D'S...

365
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:08,058
that's way out of the
seasonal batting average.

366
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,560
Yeah, if there's a pattern here,
it ain't just love.

367
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,662
It's a hell of a lot bigger than we thought.

368
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,364
Yeah, all right. I'll see you in 10.

369
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,932
Yep, okay.

370
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,797
Ugh! Ugh!

371
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:50,467
I know what you are, damn it.

372
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:51,601
Aaah!

373
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,603
I could smell you.

374
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,572
Winchester.

375
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:03,480
Aah!

376
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,610
What the hell does a demon
got to do with this, anyway?

377
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,378
Believe me, I got no idea.

378
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:39,315
You okay?

379
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:42,519
Yeah, yeah. I'll be all right.

380
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:47,524
Let's crack her open.

381
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:50,226
What's the worst that
could happen, right?

382
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:02,539
Whoa!

383
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:09,446
What the hell was that?

384
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:11,047
It's a human soul.

385
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,619
It's starting to make sense.

386
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:19,222
Now, what about that makes sense?

387
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,290
And when did you start eating?

388
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,491
Exactly.

389
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,560
My hunger... it's a clue, actually.

390
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:26,029
- For what?
- For what?

391
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,363
This town isn't suffering

392
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:28,865
from some love-gone-wrong effect.

393
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:30,166
It's suffering from hunger.

394
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:32,535
Starvation, to be exact...

395
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:34,170
specifically...

396
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:35,171
famine.

397
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,006
Famine?

398
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:39,042
A-as in The Horseman?

399
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,143
Great.

400
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:41,945
Th-th-that's freaking great.

401
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:44,948
I thought famine meant starvation,

402
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:47,350
like as in, you know, food.

403
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,052
Yes. Absolutely.

404
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,920
But not just food.

405
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,022
I mean, everyone seems to
be starving for something...

406
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,228
sex, attention, drugs, love...

407
00:20:58,295 --> 00:20:59,462
Well, that explains

408
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,064
the puppy-lovers
that Cupid shot up.

409
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:02,198
Right.

410
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,234
The Cherub made them crave love,

411
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:07,003
and then famine came,
and made them rabid for it.

412
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,671
Okay, but what about you?

413
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:10,340
I mean, since when do angels

414
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:11,975
secretly hunger for white castle?

415
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:17,547
It's my vessel... Jimmy.

416
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:21,017
His, uh, appetite for red meat

417
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:24,988
has been touched
by famine's effect.

418
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:26,756
So, famine just rolls into town

419
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,091
and everybody goes crazy?

420
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:35,265
"And then will come famine
riding on a black steed."

421
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:40,670
"He will ride into the land of plenty..."

422
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:03,259
"and great will be The Horseman's hunger,

423
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:06,329
for he is hunger."

424
00:22:13,637 --> 00:22:18,274
"His hunger will seep
out and poison the air."

425
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:49,372
Hungry.

426
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,807
Famine is hungry.

427
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:53,910
He must devour the
souls of his victims.

428
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:56,813
So, that's what was in the briefcase,

429
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,881
the Twinkie dude's soul?

430
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:05,688
Lucifer has sent his
demons to care for famine,

431
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:08,858
to feed him, make
certain he'll be ready.

432
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,059
Ready for what?

433
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:14,497
To march across the land.

434
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,985
Hungry.

435
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:40,023
Sam Winchester, the vessel...

436
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,557
he's here.

437
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,526
Where?

438
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:45,194
At the hospital.

439
00:23:45,262 --> 00:23:48,197
We fought, but he got away.

440
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:50,833
I...

441
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,403
<i>I got this off him.</i>

442
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,972
Good. Yes.

443
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,474
After lunch.

444
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:02,211
Now, where is it?

445
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,946
Sorry?

446
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:08,584
The one who
loves cream cake so much.

447
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:10,319
Where is his soul?

448
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:17,060
I am sorry. No. The...

449
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:20,596
Winchester took the case from me.

450
00:24:20,664 --> 00:24:23,232
Uh, he had the knife.

451
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,333
I...

452
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:29,439
I lost it.

453
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:30,907
But I'm hungry!

454
00:24:30,974 --> 00:24:33,476
I'll get another. I-I won't be 10 minutes.

455
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:36,312
Hungry! Now!

456
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:59,402
Delicious!

457
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,049
Famine?

458
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:17,450
Yes.

459
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,187
So, what, this whole town

460
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:22,289
is just gonna eat, drink,
and screw itself to death?

461
00:25:22,357 --> 00:25:23,724
We should stop it.

462
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,159
Yeah, that's a great idea.

463
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,460
How?

464
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,329
How did you stop the
last Horseman you met?

465
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,502
War got his mojo from this ring.

466
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,907
And after we cut it off,
he just tucked tail and ran.

467
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:42,543
And everybody that was affected,

468
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,211
it was like they woke
up out of a dream.

469
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,879
You think famine's
got a class ring, too?

470
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:47,147
I know he does.

471
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:48,449
Well, okay.

472
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:50,784
L-let's track him down
and get to chopping.

473
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:52,186
Yeah.

474
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:57,057
What are you, the ham-burglar?

475
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,526
I've developed
a taste for ground beef.

476
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:02,429
Well, have you
even tried to stop it?

477
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,331
I'm an angel. I can
stop anytime I want.

478
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,699
Whatever.

479
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,835
Sam, let's roll.

480
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:10,437
Dean...

481
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:11,705
I, um...

482
00:26:11,773 --> 00:26:14,408
I can't.

483
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:17,244
I can't go.

484
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:18,912
What do you mean?

485
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,415
I think it got to me, Dean.

486
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:24,017
I think I'm hungry for it...

487
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:26,320
Hungry for what?

488
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:27,387
You know.

489
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,656
Demon blood?

490
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,593
You got to be kidding me.

491
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,827
You got to get him out of here.

492
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:35,095
You got to beam him
to, like, Montana,

493
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:36,296
anywhere but here.

494
00:26:36,364 --> 00:26:37,965
It won't work. He's already infected.

495
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:39,933
The hunger is just
gonna travel with him.

496
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,201
Well, then, what do we do?

497
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:43,303
You go cut that bastard's finger off.

498
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:51,044
You heard him.

499
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:52,613
But, Dean...

500
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,682
Before you go, you better...

501
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,786
you better lock me down.

502
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,588
But good.

503
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:09,596
All right, well, just hang in there,

504
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:11,165
we'll be back as soon as we can.

505
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,533
Be careful,

506
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,201
and... hurry.

507
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:42,029
Hey, Marty.

508
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,864
Is Dr. Corman around?

509
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:45,465
You haven't heard?

510
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,434
Heard what?

511
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:57,778
Guy's been dry for the last 20 years,

512
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:00,681
but this morning, he
left work, went home,

513
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:02,616
and drank himself to death.

514
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,851
- It's famine.
- Pardon?

515
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,753
Would you give us a minute, please?

516
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:07,988
Sure.

517
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:09,556
Thanks.

518
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:17,030
Crap!

519
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:20,133
I really kind of liked this guy.

520
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,107
They haven't harvested his soul yet.

521
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:31,778
Well, if we want to
play "follow the soul"

522
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:33,013
to get to famine,

523
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:35,616
our best shot starts
with the doc, here.

524
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:03,377
Are you serious?

525
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:10,250
These make me...

526
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:12,519
very happy.

527
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,356
How many is that?

528
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:18,091
I lost count.

529
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,326
It's in the low hundreds.

530
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:25,999
What I don't understand is...

531
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:28,001
where is your hunger, Dean?

532
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:29,002
Huh?

533
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,905
Well, slowly but surely,

534
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:34,474
everyone in this town is
falling prey to famine,

535
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,143
but so far, you seem unaffected.

536
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:39,646
Hey, when I want to drink, I drink.

537
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,815
When I want sex, I go get it.

538
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:44,284
Same goes for a
sandwich or a fight.

539
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:45,419
So...

540
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:47,354
you're saying you're
just well-adjusted?

541
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:49,523
God, no. I'm just well-fed.

542
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:53,593
Look there.

543
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:15,350
Ugh!

544
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:19,922
Guys?

545
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:25,227
Guys, what happened?
I don't think it worked.

546
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:27,029
I think I'm still...

547
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:30,766
still hungry.

548
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:32,534
Look at this.

549
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:34,269
Someone trussed you up for us.

550
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:37,072
Boss says we can't kill you...

551
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:41,043
but I bet we can
break off a few pieces.

552
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:52,321
Ugh!

553
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,062
Ugh!

554
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:07,669
Get him off! Get him off!

555
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:22,584
Wait your turn.

556
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:40,803
Demons.

557
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,541
You want to go over the plan again?

558
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,378
Hey, happy meal.

559
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:51,113
The plan?

560
00:31:51,181 --> 00:31:53,215
I take the knife, I go in,

561
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:54,783
I cut off the ring hand of famine,

562
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:56,518
and I meet you back
here in the parking lot.

563
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:00,289
Well, that sounds foolproof.

564
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:13,602
This is taking too long.

565
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:49,404
Cass!

566
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:17,612
Cass.

567
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,483
The other Mr. Winchester.

568
00:33:20,051 --> 00:33:21,718
What did you do to him?

569
00:33:21,786 --> 00:33:26,122
You sicked your dog on me.
I just threw him a steak.

570
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,291
So this is your big trick?

571
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,894
Huh?

572
00:33:30,962 --> 00:33:32,662
Making people cookoo for cocoa puffs?

573
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,433
Doesn't take much... hardly a push.

574
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,136
Oh, America... all-you
can-eat, all of the time.

575
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:41,771
Consume, consume.

576
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,508
A swarm of locusts in stretch pants,

577
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:49,012
and yet, you're all still starving

578
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,750
because hunger doesn't
just come from the body,

579
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:56,786
it also comes from the soul.

580
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:59,289
It's funny, it doesn't seem
to be coming from mine.

581
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:00,957
Yes.

582
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:03,026
I noticed that.

583
00:34:03,094 --> 00:34:06,496
Have you wondered why that is?

584
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:10,467
How you could even
walk in my presence?

585
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:11,968
Well, I like to think

586
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:14,738
It's because of my
strength of character.

587
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:18,308
I disagree.

588
00:34:27,184 --> 00:34:28,151
Yes.

589
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,886
I see.

590
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:39,129
That's one deep, dark
nothing you got there, Dean.

591
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:42,966
Can't fill it, can you?

592
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:46,236
Not with food or drink.

593
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:47,937
Not even with sex.

594
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,472
Oh, you're so full of crap.

595
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,576
Oh, you can smirk and joke
and lie to your brother,

596
00:34:53,644 --> 00:34:56,446
lie to yourself, but not to me!

597
00:34:56,514 --> 00:35:00,283
I can see inside you, Dean.

598
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:05,488
I can see how broken you are,

599
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:06,923
how defeated,

600
00:35:06,991 --> 00:35:09,793
you can't win,
and you know it.

601
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,429
But you just keep fighting,

602
00:35:12,496 --> 00:35:18,001
just... keep going
through the motions.

603
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:21,404
You're not hungry,
Dean because inside,

604
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,906
you're already...

605
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:24,874
dead.

606
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:29,379
Let him go.

607
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,918
Sam...

608
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,388
Sammy, no!

609
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:40,557
Stop!

610
00:35:40,624 --> 00:35:45,695
No one lays a finger on
this sweet little boy.

611
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:50,266
Sam, I see you got
the snack I sent you.

612
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:53,069
You sent?

613
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:56,172
Don't worry. You're
not like everyone else.

614
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,075
You'll never die from
drinking too much.

615
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:02,946
You're the exception
that proves the rule,

616
00:36:03,013 --> 00:36:03,980
just the way...

617
00:36:04,048 --> 00:36:06,783
Satan wanted you to be.

618
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:09,252
So...

619
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:13,656
cut their throats.

620
00:36:13,724 --> 00:36:15,525
Have at them!

621
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:17,127
Sammy, no!

622
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:20,196
Please, be my guest.

623
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:03,740
No.

624
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:06,276
Well...

625
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:08,478
fine.

626
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:13,116
If you don't want them...

627
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:16,152
then I'll have them.

628
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,714
I'm a Horseman, Sam.

629
00:37:44,782 --> 00:37:49,085
Your power doesn't work on me.

630
00:37:49,153 --> 00:37:52,021
You're right.

631
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,657
But it will work on them.

632
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:21,017
Aahh!

633
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:51,796
Help! Help! Dean!

634
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,834
Guys, if you're out there, please.

635
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:57,305
Help!

636
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:05,678
That's not him in there.

637
00:39:05,746 --> 00:39:08,014
Not really.

638
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,017
- Dean, help me. Cass!
- I know.

639
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:15,604
Dean, Sam just has to get
it out of his system.

640
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:17,239
Then he'll be...

641
00:39:17,307 --> 00:39:20,309
Listen, I just, uh...

642
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:22,578
I just need to get some air.

643
00:40:13,063 --> 00:40:14,163
Please...

644
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,367
I can't...

645
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:27,977
I need some help.

646
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:34,049
Please.
