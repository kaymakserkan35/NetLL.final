1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:02,952
Look, dad's gone now.
We have to carry out his legacy.

2
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:07,190
And that means hunting
down as many evil sons of
bitches as we possibly can.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,357
- Lisa.
- Dean.

4
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:13,857
If you want to stick around
for a while,

5
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:15,000
You're welcome to stay.

6
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:18,761
I can't. I got a lot of work
to do, and it's not my life.

7
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:20,388
Bela talbot's her real name.

8
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:23,198
I procure unique items
for a select clientele.

9
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:24,222
A thief.

10
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:25,602
<I>A great thief.

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:28,507
Sam, you want to break
Dean free of that demon deal,

12
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:30,317
You ain't gonna
find the answer in no book.

13
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:33,198
- Then where, Bobby?
- Kid, I wish I knew.

14
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:35,348
I've been busting my ass
trying to keep you alive, Dean,

15
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:36,777
And you act like
you couldn't care less.

16
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,967
<I>I don't want you
to worry about me, Dean.

17
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,634
<I>I want you
to worry about you.

18
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:42,777
I want you to give a crap
that you're dying.

19
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:45,277
Every damn demon,
they were all human once?

20
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:46,777
<I>Every one I've ever met.

21
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,523
The answer is yes,
by the way -- The same
thing will happen to you.

22
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:52,666
There's no way of saving me
from the pit, is there?

23
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,737
No.

24
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,180
Oh. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:00,395
Sir?

26
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,847
Wake up.

27
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:14,786
Wake up! You hear me?
Wake up!

28
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:17,069
Sir, wake up!

29
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:19,378
Help!
I need some help in here!

30
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,156
* down around the corner

31
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:47,159
* half a mile from here

32
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,859
* you see them long trains
runnin' *

33
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,442
* and you watch them disappear

34
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,392
There you are.
What are you doing?

35
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,449
Having a drink.

36
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,616
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
Drinking whiskey?

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,392
- I drink whiskey all the time.
- No, you don't.

38
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:03,005
What's the big deal?
You get sloppy in bars.

39
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:05,559
<I>You hit on chicks all the time.
Why can't I?

40
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:10,838
It's kind of slim pickings
around here.

41
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:11,886
What's going on with you?

42
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,559
* she lost her home
and her family *

43
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,492
* and she won't be coming back

44
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:17,259
* without love

45
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:20,155
I tried, Dean.

46
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,274
To do what?

47
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:22,993
To save you.

48
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,292
Can I get a whiskey?
Double, neat.

49
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:31,512
- I'm serious, Dean.
- No, you're drunk.

50
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:34,234
I mean,
where you're going...

51
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:37,259
what you're gonna become.

52
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,893
I can't stop it.

53
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:46,026
I'm starting to think
maybe even ruby can't stop it.

54
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:50,790
But, really, the thing is,
no one can save you.

55
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,623
- What I've been telling you.
- No, that's not what I mean.

56
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:56,456
I mean, no one can
save you because you
don't want to be saved.

57
00:03:57,242 --> 00:04:00,409
I mean, how can you care
so little about yourself?

58
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:04,793
What's wrong with you?

59
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:11,512
Hello?

60
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:13,593
Yes, this is
mr. Snyderson.

61
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,853
What?

62
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,326
Where?

63
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:28,559
So, what's
the diagnosis?

64
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:31,159
We've tested everything
we can think to test.

65
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:32,908
He seems
perfectly healthy.

66
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:34,003
Except that
he's comatose.

67
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:37,359
Mr. Snyderson,
you're his emergency contact.

68
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:39,693
Anything we should know?
Any illnesses?

69
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:43,292
No, he never gets sick.
I mean, he doesn't even
catch a cold.

70
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:46,463
Doctor, is there
anything you can do?

71
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,773
Look, I'm sorry,

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,059
But we don't know
what's causing it,

73
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:53,701
So we don't know
how to treat it.

74
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,593
He just...

75
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:59,159
went to sleep
and didn't wake up.

76
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:11,526
So, what was Bobby doing
in Pittsburgh?

77
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:14,645
I dunno, unless he's taking an extremely lame vacation

78
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:17,741
But he must've been working a job, right?

79
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:22,384
Well you'd think there must be
some sort of sign or something,
you know

80
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,486
Research

81
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,986
News clippings

82
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:33,486
A frigging pizza box or a beer can

83
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,137
How 'bout this?

84
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:51,050
Good old Bob, he always covered up his tracks

85
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:54,145
You make heads or tails of any of this?

86
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,454
"Silene capensis,"

87
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:01,311
<I>Which, of course, means
absolutely nothing to me.

88
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,097
Here, obit

89
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:07,757
Dr. Walter gregg, 64,
university neurologist.

90
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,091
How'd he bite it?

91
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:10,629
Um, actually,
they don't know.

92
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:13,652
They say he just went to sleep
and didn't wake up.

93
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,232
That sound familiar
to you?

94
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,660
All right, um...

95
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:21,970
so, let's say Bobby was
looking into the doc's death,

96
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:24,160
- You know,hunting after something...
- that started hunting him.

97
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,255
Yeah.

98
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,324
All right, stay here.
See if you can make
heads or tails of this.

99
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,335
<I>What are you gonna do?

100
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:30,824
I'm gonna look into
the good doctor myself.

101
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:37,091
So, you're
dr. Gregg's lab assistant.

102
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:39,191
That's right.

103
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:42,557
Well, his death must have
come as a shock to you.

104
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,258
Yeah, it did.

105
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,485
But, still,
go in your sleep, peaceful --

106
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,985
It's what you wish for,
right?

107
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,158
Yeah, right.

108
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:54,033
Dr. Gregg, uh,
studied sleeping disorders?

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,557
Dreams?

110
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,509
I don't understand.

111
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:58,493
I went over all of this
with the other detective.

112
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,969
You already spoke
to another detective?

113
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:02,398
Yes, a very nice older man
with a beard.

114
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,064
Well, I'd love to hear it again,
if you don't mind.

115
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:07,826
Thing is, I'm sort of busy.
Maybe we could do this later?

116
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,358
Sure. Yeah.

117
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:12,882
I'll just bring you down to
the station later this afternoon

118
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:16,310
And get your statement on tape,
do it all official-Like.

119
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:20,310
Look, okay, I didn't know about
dr. Gregg's experiments --

120
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,882
Not until I was
cleaning out his files.

121
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:25,461
His experiments -- The ones
he was conducting on sleeping?

122
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:28,757
No one knew, okay?
Not the university, not anybody.

123
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:30,690
I already spoke
with a lawyer,

124
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,957
And he told me that I can't
be held liable for anything.

125
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,627
T1maybe you couldn't,

126
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:38,318
But that was before
the new evidence came to light.

127
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:40,091
- New evidence?
- Mm-Hmm.

128
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:41,492
What n evidence?

129
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,159
I'm not at liberty
to say.

130
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,802
Look,
I'm just a grad student.

131
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:49,230
This was a gig
to cover tuition.

132
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:52,230
Maybe so, but, still,
this -- This --

133
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:55,595
This could go
on your permanent record.

134
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:58,291
Unless you hand over
the doctor's research to me --

135
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,167
All of it.

136
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,557
Look, I don't know
what the r.A. Said,

137
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,341
But, uh,
I was growing ferns.

138
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:09,389
Take it easy, phish.
That's not why I'm here.

139
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:10,924
Really?

140
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,031
Oh, thank god.
Okay.

141
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,674
I want to talk to you
about dr. Gregg's sleep study.

142
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,936
Yeah. Dr. Gregg
just died, right?

143
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,341
You were one of
his test subjects, right?

144
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,968
Yeah.

145
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:27,525
Ss you're on duty
or whatever.

146
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,158
I guess
I can make an exception.

147
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:45,358
Now, dr. Gregg
was testing treatments

148
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,388
For a charcot-Wilbrand
syndrome,

149
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:49,436
Which means...

150
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,578
um, I, uh,
I can't dream.

151
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:55,055
I had this bike accident
when I was a kid,

152
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:56,191
And I banged my head
pretty good,

153
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:59,358
And I haven't
had a dream since.

154
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:02,896
Till the study...
uh, sort of.

155
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,777
What'd the doc give you?

156
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,991
It's this yellow tea.

157
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:08,300
It smelled awful --
Tasted worse.

158
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:09,134
What did it do?

159
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,634
Just passed right out.

160
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:15,951
And I had the most vivid,
super-Intense dream.

161
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:17,356
Like a bad acid trip,
you know?

162
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,824
Totally.

163
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,356
I mean, no.

164
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,689
That was it.

165
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,665
I dropped out of his study
right after that.

166
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,951
I didn't...like it.

167
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:31,387
To tell you the truth...
it kind of scared me.

168
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:47,276
How is he?

169
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,228
No change.

170
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:50,419
What you got?

171
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:53,466
Well, considering
what you told me about
the doc's experiments,

172
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,879
Bobby's wall is
starting to make a hell
of a lot more sense.

173
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:56,665
How so?

174
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:58,212
This plant,
silene capensis,

175
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,784
Also known as
african dream root,

176
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,974
It's been used by shamen
and medicine men for centuries.

177
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:05,712
Let me guess -- They dose up,
bust out the didgeridoos,

178
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,165
And start kicking around
the hacky.

179
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,141
Not quite.

180
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:11,482
If you believe the legends,
it's used for dream-Walking.

181
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:13,458
I mean, entering
another person's dreams,

182
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:14,434
Poking around
in their heads.

183
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,053
- I take it we believe the legends.
- When don't we?

184
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:19,268
But dream-Walking is just
the tip of the iceberg.

185
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,791
- What do you mean?
- I mean, this dream root is some serious mojo.

186
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,370
You take enough of it,
with enough practice,

187
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:25,418
You can become
a regular freddy krueger.

188
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:26,491
You can control anything.

189
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,942
You could
turn bad dreams good.

190
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:30,632
You could
turn good dreams bad.

191
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:32,894
And killing people
in their sleep.

192
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,990
For example.

193
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,616
So, let's say this doc

194
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,831
Was testing the stuff on
his patients tim leary-Style.

195
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:40,124
Somebody
gets pissed at him,

196
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:42,258
Decides to give him
a little dream visit,

197
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,358
He goes nighty-Night.

198
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:45,354
But what about Bobby?

199
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,783
I mean, if the killer
came after him,

200
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:49,358
How come
he's still alive?

201
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:51,091
I don't know.

202
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:05,227
Help me!

203
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,091
Somebody help me!

204
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,258
Help me!!

205
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:16,989
So, how do we find
our homicidal little sandman?

206
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:17,822
It could be anyone.

207
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,735
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:18,782 --> 00:11:21,282
Anyone who knew the doctor,
had access to his dream shrooms.

209
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,354
Maybe one of his test subjects
or something?

210
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,425
Possible, but his research
is pretty sketchy.

211
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:29,711
I mean, we don't know
how many subjects he had
or who all of them were.

212
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:31,425
What?

213
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:35,433
In any other case,we'd be calling Bobby And asking him for help right now.

214
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,123
Know what?
You're right.

215
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:39,742
- What?
- Let's go talk to him.

216
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,004
Sure. I think we might
find the conversation
a bit one-Sided.

217
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,076
Not if we're tripping
on some dream root.

218
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,155
- What?
- You heard me.

219
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,031
You want to go dream-Walking
inside Bobby's head?

220
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,036
Yeah, why not?
Maybe we could help.

221
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,822
We have no idea what's
crawling around in there.

222
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:54,298
- How bad could it be?
- Bad.

223
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,464
Dude, it's Bobby.

224
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:00,998
Yeah, you're right.

225
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:04,305
One problem, though.We're fresh out of african dream root.

226
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:07,639
Unless you know someone
who can score some...

227
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:08,782
- Crap.
- What?

228
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,591
Bela.
Bela?

229
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,853
Crap.

230
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,861
You're actually suggesting
we ask her for a favor?

231
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,297
I'm feeling dirty just
thinking about it, but yeah.

232
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,852
Hey, Sam.

233
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,067
Bela.

234
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:45,043
I didn't think there was
a chance in hell you'd show up.

235
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,397
Well,
I'm full of surprises.

236
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:51,924
Though, truthfully,
you want to know why I'm here?

237
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,876
Okay.

238
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,241
Because of you.

239
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,289
Uh, what are you doing?

240
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,955
I can't stop
thinking about you.

241
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,955
What?

242
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:08,097
Are you sure?

243
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:12,249
Sam.

244
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:13,201
Sam.

245
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:14,296
Sam. Oh.

246
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:16,998
Sam, wake up!

247
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:26,256
Dude, you were out.

248
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,304
And making
some serious happy noises.

249
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:29,531
Who were you
dreaming about?

250
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:31,447
- What?
- No one. Nothing.

251
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:33,065
Come on. You can tell me.
Angelina jolie?

252
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:34,065
No.

253
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:35,526
- Brad pitt?
- No!

254
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,907
No.

255
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,031
Dude, it doesn't matter.

256
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:40,145
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

257
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,097
I called Bela.

258
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,130
Bela? Yeah?

259
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:50,164
W-What'd she, you know,
say?

260
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,431
She's...gonna...help us?

261
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,598
Shockingly, no, which puts us
back to square one.

262
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:57,820
I've been trying to decipher
the doctor's notes.

263
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:01,097
<I>Unfortunately, he has
worse handwriting than you do.

264
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:04,731
You gonna come help me
with this stuff?

265
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,531
Yeah, yeah.
Just give me a sec.

266
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,264
Bela,
as I live and breathe.

267
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:29,240
You called me,
remember?

268
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:30,931
I remember
you turning me down.

269
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:33,700
Well, I'm just
full of surprises.

270
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,795
Hey, Bela.
What's going on?

271
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:38,464
I brought you
your african dream root.

272
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:42,128
Nasty stuff.
And not easy to come by.

273
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:43,764
Why the sudden
change of heart?

274
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:46,831
What, I can't do
you a little favor
every now and again?

275
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:49,065
No, you're not.

276
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,331
Now, come on. I want to
know what the strings are
before you attach 'em.

277
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,998
You said this was
for Bobby singer, right?

278
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:58,096
<I>Well, I'm doing it for him,
not you.

279
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,263
Bobby?

280
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:01,168
Why?

281
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:05,598
He saved my life once...
in flagstaff.

282
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:11,771
I screwed up, and he saved me,
okay? Are you satisfied?

283
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:13,937
Maybe.

284
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:16,675
So, when do we go on this little
magical mystery tour?

285
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,342
<I>Oh, you're
not going anywhere.

286
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,031
<I>I don't trust you enough
to let you in my car,

287
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:22,164
Much less Bobby's head.

288
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:23,864
No offense.

289
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:28,183
None taken.

290
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,831
It's 2:00 a.M.
Where am I supposed to go?

291
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,731
Get a room.

292
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:35,635
Oh, they got
the magic fingers,

293
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,183
A little "casa erotica"
on pay-Per-View.

294
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:38,207
You'll love it.

295
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:39,497
You...

296
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,357
nice to -- S-Seeing you...

297
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,786
...Bela.

298
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:55,222
Well,
shall we dim t lights

299
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,794
And sync up "wizard of oz"
and "dark side of the moon"?

300
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,008
Why?

301
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:03,651
What did you do
during college?

302
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:05,831
Wait, wait, wait.
Whew.

303
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,631
Can't forget this.

304
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:11,159
Here.

305
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:12,182
What the hell is that?

306
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,254
Bobby's hair.

307
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:15,664
We have to drink
Bobby's hair?

308
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:17,206
That's how you control
whose dream you're entering.

309
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:20,531
You got to drink
some of their, uh...

310
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,190
some of their body.

311
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,595
Well, guess
the hair of the dog's

312
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,598
<I>Better than
other parts of the body.

313
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:31,397
- Bottoms up.
- Yeah.

314
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:46,531
Feel anything?

315
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:48,944
No.

316
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,164
<I>You feel anything?

317
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,397
No.

318
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,682
Maybe we got
some bad schwag.

319
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:00,467
Hey, when did it
start raining?

320
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,097
<I>When did it start raining
upside down?

321
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,173
Okay, I don't know
what's weirder --

322
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:29,731
The fact
that we're in Bobby's head

323
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:31,831
<I>Or that he's dreaming
of better homes and gardens.

324
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,157
Wait.
Wait a second.

325
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:35,431
Imagine the place
without the paint job,

326
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:40,798
More cluttered, dusty,
books all over the place.

327
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:42,431
It's Bobby's house.

328
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:44,164
Yeah.

329
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,046
Bobby?

330
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:02,196
Bobby?

331
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,744
Dean.

332
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:09,864
I'm gonna go
look outside.

333
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:11,264
No, no, no.
Stay close.

334
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,831
Dude, I'll be fine.
Just look around in here.

335
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:16,109
Look,
we got to find him.

336
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,847
Don't do anything stupid.

337
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,431
Dean!

338
00:18:55,864 --> 00:18:57,564
Dean!

339
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,898
Bobby?

340
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:23,598
Bobby?!

341
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:32,097
Who's out there?

342
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:39,764
Bobby, you in there?

343
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:41,227
Dean?

344
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,097
Yeah, it's me.
Open up.

345
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,536
Hey.

346
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:48,782
How the hell
did you find me?

347
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:51,472
Sam and I got our hands on
some of that dream-Root stuff.

348
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:53,187
Drearoot? What?

349
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:55,306
Dr. Gregg --
The experiments?

350
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,758
What the hell
are you talking about?

351
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:58,901
Hurry.

352
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,130
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.What's going on?
- She's coming.

353
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:03,364
Okay, you know
this is a dream, don't you?

354
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:04,671
W-Whate you crazy?

355
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,885
It's a dream, Bobby.
None of this is real.

356
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:08,998
Does that look made up?

357
00:20:11,197 --> 00:20:12,531
No.

358
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:18,583
Bobby, who is that?

359
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:20,155
She's...

360
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,297
she's my wife.

361
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:47,122
Why, Bobby?

362
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,881
Why did you do this
to me?

363
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:55,247
I'd have rather died myself
than hurt you.

364
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,940
<I>But you did hurt me.

365
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:01,013
You shoved that knife
into me...

366
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:04,247
again and again.

367
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:08,011
You watched me bleed...

368
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,233
watched me die.

369
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:11,924
Bobby, she's not real.

370
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,947
How could you?

371
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,185
You were possessed,
baby.

372
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:18,480
You were rabid.

373
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:20,747
And I didn't know
what I know now.

374
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,614
I didn't know
how to save you.

375
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:26,074
<I>You're lying.
You wanted me dead.

376
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,265
If you'd loved me,
you would have found a way!!

377
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,717
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

378
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:45,248
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

379
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,272
You don't belong here.

380
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,747
You're one to talk.
You're in my friend's head.

381
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,470
Well, you got a poor choice
in friends.

382
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,137
This is self-Defense.
He came after me.
H-He wanted to hurt me.

383
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:56,732
That may be
because you're a killer.

384
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:59,080
You should be nicer
to me.

385
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:02,480
In here,
you're just an insect.

386
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:03,780
I'm a god.

387
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,145
I'm telling you -- All of it,
your house, your wife --

388
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:10,013
It's a nightmare.

389
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,153
I killed her.
Boby

390
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,676
This is a dream and you can wake up.

391
00:22:17,724 --> 00:22:19,391
<I>Hell,
you can do anything.

392
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:22,462
Just leave me alone.
Let her kill me already.

393
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,747
Look at me.
Look at me.

394
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:24,938
You got to
snap out of this now.

395
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,514
You got to
snap out of this now!

396
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:28,034
You're not gonna die.
I'm not gonna let you die.

397
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,814
I'm not gonna let nnu die.
You're like a father to me.

398
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:33,747
You've got to believe me.Please!

399
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:39,041
I'm dreaming?

400
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:41,763
Yes!
Now, take control of it!

401
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,057
I don't believe it.

402
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:09,342
Believe it.

403
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,707
Now,
would you please wake up?

404
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:13,326
Sweet dreams.

405
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:32,191
Hey, Bobby...

406
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:37,389
that, uh, that stuff --
All that stuff with your wife...

407
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:41,556
...that actually happen?

408
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:47,080
<I>Everybody got into hunting
somehow.

409
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:48,913
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,659
Don't be sorry.

411
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:52,968
If it weren't for you,
I'd still be lost in there...

412
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,111
or dead.

413
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:59,302
Thank you.

414
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,500
So, uh, stoner boy
wasn't in his dorm.

415
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,238
My guess is
he's long gone by now.

416
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:11,643
He ain't
much of a stoner.

417
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,405
- No?
- No.

418
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,690
His name's jeremy frost --
Full-On genius -- 160 I.Q.

419
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:18,976
Which is saying something,

420
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,103
Considering his dad took
a baseball bat to his head.

421
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:25,198
Here's
father of the year.

422
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:26,841
He died
before jeremy was 10.

423
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:27,889
Looks like
a real sweetheart.

424
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:29,984
Injury gave him
charcot-Wilbrand.

425
00:24:30,008 --> 00:24:31,222
He hasn't dreamt since.

426
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,246
Till he started
dosing the dream drug.
Yep.

427
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,722
yep.

428
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:37,777
How did he know how to
dig up your worst nightmare
and throw it at you?

429
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:39,539
Hey, he was rooting around
in my skull.

430
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,920
God knows
what he saw in there.

431
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:42,563
Yeah, how'd he get in there
in the first place?

432
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:44,539
Isn't he supposed to
have some of your hair,
your dna, or something?

433
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,611
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

434
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,904
Before I knew it was him,
he offered me a beer.

435
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:51,809
I drank it.

436
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,095
Dumbest friggin' thing.

437
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,190
Oh, I don't know.
It wasn't that dumb.

438
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,071
Dean, you didn't.

439
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:00,840
I was thirsty.

440
00:25:00,888 --> 00:25:02,959
That's great. Now he can
come after either one of you.

441
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:05,126
<I>Well, now we just have to
find him first.

442
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,983
We better work fast...
and coffee up.

443
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,840
<I>'Cause the one thing
we cannot do is fall asleep.

444
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:15,174
Two days later.

445
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,491
I mean, this jeremy guy's
not a friggin' ghost.

446
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:21,300
Where the hell
could he be?

447
00:25:21,324 --> 00:25:22,420
Dean, you sure
you don't want me to drive?

448
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,634
You -- You seem
a little...caffeinated.

449
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:27,396
Well, thanks for
the news flash, edison!

450
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:31,927
Jeez.

451
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:33,118
Tell me
you got something!

452
00:25:33,142 --> 00:25:36,213
- The strip club was a bust, huh?
- Yeah.

453
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:37,784
That was our last lead.

454
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:38,935
What the hell, Bobby?!

455
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,387
Don't yell at me, boy.

456
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:42,530
- I'm working my ass off here.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

457
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:43,768
I'm just --
I'm -- I'm tired.

458
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,744
Well, who ain't?

459
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:46,483
What's Bela got?

460
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:48,697
What do you got, Bela?
Sorry.

461
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,673
Sometimes the spirit world's
in a chatty mood,

462
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:52,316
And sometimes it isn't.

463
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,649
- She's got nothing.
- Great!

464
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:57,609
Well, I'm just gonna go
blow my brains out now!

465
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,252
Gosh!

466
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:07,347
Let me ask you something.

467
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:10,166
What are you doing
helping us?

468
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,022
Bobby, I'm surprised
you don't remember.

469
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:16,450
Flagstaff?

470
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:18,831
Oh.

471
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:20,267
Yeah.

472
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,617
Right.

473
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,000
Flagstaff.

474
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:43,799
All right, that's it.
I'm done.

475
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:45,371
What are you doing?

476
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:47,037
Taking myself
a long-Overdue nap.

477
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:48,966
What? Dean,
jeremy can come after you.

478
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:50,066
That's the idea.

479
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,037
Excuse me?

480
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:53,521
<I>Co on, man. We can't find him,
so let him come to me.

481
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,926
On his own turf --
Where he's basically a god?

482
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,188
I can handle it.

483
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:59,432
Not alone you can't.

484
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:00,807
Ow!

485
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:02,093
What are you doing?

486
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Coming in with you.

487
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,066
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

488
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,719
At least then,
it'll be two against one.

489
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,900
'Cause I don't want you
digging around in my head.

490
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:13,338
Too bad.

491
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:28,846
Dean.

492
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:34,020
For the love of god.

493
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,735
What are we
still doing here?

494
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,425
I have no idea.

495
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:45,306
There's someone
out there.

496
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:05,267
* stars shining bright
above you *

497
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,866
* night breezes
seem to whisper "I love you" *

498
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,607
Hey.

499
00:28:11,631 --> 00:28:13,774
You gonna sit down?

500
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:16,496
Come on.

501
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,367
We only have an hour

502
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:20,766
Before we have to pick ben up
from baseball.

503
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,139
* say nighty-Night and kiss me

504
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,123
I've never had this dream
before.

505
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:31,066
* just hold me tight
and tell me you'll miss me *

506
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,194
Stop looking at me
like that.

507
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:34,908
Sorry.

508
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:36,528
Dean.

509
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:40,432
I love you.

510
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,250
Where'd she go?

511
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,178
Dean.

512
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,051
Okay.

513
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:34,868
Dean?

514
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:06,701
Jeremy?

515
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:24,780
Hey, Dean.

516
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:33,621
Well, aren't you
a handsome son of a gun.

517
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:35,549
We need to talk.

518
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:37,608
I get it. I get it.

519
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:39,645
I'm my own
worst nightmare.

520
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:41,264
That it? Huh?

521
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:43,216
Like the "superman iii"
junkyard scene --

522
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:45,771
A little mano y mano
with myself?

523
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,574
Joke all you want,
smartass.

524
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,128
<I>But you can't lie to me.

525
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:53,248
I know the truth.

526
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:55,628
I know how dead you are
inside...

527
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:57,962
how worthless
you feel.

528
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:01,565
I know how
you look into a mirror...

529
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:04,446
and hate what you see.

530
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:09,075
Sorry, pal.
It's not gonna work.

531
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:10,112
You're not real.

532
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,446
Sure I am.

533
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,168
I'm you.

534
00:31:13,215 --> 00:31:15,715
I don't think so.

535
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:18,239
<I>'Cause, see,
this is my siesta...

536
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:19,715
not yours.

537
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:23,668
All I got to do is snap
my fingers, and you go bye-Bye.

538
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:36,914
I'm not going anywhere.

539
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,794
Neither are you.

540
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:45,540
Like I said...

541
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:46,564
we need to talk.

542
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:52,326
Dean.

543
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:54,310
Hey.

544
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:56,858
Wake up.

545
00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:06,294
Boy, you just don't know
When to leave well enough
alone, do you?

546
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:07,441
You're a psycho.

547
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:08,699
- You're wrong.
- Yeah?

548
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:10,675
Tell that to dr. Gregg.

549
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,408
The doc?

550
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:14,770
No, no, the doc's the one
who got me hooked on this stuff,

551
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:16,841
And then he took it away.

552
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:18,274
But I needed it,

553
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:20,142
And he wouldn't
let me have it.

554
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:21,708
So you killed him.

555
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:23,941
I can dream again.

556
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,754
You know what that's like --
Not to be able to dream?

557
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:29,325
Y-You never rest --
Not really.

558
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:32,397
I-It's like being awake
for 15 years.

559
00:32:32,444 --> 00:32:34,754
And let me guess --
That makes you go crazy.

560
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:37,904
I just want
to be left alone.

561
00:32:37,928 --> 00:32:40,071
I just want to dream.

562
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,508
Sorry.

563
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,008
Can't do that.

564
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:45,143
That's the wrong answer.

565
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:59,307
I'm getting better and better
at this --

566
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:02,587
Stronger and stronger
all the time.

567
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,174
But you
and your brother...

568
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,708
you're not waking up...

569
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:10,944
not this time.

570
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,348
I'm not gonna let you.

571
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:14,008
I mean,
you're going to hell,

572
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,896
And you won't lift a finger
to stop it.

573
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:18,404
Talk about low self-Esteem.

574
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:21,285
Then, again, I guess
it's not much of a life
worth saving, now, is it?

575
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,356
Come on, Dean.
Come on. Wake up.

576
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:26,309
I mean after all you got nothing outside the Sam.

577
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:27,875
<I>You are nothing.

578
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,441
You're as mindless and obedient
as an attack dog.

579
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:33,441
- That's not true.
- No?

580
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:36,745
What are the things
that you want?

581
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:39,507
What are the things
that you dream?

582
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,126
I mean, your car --
That's dad's.

583
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,967
Your favorite
leather jacket -- Dad's.

584
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:45,824
Your music -- Dad's.

585
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:49,205
<I>Do you even have
an original thought?

586
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:50,324
No.

587
00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:52,467
No, all there is
is "watch out for Sammy.

588
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:55,943
Look after
your little brother, boy."

589
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:59,117
You can still hear your dad's
voice in your head, can't you?

590
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:00,046
Clear as a bell.

591
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:02,022
Just shut up.

592
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:05,427
I mean, think about it.

593
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:08,165
All he ever d
was train you...

594
00:34:08,189 --> 00:34:10,594
boss you around.

595
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,435
But Sam...

596
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,839
Sam, he doted on.

597
00:34:14,863 --> 00:34:15,816
Sam, he loved.

598
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,792
I mean it.
I'm getting angry.

599
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:20,554
Dad knew
who you really were --

600
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:23,935
A good soldier
and nothing else.

601
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,752
Daddy's
blunt little instrument.

602
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:29,300
Your own father didn't care
whether you lived or died.

603
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:32,657
- Why should you?
- You son of a bitch!

604
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,252
My father
was an obsessed bastard!

605
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:41,474
All that crap he dumped on me
about protecting Sam --

606
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:42,712
<I>That was his crap!

607
00:34:42,736 --> 00:34:45,783
<I>He's thalone who couldn
protect his family!

608
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,522
He's the one
who let mom die!

609
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,053
<I>Who wasn't there for Sam!
I always was!

610
00:34:51,077 --> 00:34:52,005
It wasn't fair!

611
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:53,910
I didn't deserve
what he put on me!

612
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:56,077
And I don't deserve
to go to hell!

613
00:35:23,402 --> 00:35:26,341
You can't escape me, Dean.
You're gonna die.

614
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,211
<I>And this -- This is
what you're gonna become.

615
00:35:30,235 --> 00:35:33,045
You can't stop me.

616
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:35,171
There's nothing
I can't do in here.

617
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:36,648
Because of
the dream root.

618
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:37,886
That's right.

619
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:40,910
Yeah? Well,
you're forgetting something.

620
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:43,695
What's tha

621
00:35:44,814 --> 00:35:47,536
I took the dream root,
too.

622
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,965
Jeremy?!

623
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,322
Jeremy!

624
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,703
No.

625
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:55,917
No.

626
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:56,679
Dad?

627
00:35:56,703 --> 00:35:59,560
You answer me
when I'm talking to you, boy!

628
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:28,631
You did a little dream-Weaving
of your own in there, huh?

629
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,726
Yeah, uh, I just
sort of concentrated,

630
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:32,287
And it happened,
you know?

631
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:34,821
Didn't have anything
to do with...

632
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:38,607
you know,
your psychic stuff?

633
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:43,686
No.

634
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,567
I mean,
I don't think so.

635
00:36:47,162 --> 00:36:48,115
Good.

636
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,758
Good.

637
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:57,908
Hey,
you guys seen Bela?

638
00:36:57,932 --> 00:37:00,551
She's not in her room.
She's not answering her phone.

639
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:03,384
She must have taken off
or something.

640
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:04,646
Just like that?
That's a little weird.

641
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,170
Well, if you ask me what's
weird, it's why she helped
us in the first place.

642
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:10,344
I thought
you saved her life.

643
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,464
What the hell
are you talking about?

644
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:15,392
The thing flagstaff.

645
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:18,273
That thing in flagstaff
was an amulet.

646
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:21,178
I gave her a good deal.
That's all.

647
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,662
Well, then, why did --

648
00:37:24,686 --> 00:37:28,162
You boys better check
your pockets.

649
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:30,328
??

650
00:37:33,638 --> 00:37:35,520
No, no, no, no, no, no.

651
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,646
The colt.

652
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,146
Bela stole the colt.

653
00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:43,908
Damn it, boys!

654
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,622
Pack your crap.

655
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,122
Why?
Where are we going?

656
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:50,050
We're gonna go
hunt the bitch down.

657
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:55,368
Hey, Sam,
I was wondering --

658
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:57,320
When you were in my head,
what did you see?

659
00:37:57,344 --> 00:38:00,796
Uh, just jeremy.
He kept me separated from you.

660
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,772
Easier to beat my brains out
that way, I guess.

661
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:06,256
What about you?
You never said.

662
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,253
<I>Nothing. I was looking for you
the whole time.

663
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:18,883
Sam...

664
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:20,335
yeah?

665
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:23,835
I've been doing
some thinking.

666
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:26,554
And...

667
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,121
well, the thing is...

668
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:35,296
...I don't want to die.

669
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:40,724
I don't want
to go to hell.

670
00:38:43,962 --> 00:38:46,398
All right, yeah.

671
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:49,732
We'll find a way
to save you.

672
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,041
Okay, good.

673
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,446
You n't escape me, Dean.

674
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,001
You're gonna die.

675
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:01,835
<I>And this -- This is
what you're gonna become.
