Did you check out
that barker farm?

183
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:47,976
It's a bust.
A bunch of hippie freaks.

184
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,375
Though they could kill
with that patchouli smell alone.

185
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:51,576
Where's the nest, then?

186
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:56,043
I got this one covered.

187
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:57,275
Look, don't get me wrong.

188
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:58,876
It's a pleasure
meeting you fellas,

189
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,242
but I've been on this thing
for over a year.

190
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:03,043
I killed a fang
back in Austin,

191
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:04,576

all the way up here.

192
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:06,075
I'll finish it.

193

We could help.

194
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:11,342
Thanks, but, uh, I'm kind of
a go-it-alone type of guy.

195

I've been itching
for a hunt.
Sorry.

But, hey, i hear there's
a chupacabra two States over.

197

Go ahead
and knock yourselves out.

198
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:27,009
It was real good meeting you,
though.

199
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:29,342
I'll buy you a drink

You gave that big-ass fang one

trying to tell him.

You could learn a thing or two
from this guy.

bring you guys down.

that way sometimes.

I'm sitting there,
and I'm looking into the fire,

250
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,476

"I'm 16 years old.

"Kids my age are worried
about pimples, prom dates.

that they'll never even know,

How'd you get started?

261
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:01,877
First time i saw a vampire,
i was barely 18.

262
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,777
Home alone with my sister.

263
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,977
I hear the window break
in her room.

264
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,010
I grabbed my dad's gun, run in,
try to get it off her.

265
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,576
It was too late.

266
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,443
So i shoot the damn thing,

267
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:16,144
which, of course,
is about as useful

268
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:17,777
as snapping it
with a rubber band.

269
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,643
It rushes me, picks me up,

270
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,810
flings me across the room,
knocks me out cold.

271
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:24,977

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,276

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,343
Then...

to your family.

how you kill them.

You're telling me you're
responsible for all the --

358
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,301
it's not ideal.
In fact, it's disgusting.

359
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,134
But it allows us
to get by.

360
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,733
Okay. Uh, why?

361
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,167
Survival.

362
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,134
No deaths, no missing locals,

363
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,401
no reason for people like you to
come looking for people like us.

364
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:45,434
And we blend in.

365
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:48,301
Our kind
is practically extinct.

366
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,501
It turns out,

367
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:52,101
we weren't as High up
the food chain as we imagined.

368
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:55,034
Why are we explaining ourselves
to this killer?
Eli.

369
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,733
We choke on cow's blood
so that none of them suffer.

370
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:00,167
Tonight, they murdered Conrad,
and they celebrated.

371
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:01,767
Eli, that's enough.

372
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,101
Yeah, eli, that's enough.

373
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:05,967
What's done is done.

374
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,434
We're leaving
this town tonight.

375
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:10,434
Then, why did you bring me here?
Why are you even talking to me?

376
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:12,101
Believe me, I'd rather not.

377
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:13,434
But i know your kind.

378
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,600
Once you have the scent,
you'll keep tracking us.

379
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:17,034
It doesn't matter
where we go.

380
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,568
Hunters will find us.

381
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,334
So you're asking us
not to follow you.

382
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,733
We have a right to live.
We're not hurting anyone.

383
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,101
Right, so you keep saying.

384
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:26,501
But give me one good reason
why i should believe you.

385
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,034
Fine.

386
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:33,967
You know
what I'm going to do?

387
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:39,134
I'm going to let you go.

388
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:42,867
Take him back.

389
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,967
Not a mark on him.

390
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:07,934
[ engine turns over ]

391
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:17,267
This is the best pattern
i can establish.

392
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:18,967
It's sketchy, at best.

393
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,967
Looks like it's all coming
from this side of town,

394
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,267
which means the nest would be
around here someplace, right?

395
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:24,568
Yep,
that's what I'm thinking.

396
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,501
Problem is,
there's 35, 40 farms out there.

397
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:31,101
I searched about half of them
already but nothing yet.

398
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:33,934
They're covering their tracks
real good.

399
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:36,134
I guess we'll just
have to search the other half.

400
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:41,401
What time is it?
Where is Sam?

401
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:43,034
Car's parked outside.

402
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:44,934
Probably went for a walk.

403
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,501
Seems like
the take-a-walk type.

404
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:48,967
Yeah, he is, but...

405
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:53,334
Where you been?

406
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,534
Can i talk to you alone?

407
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:59,034
You mind chilling out
for a couple of minutes?

408
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:05,434
Dean, maybe we got to rethink
this hunt.

409
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:06,900
What are you
talking about?

410
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,000
Where were you?

411
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,600
[ sighs ]

412
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,067
In the nest.

413
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,201
You found it?

414
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:13,534
They found me, man.

415
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:14,900
How did you get out?

416
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:17,134
How many did you kill?

417
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,568
None.

418
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,067
Sam,
they didn't just let you go.

419
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:21,434
That's exactly
what they did.

420
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:22,934
All right,
well, where is it?

421
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:26,267
I was blindfolded.
I don't know.
You got to know something.

422
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:29,234
We went over that bridge
outside of town, but we
shouldn't go after them.

423
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:31,468
Why not?
I don't think
they're like other vampires.

424
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:32,800
I don't think
they're killing people.

425
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:33,867
You're joking.

426
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:37,201
Then, how do they stay alive
or undead

427
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:38,800
or whatever the hell
they are?

428
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:39,934
The cattle mutilations.

429
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,834
They said they live
off of animal blood.

430
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,000
And you believed them?

431
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,501
Look at me, Dean.

432
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:47,334
They let me go
without a scratch.

433
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:49,633
Wait, so you're saying --

434
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,101
no, man. No way.

435
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:54,468
I don't know why they
let you go. I don't really care.

436
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:56,501
We find them,
and we waste them.

437
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:58,633
Why?

438
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,334
What part of vampires
don't you understand, Sam?

439
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:04,000
If it's supernatural,
we kill it. That's our job.

440
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:06,367
No, Dean, that is not our job.
Our job is hunting evil.

441
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:08,234
And if these things
aren't killing people,

442
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,468
they're not evil.

443
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:11,934
Of course, they're killing
people. That's what they do.

444
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:14,101
They're all the same, Sam.
They're not human, okay?

445
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,234
We have to exterminate
every last one of them.

446
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,633
No, Dean, i don't think so,
all right? Not this time.

447
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,767
Gordon's been on those vamps
for a year. He knows.

448
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,201
Gordon? You're taking
his word for it?

449
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:25,267
That's right.
Ellen says he's bad news.

450
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:26,667
You called Ellen?

451
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,167
And I'm supposed
to listen to her?

452
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,967
We barely know her, Sam.
No thanks. I'll go with Gordon.

453
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,600
Right, 'cause Gordon's
such an old friend.

454
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:35,834
You don't think i can see
what this is?

455
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,201
What are you talking about?

456
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:38,867
He's a substitute for dad.
A poor one.

457
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,101
Shut up, Sam.

458
00:27:40,134 --> 00:27:42,667
He's not even close, Dean,
not on his best day.

459
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,800
You slap on this fake smile,
but i can see right through it

460
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,534
'cause i know how you feel,
Dean.

461
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:49,201
Dad's dead.

462
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,067
And he left a hole, and it hurts
so bad you can't take it.

463
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:55,101
But you can't just fill up that
hole with whoever you want to.

464
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:57,201
It's an insult to his memory.

465
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:00,534
Okay.

466
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,900
You can hit me all you want.

467
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,301
It won't change anything.

468
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:15,633
I'm going to that nest.

469
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,800
You don't want to tell me
where it is. Fine.

470
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,667
I'll find it myself.

471
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,900
Dean.

472
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:29,834
Gordon?

473
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,434
You think
he went after them?

474
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:34,434
Probably.

475
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:35,900
Dean,
we have to stop him.

476
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:37,501
Really?
'Cause i say we lend a hand.

477
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:39,767
Just give me the benefit
of the doubt, would you?

478
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
You owe me that.

479
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:42,234
Yeah, we'll see.

480
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,134
I'll drive.
Give me the keys.

481
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,401
He snaked the keys.

[ engine sputters ]
I can't believe this.

483
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,767
I just fixed her up, too.

485
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:00,167
So, the bridge,
is that all you got?

486
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:03,234
The bridge was 4 1/2 minutes
from their farm.

487
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:05,234
How do you know?

488
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:06,401
I counted.

489
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:10,101
Took a left
out of the farm,

490
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:12,667
then turned right
onto a dirt road,

491
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,934
followed that
for two minutes slightly uphill

492
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:17,301
then took another quick right,
and we hit the bridge.

493
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,301
You're good.

494
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:21,534
You're a monster
pain in the ass...

495
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:24,867
...but you're good.

496
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,800
In the truck, thank you.

497
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,334
We can't leave like this.

498
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:42,134
Lenore, listen to me.

499
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,267
We need to stay and fight.

500
00:29:44,301 --> 00:29:46,568
They were my friends, too, eli,
my family.

501
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,501
That's not
what I'm talking about.

502
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:50,733
This is self-defense --
kill or be killed.

503
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,800
They can't hunt us
if they're dead.

504
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,468
Killing those three
wouldn't solve anything.

505
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,600
There's more
where they came from.

506
00:29:57,633 --> 00:29:59,501
We're outnumbered.

507
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:02,167
This...this is all we can do.

508
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,934
Try and reason --

509
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:06,234
you can't reason
with these people.

510
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:08,434
They're gonna
kill us all anyway.

511
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:11,301
We should at least take
a few of them with us.

512
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:18,234
I'm not giving up hope.

513
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:22,201
If we can change,
they can change.

514
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:25,101
Now, go into town
and gather the others.

515
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:27,101
We leave before sunrise.

516
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,434
Dead man's blood, bitch.

517
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:37,226
Sam, Dean, come on in.

518
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:38,959
Gordon, what's going on?

519
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:41,393
Just poisoning lenore here
with some dead man's blood.

520
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,326
She's gonna tell us where
all her friends are, aren't you?

521
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,326
Want to help?

522
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,959
Look, man --
grab a knife.

523
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:49,992
I was just about to start in
on the fingers.

524
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:59,959
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey,
let's all just chill out, huh?

525
00:32:59,992 --> 00:33:02,460
I'm completely chill.
Gordon,
put the knife down.

526
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:05,126
It sounds like
it's Sam here needs to chill.

527
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,526
Just step away from her,
all right?

528
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,859
You're right.

529
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,393
I'm wasting my time here.

530
00:33:17,426 --> 00:33:20,059
This bitch will never talk.

531
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:22,659
Might as well put her
out of her misery.

532
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:26,826
I just sharpened it,
so it's completely humane.

533
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:28,259
Gordon,
I'm letting her go.

534
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:30,692
You're not doing
a damn thing.

535
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:31,859
Dean: Hey, hey.

536
00:33:31,892 --> 00:33:33,426
Gordon,
let's talk about this.

537
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,226
Gordon:
What's there to talk about?

538
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:37,926
It's like i said, Dean --
no shades of Gray.

539
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,926
Yeah, i hear you.

540
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:42,359
And i know how you feel.
Do you?

541
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:45,059
The vampire that killed your
sister deserved to die, but --

[ chuckles ]

543
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:49,059
Killed my sister.

544
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,093
That filthy fang
didn't kill my sister.

545
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:54,625
It turned her,
made her one of them.

546
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:58,892
So i hunted her down,
and i killed her myself.

547
00:33:58,926 --> 00:34:00,859
You did what?

548
00:34:00,892 --> 00:34:03,059
It wasn't my sister anymore.
It wasn't human.

549
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,359
I didn't blink.

550
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:06,560
And neither would you.

551
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:08,426
Sam:
So you knew all along, then.

552
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,193
You knew the vampires
weren't killing anyone.

553
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:14,193
You knew about the cattle,
and you just didn't care.

554
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:15,826
Gordon:
Care about what?

555
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:18,259
A nest of vampires
suddenly acting nice,

556
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:20,659
taking a little time out
from sucking innocent people,

557
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,625
and we're supposed
to buy that?

558
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,859
Trust me.

559
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:27,625
It doesn't change
what they are.

560
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,692
And i can prove it.

[ gun cocks ]

562
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:35,059
Let him go.

563
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:38,526
Now!

564
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,625
Relax.

565
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,926
If i wanted to kill him,
he'd be on the floor.

566
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:44,259
Just making a point.

Still want to save her?
Look at her.

573

They're all the same --
evil, bloodthirsty.

574
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,126
No.

575
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,226
No.

00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:26,725
You hear her, Gordon?

No.

We're done here.

580
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:40,159
Sam, get her out of here.
Yeah.

Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

Gordon, i think you and i
got some things to talk about.

You're not serious.

586
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:14,659
I'm having a hard time
believing it, too,

587
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:16,026
but i know what i saw.

588
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:18,293
If you want those vampires,
you got to go through me.

Fine.

You doing this for a fang?

Come on, Dean,
we're on the same side here.

I don't think so,
you sadistic bastard.

You're not

is done.

went on, Sammy, our whole lives.

Okay.
What if we killed things
that didn't deserve killing?

639
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:28,316
You know?
I mean, the way dad raised us.

00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,183
Dean,
after what happened to mom...

641
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,516
...dad did the best he could.

I know he did.

But maybe he wasn't perfect.

644
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:40,916
And the way he raised us,
to hate those things --

645
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:42,049
and, man, i hate them.

646
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,049

I was gonna kill them all.
