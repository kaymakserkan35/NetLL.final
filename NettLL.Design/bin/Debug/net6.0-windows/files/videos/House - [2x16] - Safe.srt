1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:09,981
It's almost 11:00.

2
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:12,197
She needs a lot of sleepthese days.

3
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:14,610
Please, Mrs. Bardach.

4
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,288
I haven't seen her for a week.

5
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:19,899
I'll see how she's feeling.

6
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:22,344
- Thank you.
- You know what to do.

7
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:38,040
Bardach: All done?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:41,195
I, uh, scrubbed
for 45 seconds,

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,719
did the nails,
all the way downthe elbows,

10
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:45,747
the whole deal.

11
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:47,263
[Sneezes]

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,796
- Are you sick?
- No, no, no.

13
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:51,034
- Cough, sore throat?
- No, no.

14
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,857
I just--Sometimes I sneeze
when I look at lights.

15
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:55,072
I always have.

16
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:55,910
I'm sorry. You better--

17
00:00:55,994 --> 00:00:58,356
I would never get her sick.

18
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:00,114
Please.

19
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:07,878
A mask.

20
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:09,523
Got me by the bouncer.

21
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:13,140
She's crazy.
She's let me out like six times
in the last two months.

22
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,746
Every time it's just
to go to the hospital.
I'm a prisoner.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,357
Aw, it's okay.

24
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:26,175
- It's ugly.
- No.

25
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:32,555
I wasn't looking
at the scar anyways.

26
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:39,369
Take off your mask.

27
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:44,410
Uh...If your mom
comes in here, she--

28
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:47,923
Hey, give me a kiss
or I'll kill you.

29
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:56,817
Your skin.

30
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,677
Are you okay?

31
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,217
[Wheezes]

32
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:04,318
Augh.

33
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,398
Melinda, can you--

34
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:13,525
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Can you breathe?

35
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:16,895
What's wrong?
Is it your heart?

36
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:18,384
What's wrong?

37
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:20,633
Mrs. Bardach!

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,661
Melinda, I don't know how to use this.
I've never used one of these before.

39
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:32,348
[Choking]

40
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,908
[Catches her wind]

41
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,423
What did you do to her?

42
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:53,964
2X16 - Safe

43
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,521
Original Airdate (FOX): 4 APR-2006

44
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,977
Cuddy called.

45
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,754
I know.
Saw the caller ID.

46
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:57,298
Young girl,
anaphylactic shock.

47
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:58,952
You answered?

48
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,906
Turns out that's
what stops the ringing.

49
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,241
It's a weird case.

50
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,933
I thought you did
the dishes last night.

51
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:10,147
It was your day.

52
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,146
I did. Those are new.

53
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,748
Midnight snack.

54
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,991
For a midnight snack,
you made a pot roast.

55
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:19,397
The same pot roast
I made last night.

56
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:22,837
Yeah. Actually,
it was after midnight.

57
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,270
Today is your day, right?

58
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,751
You want me out of here.
I get it.

59
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:29,390
No, it's fine if you stay.

60
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,982
The place I was gonna move,
the guy never called.

61
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:34,757
- Otherwise, I'll already be there.
- I said it's fine if you stay.

62
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,899
Yeah. That's why you're
making me miserable.

63
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:40,022
Maybe I just want to make sure
you do your fair share around here.

64
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,004
Tha--

65
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:42,498
What's weird about it?

66
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:47,242
The girl with the allergies.

67
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,412
Yeah.

68
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:51,467
- She's immunocompromised.
- What are you doing?

69
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,692
What? You asked me--

70
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:54,308
You knew that I was interested.

71
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,017
That gives you
a valuable bargaining chip.

72
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,754
You could've had me
doing dishes for a week.

73
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,956
Okay.

74
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:11,609
The allergic reaction happened
while she was in a clean room.

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,274
Why does she have
a clean room in her home?

76
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:24,761
Heart transplant.
Immune system's in the toilet.

77
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:28,671
Mommy builds her little angel
a John Travolta-quality bubble.

78
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:32,169
Six months after the transplant,
she doesn't need to be
confined to a clean room.

79
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:36,150
Six months without putting out,
Dr. Cuddy doesn't need
to wear thong panties, but

80
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,380
it's not our call.

81
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:39,643
I was wondering when
you'd get around to my panties.

82
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,703
She's had four days of workups.

83
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:45,094
They've tested everyone who
came anywhere near that room,
everything in the room.

84
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,130
It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.

85
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,648
Maybe it's not what was there.
It's what she was doing.

86
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:52,323
Exercise allergy.
Love it.

87
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:58,524
What sort of exercise could
a strapping young man and
a nubile teenage nymphet possibly--

88
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,785
Mom  was in the room
within seconds.

89
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,981
So the boyfriend brought in
an allergen and is lying about it.

90
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:05,702
Or the girl snuck out and
she's lying about that.

91
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:08,471
Or the parents are lying
about the room being clean.

92
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,409
These are your big ideas?

93
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,747
Somebody's lying?

94
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:13,426
Hasn't let me down yet.

95
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:17,455
Recheck Mom, Dad, the girl,
the boy, the room, and the home.

96
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,527
Any of you have a new soap,
detergent, perfume?

97
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,128
No. Barbara's really
careful about that stuff.

98
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:30,068
And you haven't been
outside recently?

99
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:32,183
How could I?
I'm trapped up there.

100
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,482
You're not trapped.
It's just safe--

101
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:35,319
They won't even
tell me the alarm code.

102
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,448
Just tell her I can
go back to school.

103
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:38,824
Till we clear this up.

104
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:39,720
Fine.

105
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:42,541
Find out what I'm allergic to,
and I'll stay away from it.

106
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:46,692
Then I can go back to school, right?

107
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:49,400
It's up to your parents.

108
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,490
But medically,
there's no reason--

109
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,874
Told you.

110
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:55,606
Could I speak to you outside
for a second, please?

111
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:03,504
You know, this is hard enough
without you in there giving--

112
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:04,223
She asked my opinion.

113
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,559
She is 16 years old.
Lie to her.

114
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:08,976
When I was eight,
my mom, she hated--

115
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:10,974
I know.
I-I need to loosen up.

116
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,677
I'm overprotective.
I saw Finding Nemo. I get it.

117
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:14,955
I don't need another story.

118
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:16,590
But you're not just
being overprotective.

119
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:18,601
You're  one of the most
overprotective parents
I've ever seen.

120
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,722
She has the best private tutors.

121
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:23,658
I let her friends visit.
I'm not going to apologize.

122
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,477
Just  giving you my thoughts.

123
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,472
She almost died three times
during her childhood.

124
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,792
Penicillin,
bee stings, peanuts.

125
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:31,550
I've seen her file.

126
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:35,116
Six month ago,
we leave her home alone
for the first time on a weekend.

127
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,686
She goes out,
buys one chocolate chip cookie.

128
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,182
Peanut butter in the dough.

129
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:43,853
She's forgotten her epi pen,
she drives to the hospital,
passes out, has an accident.

130
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,116
Steering wheel
crushed her chest.

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,996
She ended up losing her heart.

132
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:51,099
So when you say to me

133
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:55,344
that I'm one of the most
overprotective parents
you've seen, please...

134
00:07:56,078 --> 00:08:00,526
please introduce me to the ones
who were more protective

135
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:03,256
so that I can find out
what they're doing right.

136
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:13,475
She's allergic to having
a sucky social life.

137
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,567
Give the parents a break.
They're just trying
to keep her healthy.

138
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:18,587
Everything in here's
labeled "hypoallergenic."

139
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:19,894
Check it anyway.

140
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:24,787
Cameron.

141
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:29,815
This place is cleaner
than her hospital room.

142
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:33,213
No alarm on this window.

143
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:34,717
It's 20-foot drop.

144
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,325
You can get to the tree from here.
There's some bark scraped off.

145
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:40,491
Sure. Heart-transplant girl
swung down there on a vine.

146
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,612
Maybe she was hooking up
with Tarzan and Cheetah
down by the elephant graveyard.

147
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:48,665
Or...Jane stayed in the tree house
and Tarzan came up.

148
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:55,871
Okay. Um, I spent
most of the night Friday.

149
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:59,471
But if her mom finds out
about that, she will totally freak.

150
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:00,776
You guys had sex?

151
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:05,490
Yeah, but, you know,
I did everything I could
to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

152
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:06,832
A latex allergy?

153
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:09,168
What do you mean,
like a condom? We didn't--

154
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:10,370
You had unsafe sex?

155
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:12,250
The whole unsafe thing
didn't tell you something?

156
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:16,038
Yeah, but we didn't like
plan on it, you know? It just--

157
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,679
I don't know. We're in love.
We've been dating for two years.

158
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:19,937
Practically a lifetime.

159
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,814
How about a semen allergy?

160
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,497
We're gonna need
a semen sample.

161
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:28,035
You can use
the bathroom over there.

162
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,445
Right. Uh, how do I...

163
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,017
Aim and shoot.

164
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:36,802
No thinking about Dr. Cameron.
We'll know.

165
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:39,574
We should tell her parents.

166
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,176
Why stop there?
Call the cops.

167
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,169
Melinda's a minor.

168
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:46,133
And if we nip it in the bud here,
teenagers will never again have sex.

169
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,065
The parents will find out
when they get the bill anyway.

170
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,688
Oh, so you're fine with them
finding out as long as you don't
have to tell them personally?

171
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:51,641
Pretty much.

172
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:58,124
Too bad it's not you
giving the sample.

173
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,698
We'd be done by now.

174
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,695
Test was negative.
No semen allergy.

175
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:09,073
Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak
on the night before the anaphylaxis.

176
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:10,483
I don't buy that it's unrelated.

177
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,511
He loves her.
Did everything he could
to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

178
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,362
What does that mean?

179
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,878
Love is an emotion
certain people experience,
similar to happiness.

180
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:21,705
No. Maybe I should give
a more relatable example.

181
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,505
Oh, snap!

182
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,053
What did he do to protect her?

183
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:27,758
Brillo-pad his privates?

184
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,073
- I assumed he washed and he--
- Oh, good work.

185
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,120
Assumptions are so much
faster than actual questions.

186
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:44,163
House:
You the boyfriend?

187
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:46,439
Need to borrow you.

188
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,106
What is going on?

189
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:51,624
Don't worry. I'll return him
in roughly the same condition.

190
00:10:58,446 --> 00:10:59,909
Do you take anything
to stay healthy?

191
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:02,144
Something stronger
than an apple a day?

192
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:03,096
Is he okay?

193
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:06,472
He's just tired...
from being in a coma so long.

194
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:07,585
What'd you take?

195
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:10,145
Don't worry.
He can keep a secret.

196
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,987
Antibiotics?

197
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:16,853
Penicillin?

198
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,692
Any of those names ring a bell?

199
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:25,759
Yeah, uh...my friend Elliot,
his dad had, like, a whole bottle
that he hadn't finished, so...

200
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:29,411
I swiped it and took a bunch
for, like, a week.

201
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:32,378
There's no way I was gonna risk
breathing germs on Melinda.

202
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:35,922
This is the one downside
of teenage sex:

203
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:37,416
You're idiots.

204
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,779
You almost killed
your girlfriend.

205
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,800
She's allergic to penicillin.

206
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,317
What, do you think there was
still some on my lips?

207
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:46,926
I brushed my teeth.

208
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:49,913
Think lower and more fun.

209
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:53,997
I mean, it can--

210
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,941
It can go through your stuff?

211
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,990
Totally, dude.

212
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:02,735
There's this administrator here,
whenever she gets sick,
she just gives me the prescription.

213
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:09,627
But you know, they tested Melinda,
they said...she wasn't allergic to my stuff.

214
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,277
Yeah, four days later.

215
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:15,402
By that time, the penicillin
was crusting up a sock
at the bottom of your hamper.

216
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:17,945
Do you have to tell her
it was my fault?

217
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:20,971
No.

218
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:25,616
Great part of being a grownup,
you never have to do anything.

219
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,378
You're releasing her?

220
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:35,872
What happened?
What did you find out?

221
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,578
Tests on your house ruled out
any environmental allergens.

222
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:39,871
Yeah, but what caused this?

223
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:43,226
We believe it's highly unlikely that
this set of circumstances will repeat itself.

224
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,411
What set of circumstances?

225
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:48,102
It's good news.
She's healthy.

226
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:51,127
- But you might want to talk--
- Cameron!

227
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:55,400
- I can't breathe.
- Getting the epi.

228
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:01,044
Lewis: Give her the shot!
- No murmurs, no friction rubs.

229
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,900
- What are you waiting for?
- Quiet.

230
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:06,022
She's coughing up white sputum.

231
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:08,458
Crackling two-thirds
of the way up.

232
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:12,112
Look at her neck.

233
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:14,196
Please. She is vomiting.
Would you give her the shot?

234
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:16,473
It's not an allergy.
It's her heart.

235
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:24,276
What's the good news?
What's the bad news?

236
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,206
Congestive heart failure.

237
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:27,576
Is which?

238
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:29,619
- Good news.
- Why?

239
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:32,922
I don't know.
It just sounded like you.

240
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:36,722
New puzzle piece.
Always good news.
What's the bad news?

241
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,802
We've got two puzzle pieces
from two different puzzles.

242
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:41,548
Seems that way.

243
00:13:41,632 --> 00:13:44,292
What if her anaphylaxis
wasn't anaphylaxis?

244
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:48,433
Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds could
cause a seizure and then heart failure.

245
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:52,735
And get cured by
a mommy-wielded epi pen?
It's anaphylaxis. What else?

246
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,647
What if they really are two puzzles?

247
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,702
You think she had two unrelated
rare conditions in one week?

248
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:01,420
- We explained the anaphylaxis.
- What do you mean, we? I did!

249
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:03,758
At least I thought I did.
Maybe I didn't.

250
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:05,586
Still, it was all me.

251
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:09,538
Heart problems aren't so rare for
someone who's had a heart transplant.

252
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,484
I say we assume House was
right about the anaphylaxis.

253
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,021
It is tempting.

254
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:19,436
Heart failure could be either infection,
coronary disease, or rejection.

255
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:22,433
Sorry. There's a reason
they call it the white board.

256
00:14:22,517 --> 00:14:23,979
It's not my rule.

257
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,030
What ties both
these conditions together?

258
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,803
Okay, we can all stare at each other,
or we can investigate
what caused the heart failure.

259
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:43,942
Just the heart failure.

260
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:46,747
You wanna give me
that black marker?

261
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:55,809
There's no fever,
so it's probably not infection.

262
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:59,218
Or no fever because she's been
on immunosuppressants
for the last six months.

263
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:03,379
Let's do a C.T.,
get a heart biopsy
and redo the blood work.

264
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,173
- Anything?
- Not yet.

265
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:10,379
So I hear you don't want
teenagers having sex.

266
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:12,478
Teen suicide rate isn't
high enough for you already?

267
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:13,939
I just think
those two are brats.

268
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,026
The girl undercuts her mother
any chance she gets.

269
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:19,175
Yeah, it's the daughter's fault.
Has nothing to do with
mom infantilizing her.

270
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,050
Good point.

271
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:23,885
Explains why parents
who don't pay attention get
such nice, well-adjusted children.

272
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,644
What's this?

273
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:27,359
Think it's vegetation?

274
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:28,512
Yeah.

275
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:31,547
The kind made of muscle
that opens your heart valves.

276
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,133
It's nothing.

277
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:34,878
She's clean.

278
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:40,174
It's good news.
You don't show any signs
of coronary artery disease.

279
00:15:40,393 --> 00:15:41,501
So what's next?

280
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:44,207
Well, blood work
to rule out infection,

281
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:47,369
and  then a heart surgical biopsy
to rule out rejection.

282
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,741
But you don't think you're gonna
rule out both things, do you?

283
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:52,079
No.

284
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:57,129
I'm gonna lose this heart, right?

285
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:59,340
Hopefully we'll find
the problem and fix it.

286
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,259
You'll keep
your heart a long time.

287
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:02,331
How long?

288
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:06,017
Well, there could be
drug breakthroughs that allow you
to keep it for decades more.

289
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:07,787
[Chuckles] Yeah.

290
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:10,947
That's the answer
my cardiologist always gives me.

291
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,755
I looked it up on the web.

292
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:15,689
It's like five or ten years, right?

293
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,611
That's about the average.

294
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,648
That's why I need to have a life.

295
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:26,267
Why can't you convince my mom
to let me go back to school?

296
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:30,980
M elinda,
you've got bigger worries
right now than missing school.

297
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:36,456
Until we figure out
what's wrong with your heart,
the safest place for you to be is right here.

298
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:07,778
"Pain in My Heart"
by Otis's Reddings

299
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,437
# Pain in my heart #

300
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,754
# Is treating me poor #

301
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,447
# Where can my baby be #

302
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:25,841
# Lord, no one knows #

303
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:30,775
# Pain in my heart #

304
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:35,450
#  Just won't let me sleep #

305
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,428
# Where can my baby be? #

306
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,256
# Lord, where can she be? #

307
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:47,445
# And now the days #

308
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,412
# Has begin to get tough #

309
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:52,849
# Said I want you to come back #

310
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,478
# Come back, come back, baby #

311
00:17:57,773 --> 00:18:01,318
# I've had enough, oh-oh...#

312
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:11,180
Where's...
the hooker, I assume?

313
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:13,538
Right up here, buddy.

314
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:20,357
You said
you'd hang the stethoscope
if you were having sex.

315
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:23,123
I didn't say it had to be
with another person.

316
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:27,134
Can you think of anything
that would tie together
anaphylaxis and heart failure?

317
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:28,018
No.

318
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,060
I was waiting
out there for hours!

319
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,146
I need a lot of foreplay.

320
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:35,719
And then there's
the cuddling afterwards.

321
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:40,053
Any way that
anaphylaxis isn't anaphylaxis
even it responds to epi?

322
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,313
No. Oh, no wonder
you were in the mood.

323
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:44,901
This month's
New Jersey Journal of Cardiology.

324
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,131
Have you seen the centerfold?

325
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,502
There's no way
those valves are real.

326
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:51,699
Any chance that the heart failure
could be unrelated to--

327
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:54,329
No. If you need
time alone to work,

328
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,458
you just have to say so.
You don't have to lie about it.

329
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,950
- Lying's more fun.
- Being lied to, not as much fun.

330
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:02,664
Please have an answer
to this question:

331
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,310
What's for dinner?

332
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,182
Wilson:
You still haven't done the dishes?

333
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:10,169
You want one of these?
I think I got a couple of blueberries.

334
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:13,772
Nope. Sorry. Just one.

335
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,914
Oh, don't look all weepy.

336
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,582
You got a problem with me,
deal with it.

337
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,461
Short my sheets or something.

338
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,447
[Sighs]

339
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:29,212
[Wilson does the dishes]

340
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,449
Biopsy was negative for rejection.

341
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:32,470
Thank God.

342
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:33,822
And what about the blood tests?

343
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,085
Showed no infection.

344
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,867
So we still don't know
what caused her heart failure.

345
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,292
Let's just be happy
she doesn't need a new heart.

346
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:43,078
Mrs. Bardach, it could have
just been a one-time thing.

347
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:45,295
So she has
an allergic reaction
and heart failure,

348
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,231
and neither of them
can be explained.

349
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:49,612
Are they doing
any more tests on her?

350
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:51,431
- No.
- She's not here.

351
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,005
Notify local hospitals, cab companies,
the state troopers, and local cops.

352
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,515
Any security officers off duty
are back on duty.

353
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:01,525
<i>Woman:
We're on it.</i>

354
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,623
And I'm going to need some pictures.
And go through those drawers.

355
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:08,082
And I want at least two people
going over the surveillance tapes.

356
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,475
That work?

357
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,276
Are those all her clothes?

358
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,758
Uh, yeah.

359
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,714
She's obviously
still in the building.

360
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,603
So where did she go?
What does she want?

361
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,263
See her boyfriend?

362
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:20,565
She didn't take her phone.

363
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,298
She wants to be outside.

364
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,917
If you're trying to
scare your parents, great job.

365
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,156
Can we go back now?

366
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,012
I hate her.

367
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:51,840
When I was eight years old,
I was sick.

368
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:56,433
- Not really sick,
but the point is, my mom, she--
- She was like this before.

369
00:20:56,518 --> 00:21:00,374
Home by 9:00 every night.
Can't go out on the weekends.
Can't do sports.

370
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:03,918
- Transplant just gave her
what she always wanted.
- Melinda...

371
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:06,502
You had heart failure.

372
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:11,531
This is kind of an insane time
to be criticizing your mom
about being overprotective.

373
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:19,003
I know. I mean, this is
what makes it even worse.
All of her craziness, it just...

374
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,584
It makes sense now.

375
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,037
Everything's gonna be all right.

376
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:28,432
I didn't even try to get outside.

377
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,211
I was too scared.

378
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:32,388
Come on.

379
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,595
Whoa, whoa. Melinda,
please walk back towards me.

380
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,819
Why?

381
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,763
Please?

382
00:21:56,276 --> 00:21:58,121
It feels kind of weird.

383
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,116
It's called steppage gait.

384
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,636
Lewis:
Is it serious?

385
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,250
No, not necessarily.

386
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:07,842
All right,
stick your leg out, hold it up.

387
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:13,467
She was under anesthesia
for the biopsy. If she lost oxygen--

388
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:15,704
C.T. ruled out brain damage.

389
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:19,280
Put your leg down.
Relax.

390
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,840
Why is her leg
twitching like that?

391
00:22:25,305 --> 00:22:26,466
Fasciculation.

392
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,924
Is that serious?

393
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,287
It's paralysis,
and it's ascending.

394
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:34,218
She's going to
lose the use of her legs?

395
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:40,894
To start with.

396
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:46,085
It's ascending fast.
She can hardly extend her leg now.

397
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:48,572
At this rate, it'll be up to
her lungs in a matter of days.

398
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,607
So, anaphylaxis,
heart failure, paralysis.

399
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,985
Couldn't put the first two together.
I'm guessing we can't put all three together.

400
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,320
Tick paralysis?

401
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:01,483
Could also explain the anaphylaxis,
maybe even the--

402
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,333
Penicillin allergy explains
the allergic reaction much better.

403
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:08,181
Particularly
because tick paralysis is
usually accompanied by a tick.

404
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,078
We did
two comprehensive physicals
looking for insect bites.

405
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:13,666
Can we put any two
of those together?

406
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,461
How about we stipulate?

407
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:18,262
You argued that there must be
something to connect all three symptoms,

408
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:21,948
you mocked us for not figuring it out,
and finally you let us discuss the paralysis

409
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,408
on its own because
it's what's gonna kill her.

410
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:25,573
Now, it's ascending.

411
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:28,156
Her MRIs are clean,
so rule out stroke or aneurysm.

412
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,152
- ALS? MS?
- Progression's too quick.

413
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,373
- Spinal lesion from leukemia?
- Too slow.

414
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:33,906
It's most likely
Guillain-Barre.

415
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,363
She's immunosuppressed.
What about botulism?

416
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,557
Not unless she's been
walking around on her hands
the last couple of days.

417
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:40,758
Botulism paralysis is
descending, not ascending.

418
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:41,712
Could be a virus.

419
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,125
West Nile, even polio
with her immune system shot.

420
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:47,500
Get an LP and
do PCRs for the viruses.

421
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:49,904
And get an EMG
to check for Guillain-Barre.

422
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:52,719
Foreman's right. We gotta
find out why she's paralyzed.

423
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:58,231
But not before staring at me
dumbly for a few seconds.

424
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:11,642
Foreman:
We ran more tests
on your daughter.

425
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,810
We took a lumbar puncture,
got some spinal fluid.

426
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:18,907
Then we brought her to the lab
to look for infections that
could be affecting her brain.

427
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:26,619
We also did an EMG to check
how her muscles and nerves are
responding to electrical impulses.

428
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,666
Unfortunately, her muscles are showing
increased weakness above the knee.

429
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,453
You mean she's getting worse?

430
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:35,773
The LP and PCRs ruled out
polio and West Nile.

431
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:37,866
We think it's Guillain-Barre.

432
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,762
The body's immune response
goes haywire and starts
attacking the peripheral nerves.

433
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:44,630
It causes
muscle weakness and paralysis.

434
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:46,314
How bad is it?

435
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:50,886
It's serious, but
Guillain-Barre usually responds
very well to plasmapheresis.

436
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:01,013
Foreman:
You see, the plasma,
the clear liquid part of her blood,

437
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:05,476
contains most of the antibodies,
which are overreacting and
attacking her nervous system.

438
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:10,441
The machine spins her blood
in a centrifuge and separates parts
of the blood based on weight.

439
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:14,896
White blood cells are the heaviest,
then the red cells, then platelets and plasma.

440
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:20,873
We discard the stuff that's causing
all the trouble and return the good blood cells
back to her body in a replacement fluid.

441
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:25,303
If it works, we'll see results
in a couple of days.

442
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,834
You didn't get any messages
for me last week, did you?

443
00:25:35,103 --> 00:25:35,856
Nope.

444
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,234
That's funny.

445
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:39,999
The guy finally called back.
The place I lost?

446
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:42,083
He said he left
three voice mails.

447
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:42,739
Gotta pee.

448
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:46,899
Which I never got,
if that wasn't clear.

449
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:48,622
He must be lying.

450
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,593
You wouldn't want
to live with a liar.

451
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:52,970
- You erased my messages?
- Yup.

452
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:55,027
Decided I wanted you to stay.

453
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:56,324
Told you that, didn't I?

454
00:25:56,531 --> 00:26:02,981
You're...miserable, and you're lonely, and
you're gonna trap me here to keep me
every bit as miserable and lonely, too.

455
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:06,117
- Yeah, and you're
happy, happy, happy.
- Okay.

456
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:09,141
Hey, I'm obviously going
through a rough patch here.

457
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:11,980
Wife leaves, tends
to bum somebody out.

458
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:15,137
Do you know
where my pee went?

459
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,365
You're missing some?

460
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:22,506
No. Came out of me and
went right into the toilet.

461
00:26:22,591 --> 00:26:24,253
Now, why would that be?

462
00:26:25,055 --> 00:26:26,272
You're William Tell.

463
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:28,069
You could pick an apple
off someone's head?

464
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,104
No, it's because there was
no clear plastic wrap over the toilet.

465
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:34,195
Stuff's in the kitchen.
You have plenty of time.
All that was missing was the will.

466
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,122
This isn't a college dorm.

467
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:37,441
It could be.

468
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,340
We're not 18!

469
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,559
So what?

470
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:41,711
What did I do to you?

471
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:45,154
I scammed you into doing the dishes,
I made you sit on the steps.

472
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:47,240
I didn't kill your puppy.

473
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,314
I did not make you miserable.

474
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,331
Oh, so this is therapy?

475
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:55,589
No. It's just...
makes me smile.

476
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:58,148
All right, I'm finding
a new place tomorrow.

477
00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:00,639
Right, but not tonight.
[Pops cork]

478
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:03,654
Well, I figure you wanna shave
my eyebrows while I'm asleep.

479
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:05,894
I wouldn't wanna
deprive you of that last smile.

480
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,488
You're not going anywhere.

481
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:09,148
You're gonna sit on my couch,

482
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,770
and depress us both,
because you just can't admit
that it's over with your wife.

483
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:14,469
That's right.
I'm here on vacation.

484
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:16,060
Have you gotten a lawyer yet?

485
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:22,012
- That's--That's not...
- You even called one?

486
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:26,526
As long as you're here,
it's just a fight.

487
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:31,126
As soon as you get a place,
then it's a divorce.

488
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:37,728
Everything sucks.

489
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:41,510
Might as well find
something to smile about.

490
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,490
Reflexes are
marginally weaker.

491
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:56,066
The paralysis is getting worse?

492
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,270
Sometimes it takes a few treatments
for the plasmapheresis to work.

493
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:02,647
Why do these things
keep happening to me?

494
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,194
Dan's back.

495
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:09,232
Hey, baby, did you hear that?
Dan's here.

496
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:12,433
I don't want to see him.

497
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,843
I'll tell him
to come back later.

498
00:28:17,952 --> 00:28:18,745
No.

499
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:22,637
Mommy, stay here, please.

500
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,637
Of course.

501
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:47,126
...

502
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,831
Is she okay?

503
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:02,002
She's sleeping.

504
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,855
I'm sure she's exhausted.

505
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,665
Mood swings are common
with the anti-rejection meds.

506
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,633
No. She's had mood swings.
This isn't it. This is--

507
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,065
She's given up.

508
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,282
I know you think I'm--

509
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:21,987
This isn't what I wanted.

510
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,206
She's always fought with me.

511
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:31,096
Ever since she was a baby,
she was so damn stubborn.

512
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,134
But I never
wanted her like this.

513
00:29:35,846 --> 00:29:38,542
I just wanted her safe.

514
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,060
Doctor! Doctor!
[Beeping]

515
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,174
She can't breathe!

516
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:47,003
She couldn't get
a whole sentence out.

517
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:51,537
She's using accessory muscles.

518
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:53,524
- 02 sat's down to 90. Lungs clear?
- Yeah.

519
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:55,194
Does your tongue feel
swollen? Is it itchy?

520
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:56,349
No hives.

521
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:57,981
It's not an allergy.

522
00:29:58,065 --> 00:30:00,191
Lips are cyanotic.
We got to intubate.

523
00:30:00,454 --> 00:30:01,905
What are you doing?

524
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:03,551
Pushing lorazepam.

525
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,816
She's not getting enough oxygen.
We've got to assist her breathing.

526
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,871
What was that?
Was that a reaction
to the treatment?

527
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:21,510
It's the paralysis.

528
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:22,949
It's reaching her lungs.

529
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:31,834
Chase:
Melinda's dying.

530
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,090
We're all dying.

531
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:35,428
How fast?

532
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:37,319
Too fast for Guillain-Barre.

533
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,299
Cuddy wants to get her an MRI
to rule out a spinal lesion.

534
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:43,773
Cuddy?
What's shedoing on this?

535
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:46,042
The family lost confidence in us.

536
00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:47,717
I don't blame them.

537
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,669
I'll be right in.

538
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:06,141
It's like she got poisoned
with a nerve agent.

539
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,420
Glue inhalation. Would explain
why she hasn't admitted it.

540
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:09,914
Tox screen was clear for pot.

541
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:13,053
Middle-class heart transplant
patient's gonna huff glue?

542
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:14,325
Pesticides?

543
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,932
Cameron:
This time of year,
they're not spraying.

544
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:17,490
This girl's tough.

545
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:19,794
She gets what she wants.

546
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:23,836
She's deprived of human contact,
she gets herself a backdoor man.

547
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,293
Or in her case, a side window boy.
What else has she been deprived of?

548
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:29,311
She's on a special diet
because of her allergies.

549
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:34,174
The boyfriend brings the hot beef.
He also brings a side dish: botulism.

550
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:36,294
This is paralysis is
ascending, remember?

551
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:38,776
Not if the heart problem's
really a paralytic problem.

552
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,748
Why would she admit the sex
and not the food?

553
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,888
She didn't admit anything.

554
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:45,821
He admitted the sex, and
we didn't ask him about food.

555
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:46,894
Get me a rat.

556
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:48,811
- You have a rat.
- What?

557
00:31:48,995 --> 00:31:50,994
I'm not gonna kill Steve.

558
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:52,829
Only way to confirm this...

559
00:31:52,892 --> 00:31:57,860
inject the rat with her blood and wait
for it to get all botulistic on your ass.

560
00:31:57,944 --> 00:32:02,905
In the meantime,
I'm going downstairs to browbeat
a scared, dying teenage girl until she...

561
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,463
breaks down like
a scared, dying teenage girl.

562
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,224
- You're up early.
- Cuddy needed a consult.

563
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:16,024
We're checking for
spinal lesions from leukemia.

564
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:18,671
Yeah, I know.
Fits perfectly.

565
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:21,826
Unless this is the patient with
the anaphylaxis, the heart failure,

566
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:24,148
and the paralysis, in which case,
you're wasting your time.

567
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,499
We wanted a second opinion.

568
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:27,585
Second? We must have
given you at least eight.

569
00:32:27,706 --> 00:32:29,562
Okay, well here's nine.

570
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,712
Botulism.

571
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:35,268
Listen to me.
Have you eaten anything abnormal?

572
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,102
- Any canned foods?
- No.

573
00:32:37,186 --> 00:32:42,803
You sure? Lying to your parents is
usually the right thing to do, but
there is an impending death exception.

574
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:44,133
Don't talk to her like that.

575
00:32:44,217 --> 00:32:47,118
You're right. She never lies.
I was being rude.

576
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:49,303
When your boyfriend
snuck in on Friday night--

577
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:50,989
surprise--

578
00:32:51,074 --> 00:32:53,865
perhaps he got you some
sexy little treats, huh?

579
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:59,163
Some honey or some edible underwear,
some massage oils. Come on, anything.

580
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:00,871
[Gags]
We didn't--

581
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:02,888
Yeah, yeah,
we know about the sex.

582
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:05,646
Turns out that Danny's
little Danny is full of penicillin.

583
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,804
That's what caused
your anaphylactic shock.

584
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:09,372
You didn't tell us that's what--

585
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,275
It was--
He took clindamycin.
What I use.

586
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,618
He said he was on penicillin.

587
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,911
I saw the bottle.

588
00:33:21,014 --> 00:33:23,082
It's a non-penicillin antibiotic.

589
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,845
If the antibiotics didn't
cause the anaphylaxis...

590
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,508
It's still on the table.

591
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:29,172
Everything is connected.

592
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:31,130
What did we discuss?
What was the differential?

593
00:33:31,196 --> 00:33:32,816
Cameron said...

594
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:39,055
When Dan came to your house that night,
did he go through any tall grass?

595
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,057
Climbed a fence.

596
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:47,842
What are you doing?

597
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:50,051
Your daughter had
two visitors on Friday night.

598
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:51,882
One of them is still in the room.

599
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:54,682
She has tick paralysis.

600
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,903
Dan tracked a tick onto his jeans,

601
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:01,280
which wouldn't be a problem.
But being a teenager,

602
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:03,548
Dan couldn't keep
his tick in his pants.

603
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:05,481
Foreman:
We already checked her.

604
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:07,456
Now I'm checking her.

605
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,125
Tick bites don't ordinarily
cause anaphylactic shock.

606
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:12,121
This girl's allergies
are not ordinary.

607
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:15,631
House, get out of here.
We have to re-intubate her,
get her into the MRI.

608
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:17,321
The time course is perfect.

609
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:19,544
The bite itself sets off
an allergic reaction.

610
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,660
Venom takes four days to kick in,
heart's vulnerable, hits that first,

611
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:25,811
and a day later sets off
the ascending paralysis.

612
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:27,825
Except that ticks
aren't usually invisible.

613
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,589
They are until you find them.

614
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:35,456
Oh no, that's dandruff.
That wasn't nearly
as dramatic as I'd hoped.

615
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:37,646
Just means the next time
it'll be even better.

616
00:34:38,098 --> 00:34:40,198
[Monitors start beeping]

617
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:41,825
What's happening?

618
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,631
That's the tick venom ascending.

619
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,965
That or you stressed her
into heart failure. BP's dropping.

620
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:49,622
- Heart rate, 47.
- I'm administering atropine.

621
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,173
She's going to need
a transvenous pacing wire.

622
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,332
Okay, magical tick hunt is over.

623
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:56,054
Only real doctor stuff now.

624
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:57,964
This is just gonna get worse.

625
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,986
Ticks produce more toxins
the longer they feed.

626
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,287
She's gonna be dead in an hour
even if you pump her heartfull of jet fuel,

627
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:06,027
unless you let me find the tick.

628
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,875
Could he be right?

629
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:11,536
The only thing I know for sure is
that your daughter's heart won't last
another 20 minutes without treatment.

630
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,429
Okay, I just need
one final instruction.

631
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:16,168
When I find the tick on the autopsy,
do you want to know?

632
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:18,628
I'm thinking not.
Probably make the coping easier.

633
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,200

634
00:35:20,281 --> 00:35:22,945

Get her team down here stat.

635
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:24,514
Get them out of here.
Get House out of here, too.

636
00:35:24,598 --> 00:35:26,387
Dr. Wilson, I could use your help.

637
00:35:28,285 --> 00:35:30,218
Well, I don't know
if the dopamine's enough.

638
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:32,075
She may need
inamrinone lactate.

639
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,604
Why? What's that?
She doesn't--

640
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:36,487
She might need stronger pressors.
They don't have any in radiology.

641
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:39,836
Inamrinone can cause
arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia.

642
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,820
Not inamrinone could cause death.
Death's worse.

643
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:45,459
We have to get her up to the ICU.

644
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:02,054

645
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:03,550

650
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:22,191
Well, as long as we're stuck here,
this might be a good time
to look for that tick.

651
00:36:22,276 --> 00:36:23,644
Turn the elevator back on.

652
00:36:23,728 --> 00:36:25,185

We've got to get her upstairs
and put her on norepinephrine.

658
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:43,970
It wasn't penicillin.

659
00:36:44,054 --> 00:36:45,539
You still think
the symptoms are unconnected?

660
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:46,953

of her heart before--

661

your paint's peeling,
your curtains are gone,

Which problem do you deal with first?

663

- House--
- None of them!

We find the cause, she lives.

666
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:01,699
That tick is an I.V. drip of poison.
We unhook it, she'll be fine.

Left foot's clean.

678
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:46,346
If it's not here,
we've only got--

679
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,564
[Beeping]
- Heart rate's 46.
- It's here.

680
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:52,375
Looks like a mole or a freckle.
Something we missed.

681
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,100
Check the armpits.

682
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:58,739
[Wheezes]

683
00:37:58,865 --> 00:38:01,617
Dr. Foreman's an excellent doctor.
He'll be able to handle it.

684
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:03,148
Yeah? You know that
from experience?

685
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:04,826
You lose a lot of patients
on elevators?

686
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:08,823
The maintenance guy said
it didn't just stop on its own, that
they hit the emergency stop button.

687
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,950
Well, I'm sure
he must be mistaken.

688
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:16,417
- Perineum.
- We checked it.

689
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,333
- If we get her upstairs--
- Maxilla.
- Checked.

690
00:38:22,207 --> 00:38:24,348
Down to 38.
We don't have a lot of time.

691
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:27,174
Eyebrows, eardrums,
pubic hair.

692
00:38:27,258 --> 00:38:29,532
Checked, checked, checked.
We checked everywhere!

693
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:32,088
It's not--
[beeping]

694
00:38:32,825 --> 00:38:35,113
35. We got to get her to the ICU.

695
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:36,665
We haven't found the tick yet.

696
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:38,741
We already kidnapped her!
You want to add murder?

697
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,629
We've looked over every inch of skin on her body, House!

698
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:43,504
It's over.

699
00:38:51,753 --> 00:38:54,664
Hey, is that the first time
you had sex?

700
00:38:57,144 --> 00:39:00,207
With all the other stuff
going on down there,
she might not have realized.

701
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:01,823
Oh...

702
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,860
[Elevator dings]

703
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,342
You sick, miserable--

704
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:18,410
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God!

705
00:39:18,474 --> 00:39:19,585
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

706
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,368
See? Told you it'd be
even more dramatic.

707
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:33,578
Push norepinephrine.
Get her heart back to normal.
She'll be completely cured by tomorrow.

708
00:39:35,612 --> 00:39:37,999
Foreman, let's get her into the ICU.

709
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:55,528
Inamrinone was a stupid idea,

710
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,468
unless you wanted me
to get that girl on the elevator.

711
00:39:58,618 --> 00:39:59,970
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

712
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:01,676
Wouldn't respect you
if you did.

713
00:40:09,645 --> 00:40:16,582
Wow. Looks like somebody filed
halfway through your cane
while you were sleeping.

714
00:40:43,118 --> 00:40:46,754
Reflexes back to normal.
Heart's looking good, too.

715
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:51,492
I'll send in the nurse,
we'll get you transferred out of ICU,
you'll be discharged in the morning.

716
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:54,782
Thank God.
I just want to get home.

717
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,282
And back to school
on Monday.

718
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:01,016
I'm-I'm not ready.

719
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,227
You're ready.

720
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:05,525
I'm sick, Mom.

721
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:07,562
You're not sick.

722
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:09,961
You're gonna go to class,

723
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:13,644
and you're gonna see your friends
and your boyfriend.

724
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:22,833
<i>[James Stewart on TV]
What's this doohickey?</i>

725
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:26,473
<i>Barbara Bel Geddes:
It's a brassiere.</i>

726
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:29,813

You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.</i>

Well, I've never across one like that.</i>

728

It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift.
I've explained to you--</i>

729
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:42,393
<i>Stewart:
I know, I know. I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo. And I get dizzy.</i>

730
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:46,362
<i>Stewart:
What a moment to find out I had it.</i>

731
00:41:46,428 --> 00:41:50,701
<i>Bel Geddes:
You've got it, and there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame. So why quit?</i>

732
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:53,485
<i>Stewart:
You mean, and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?</i>

733
00:41:53,486 --> 00:41:55,251

Where you belong.</i>

What about my acrophobia?</i>

735
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:59,152
I called a divorce lawyer today.

736
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:03,109
Does that mean you're leaving?

737
00:42:03,895 --> 00:42:05,584
At some point.

738
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:14,571
You might not
wanna sit exactly there.
