1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,600
Dean,you're not gonna go to hell.

2
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,100
Sic him,boy.

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Somebody help me!

4
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,700
Getting pretty slick there,Sam.

5
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,360
What the hell is going
on around here,ruby?

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,900
Who are you?

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,700
Castiello.

8
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm the one who gripped you tight
and raised you from perdition.

9
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,000
I mean  what  are you?

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm an angel of the lord.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,370
Why would an angel
rescue me from hell?

12
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,100
Because god commanded it.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,670
Because we have work for you.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,570
Hey,it's olivia.I'm
not in. Leave a message.

15
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,290
Olivia,it's Bobby.

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,830
Call me back,would you?

17
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,830
I got something big.I
could use your help.

18
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,130
You!

19
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,880
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,210
I'm so sorry.

21
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,210
Supernatural season 4  episode 2

22
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Well,then tell me
what else it could be.

23
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,190
Look,all I know is I was
not groped by an angel.

24
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,600
Okay,look,Dean.

25
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Why do you think this castiello
would lie to you about it?

26
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,300
Maybe he's some kind
of demon. Demons lie.

27
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,930
A demon who's immune to salt
rounds and devil's traps...

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,230
And ruby's knife?

29
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,360
Dean,lilith is scared of that thing!

30
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,730
Don't you think that
if angels were real,

31
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,100
That some hunter somewhere

32
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,960
Would have seen one...
at some point...ever?

33
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,030
Yeah. You just did,Dean.

34
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,980
I'm trying to come
up with a theory here.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,130
Okay? Work with me.

36
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,560
Dean,we have a theory.

37
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,200
Yeah,one with a little less
fairy dust on it,please.

38
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay,look. I'm not
saying we know for sure.

39
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm just saying
that I think we --

40
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,700
Okay,okay. That's the point.

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,420
We don't know for sure,so
I'm not gonna believe

42
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,690
That this thing is a
freaking angel of the lord

43
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,120
Because it says so!

44
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,720
You two chuckleheads want
to keep arguing religion,

45
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,220
Or do you want to come
take a look at this?

46
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,000
I got stacks of lore --
Biblical,pre-Biblical.

47
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,400
Some of it's in damn cuneiform.

48
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,100
It all says an angel can
snatch a soul from the pit.

49
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,510
What else?

50
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,710
What else,what?

51
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,840
What else could do it?

52
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,870
Airlift your ass out of the hot box?

53
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,970
As far as I can tell,nothing.

54
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,140
Dean,this is good news. How?

55
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,440
Because for once,

56
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,610
This isn't just another
round of demon crap.

57
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,810
I mean,maybe you were saved

58
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,440
Okay. Say it's true.
Say there are angels.

59
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,010
Then what? There's a god?

60
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,570
At this point,vegas money's on yeah.

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,810
I don't know,guys.

62
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,160
Okay,look.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,760
I know you're not all
choirboy about this stuff,

64
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,190
But this is becoming
less and less about faith

65
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,960
And more and more about proof.

66
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,490
Proof? Yes.

67
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,820
Proof that there's a god out there

68
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,560
That actually gives a
crap about me personally?

69
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,520
I'm sorry,but I'm not buying it.

70
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,690
Why not?

71
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,200
Because why me?

72
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,520
If there is a god out there,why
would he give a crap about me?

73
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,280
Dean -- I mean,I've
saved some people,okay?

74
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,260
I figured that made
up for the stealing

75
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,160
But why do I deserve to get
saved? I'm just a regular guy.

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,700
Apparently,you're a regular guy

77
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,100
That's important to the man upstairs.

78
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,240
Well,that creeps me out.

79
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,520
I mean,I don't like getting
singled out at birthday parties,

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,850
... much less by...god.

81
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,270
Okay,well,too bad,Dean,

82
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,000
Because I think he wants you
to strap on your party hat.

83
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,470
All right. What do
we know about angels?

84
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,800
Start reading.

85
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,200
You're gonna get me some pie.

86
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,220
Yes,Dean,I'll get the chips.

87
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,100
Dude.

88
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,400
When have I ever forgotten the pie?

89
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,630
Exactly.

90
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,450
I got to go.

91
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,180
Yeah,all right. Bye.

92
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,250
-
- Ruby. So,is it true?

93
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,610
Is what true?

94
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,610
Did an angel rescue Dean?

95
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,750
You heard.

96
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,680
Who hasn't?

97
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,450
100% we're not 100%
sure,but I think so.

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,740
Okay. Bye,Sam.

99
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,410
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.
Wait. What's going on?

100
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,280
Sam,they're angels. I'm a demon.

101
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,480
They're not gonna care
if I'm being helpful.

102
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,080
They smite first,and then
they ask questions later.

103
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,980
What do you know about them?

104
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,310
Not much.

105
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,410
I've never met one,and
I don't really want to.

106
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,940
All I know is that they
scare the holy hell out of me.

107
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,540
Watch yourself,Sam.

108
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,910
I'm not scared of angels.

109
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,780
Keep the engine running.

110
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,080
Why? What's going on?

111
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,640
I got a friend one state
over -- Olivia lowry.

112
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,600
I've been trying to reach her for
three days on this angel thing.

113
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,690
It's not like her to
ignore this many calls.

114
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,390
Olivia lowry --
A hunter,right?

115
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,510
Yeah. We're gonna go check
on her. You guys follow me.

116
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,050
Scoot over. Yeah.

117
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,390
Dude? Yeah?

118
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,210
Where's the pie?

119
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,740
Olivia?

120
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,940
Bobby?

121
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,480
Salt line.

122
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,800
Emf olivia was rocking the emf meter.

123
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,540
Spirit activity.

124
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,210
Yeah -- On
steroids.

125
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,040
I never seen a ghost
do this to a person.

126
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,810
Boy,you all right?

127
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,880
I called some hunters nearby...

128
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,050
Good. We can use their help.

129
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,360
...except they ain't
answering their phones either.

130
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,950
Something's up,huh?

131
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,000
You think?

132
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,340
Yeah,this is jed. I'm not
around. Uh,leave a message.

133
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,270
Jed,Dean
winchester again --

134
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,350
Friend of Bobby singer's.

135
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,070
Look,we think something's happening.

136
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,750
We think it's happening to hunters.

137
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,530
Just want to make sure
you're okay. Call me back.

138
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:06,248
It's not pretty.

139
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,318
He looks even worse than
olivia. What about you?

140
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,998
R.C. I checked on carl
bates and r.C. Adams.

141
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:13,818
They've redecorated... in red.

142
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,218
What the hell is going on here,Bobby?

143
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:18,608
Why did a bunch of ghosts

144
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,178
Suddenly want to
gank off-Duty hunters?

145
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,208
I don't know,but until we find out,

146
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,008
You guys better get
your asses to my place.

147
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,538
We're on our way.

148
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:39,208
Hi,Sam. It's been a while.

149
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:42,698
Hi,guys. It's been a while.

150
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,938
So,how do we survive?

151
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:49,068
Henriksen. Are
you -- Did you...

152
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:52,908
I didn't survive...

153
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:55,518
If that's what you're asking.

154
00:11:57,898 --> 00:11:58,838
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:00,608
I know you are.

156
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:02,398
Look,if we'd known
lilith was coming --

157
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,798
You wouldn't have left
half a dozen innocent people

158
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:06,358
In that police station
to die in your place.

159
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,098
You did this to me.
It was your fault.

160
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:15,328
She was after you,and
I paid the price.

161
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:16,928
You left us there to die!

162
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:06,698
Damn it,Bobby! Pick up!

163
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:09,228
How you feeling,huh? How
many fingers am I holding up?

164
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,528
None. I'll be fine,Dean.

165
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:12,898
Henriksen? Yep.

166
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,228
Why? What did he want?

167
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,028
Revenge 'cause we got him killed.

168
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:18,058
Sam. Well,we did,Dean.

169
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:19,858
All right. Stop right there.

170
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:22,198
Whatever the hell is going
on,it's happening to us now,okay?

171
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:24,618
I can't get ahold of Bobby,so
if you're not thinking answers,

172
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:25,428
Don't think at all.

173
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:33,298
Bobby?

174
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:02,858
I'll go. You check outside.

175
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:16,228
Bobby?

176
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:21,858
Bobby?

177
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:39,898
Bobby?

178
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:54,858
Come out,come out,whoever you are.

179
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:05,558
Dean winchester. Still so bossy.

180
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,458
You don't recognize me?

181
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:14,858
This is what I looked like

182
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:16,928
Before that demon cut off my hair

183
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:18,498
And dressed me like a slut.

184
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:22,758
Dean.

185
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:29,328
Meg?

186
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:31,828
Hi.

187
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:40,428
It's okay

188
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:42,878
I'm not demon

189
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:45,468
You're the girl the demon possessed.

190
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:46,798
Meg masters.

191
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,548
Nice to finally talk to you

192
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:54,298
When I'm not,you
know,choking on my own blood.

193
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:57,844
It's okay.

194
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:01,514
Seriously,I'm just a college girl.

195
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,474
Sorry
-- Was.

196
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:08,104
I was walking home one night

197
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:10,804
And got jumped by all this smoke.

198
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:13,434
Next thing you know,I'm a prisoner...

199
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:14,874
In here.

200
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:20,134
Now,I was awake.

201
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:23,604
I had to watch while
she murdered people.

202
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,604
I'm sorry.

203
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:27,834
Oh,yeah?

204
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:30,334
So sorry you had me
thrown off a building.

205
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:38,634
-Well,we thought --
- No,you didn't think!

206
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:41,604
I kept waiting,praying!

207
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:44,234
I was trapped in
there screaming at you!

208
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,904
"Just help me,please!"

209
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,374
You're supposed to help people,Dean.

210
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,034
Why didn't you help me?

211
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,004
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:54,904
Stop saying you're sorry!

213
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:58,634
Meg. Meg...

214
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:06,634
We didn't know.

215
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:08,604
No...

216
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:11,634
You just attacked.

217
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:14,534
Did you ever think
there was a girl in here?

218
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:16,904
No.

219
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:21,134
You just charged
in,slashing and burning.

220
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:26,004
You think you're some kind of hero?

221
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:28,574
No,I don't.

222
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,504
You're damn right.

223
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:34,034
Do you have any idea what it's like

224
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:37,234
To be ridden for
months by pure evil...

225
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:43,274
...while your family has no
idea what happened to you?

226
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:47,304
We did the best we could.

227
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:51,274
Are you scared,Bobby?
We were scared,Bobby.

228
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:54,304
When the monster came for
us... and grabbed us tight.

229
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:57,404
And we couldn't even scream.
You were right there,Bobby.

230
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:58,504
You were in the house.

231
00:18:58,574 --> 00:19:00,474
You were so close.

232
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:12,654
Bobby?

233
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,394
You could have saved us nBobby.

234
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:15,654
We're here   Bobby?

235
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,954
You walked right past nthat door.

236
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,794
The monster had us.
Nand you didn't find us.

237
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,394
And now nthey won't find you.

238
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:32,824
It wasn't just me
Dean. Ni had a sister.

239
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:39,724
A little sister. She worshiped me.

240
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:43,694
You know how nlittle
siblings are   right?

241
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:46,454
How they'll do anything for you.

242
00:19:46,524 --> 00:19:50,694
She was never the Same
nafter I disappeared.

243
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,594
She just...

244
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:56,694
She just got lost.

245
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:03,024
And when my body was
lying in the morgue

246
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:05,624
Beat-Up,broken... meg.

247
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:07,124
...do you know what that did to her?

248
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:11,354
She killed herself!
Nbecause of you   Dean!

249
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:14,574
Because all you were thinking
about was your family,

250
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,834
Your revenge,and your demons!

251
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:20,434
50 words of latin a little
sooner,and I'd still be alive.

252
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:26,674
My baby sister would still be alive.

253
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:30,034
That blood is on your hands,Dean!

254
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,404
You're right.

255
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:43,934
Bobby!

256
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:46,304
Hold on,Bobby! I'm coming!

257
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:48,774
Bobby!

258
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:15,634
Come on,Dean.

259
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:19,234
Did your brain get
french-Fried in hell?

260
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:21,334
You can't shoot me with bullets.

261
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:23,804
I'm not shooting you.

262
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,834
Iron.

263
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,874
So,they're all people we know?

264
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:38,704
Not just know. People
we couldn't save.

265
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,134
Hey,I saw something on meg.

266
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:43,704
Did she have a tattoo
when she was alive?

267
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:45,974
I don't think so.

268
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:48,634
It was like a-A mark on her
hand -- Almost like a brand.

269
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:51,334
- I saw a mark,too,on henriksen.
- What did it look like?

270
00:21:51,404 --> 00:21:55,174
Uh,paper? Thanks.

271
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:04,234
That's it.

272
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:06,434
I may have seen this before.

273
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:11,434
We got to move. Whoa.

274
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,434
- Follow me. Okay.
- Where are we going?

275
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,104
Some place safe,you idiot.

276
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,204
Bobby,is this

277
00:23:12,274 --> 00:23:15,574
Solid iron. Completely
coated in salt.

278
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:17,174
100% ghost-Proof.

279
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:19,404
You built a panic room?

280
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:22,134
I had a weekend off.

281
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,734
-Bobby.
- What?

282
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:28,074
You're awesome.

283
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:54,254
See,this is why I
can't get behind god.

284
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:56,854
What are you talking about?

285
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:59,324
If he doesn't exist,fine. Bad
crap happens to good people.

286
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:00,924
That's how it is.

287
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:04,924
There's no rhyme or reason --
Just random,horrible,evil --

288
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:06,784
I get it,okay. I can roll with that.

289
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:10,324
But if he is out
there,what's wrong with him?

290
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:12,754
Where the hell is he while
all these decent people

291
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,324
Are getting torn to shreds?

292
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,124
How does he live with himself?

293
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:18,624
You know,why doesn't he help?

294
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:24,254
I ain't touching this
one with at 10-Foot pole.

295
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:25,984
Yeah.

296
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:28,384
-Found it.
-What?

297
00:24:28,454 --> 00:24:32,354
The symbol you saw - - The
brand on the ghosts... yeah?

298
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:33,624
Mark of the witness.

299
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:36,384
Witness? Witness to what?

300
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:37,684
The unnatural.

301
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:41,624
None of them died what
you'd call ordinary deaths.

302
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:45,224
See,these ghosts --
They were forced to rise.

303
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,324
They woke up in agony.
They were like rabid dogs.

304
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,854
It ain't their fault.

305
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:53,584
Someone rose them... on purpose. Who?

306
00:24:53,654 --> 00:24:54,984
Do I look like I know?

307
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:58,484
But whoever it was
used a spell so powerful

308
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:01,954
It left a mark,a
brand on their souls.

309
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:07,754
Whoever did this had big plans.

310
00:25:07,824 --> 00:25:09,924
It's called "the rising
of the witnesses."

311
00:25:09,984 --> 00:25:11,824
It figures into an ancient prophecy.

312
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:13,084
Wait,wait.

313
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:14,484
What -- What book is
that prophecy from?

314
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,354
Well,the widely distributed version's

315
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:19,524
Just for tourists,you know.

316
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,254
But long story
short -- Revelations.

317
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:26,754
This is a sign,boys.

318
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:31,084
A sign of what? A sign of what?

319
00:25:36,154 --> 00:25:38,524
The apocalypse.

320
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:52,584
Apocalypse?

321
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:55,194
The apocalypse,apocalypse?

322
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:56,924
The four horsemen,pestilence,

323
00:25:56,994 --> 00:25:59,574
$5-A-Gallon-Gas
apocalypse?

324
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:00,924
That's the one.

325
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:05,224
The rise of the witnesses
is a mile marker.

326
00:26:05,294 --> 00:26:07,194
Okay,so,what do we do now?

327
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,444
Road trip.

328
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:11,914
Grand canyon,star trek experience.

329
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:13,714
Bunny ranch.

330
00:26:13,784 --> 00:26:16,284
First things first.

331
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:19,314
-
- How about we survive our friends out there? Great.

332
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:21,614
Any ideas aside from staying
in this room until judgment day?

333
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,814
It's a spell

334
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,284
To send the witnesses back to rest.

335
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:29,544
Should work...

336
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:30,944
Should. Great.

337
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:32,984
...if I translate it correctly.

338
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:35,344
I think I got everything
we need here at the house.

339
00:26:35,414 --> 00:26:37,744
Any chance you got everything
we need here in this room?

340
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:39,944
So,you thought our
luck was gonna start now

341
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:41,984
All of a sudden?

342
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:45,784
Spell's got to be
cast over an open fire.

343
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:48,114
The fireplace in the library.

344
00:26:48,184 --> 00:26:49,684
Bingo.

345
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:52,044
That's just not as appealing

346
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:55,814
As a ghost-Proof
panic room,you know?

347
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:08,984
Cover each other. And aim careful.

348
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:13,244
Don't run out of ammo until
I'm done,or they'll shred you.

349
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:14,814
Ready?

350
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:56,414
Hey,Dean. You remember me?

351
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:00,484
Everybody on the floor now!

352
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:04,944
He's got the laser eyes.

353
00:28:05,014 --> 00:28:08,644
Ronald,huh? With the laser eyes?

354
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,644
I wish I could say
it's good to see you.

355
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:13,544
I am dead because of you.

356
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:16,914
You were supposed to help me!

357
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:23,614
If you're gonna
shoot,shoot. Don't talk.

358
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:44,884
Upstairs,linen closet --
Red hex box. It'll be heavy.

359
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:46,514
Got it.

360
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:52,984
Bobby.

361
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:04,044
Kitchen. Cutlery drawer.

362
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:05,144
It's got a false bottom.

363
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:07,484
Hemlock,opium,wormwood.

364
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:09,814
- Opium?
- Go!

365
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,444
Bobby.

366
00:29:14,514 --> 00:29:19,584
You walked right by us while
that monster ate us all up.

367
00:29:19,644 --> 00:29:21,444
You could have saved us.

368
00:29:44,944 --> 00:29:49,944
You know what really
pisses me off,Sam?

369
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:52,214
You saw how I suffered for months.

370
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:55,944
I thought you must
have learned something.

371
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:59,414
I thought I died for something.

372
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:00,714
Meg.

373
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:02,484
But what you're doing
with that demon,ruby...

374
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:11,114
How many innocent bodies has
ruby burned through for kicks?

375
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,284
How many girls just like me?

376
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,844
And you don't send her back to hell?

377
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:18,544
You're a monster!

378
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:31,614
- Dean?
- I'm all right,Bobby! Keep working!

379
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,614
Victor.

380
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:44,284
Dean.

381
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,744
I know.

382
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:48,014
No. You don't.

383
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:50,644
It's my fault you're dead.

384
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:52,884
I left you behind.

385
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:56,714
And the minute I heard about
that explosion,I thought,

386
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:59,284
"I should have known."

387
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:00,884
I should have protected you.

388
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:08,114
Unh-Unh. Not so fast.

389
00:31:08,184 --> 00:31:10,414
You think you left and lilith came

390
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:14,844
And we all died in a beautiful
blast of...white light?

391
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,614
... if only.

392
00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:21,114
45 minutes.

393
00:31:21,184 --> 00:31:22,714
What?

394
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,244
Over 45 minutes.

395
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:27,084
Lilith said she wanted
to have some fun.

396
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:29,014
The secretary was first.

397
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:31,944
Remember her? Nancy,the virgin.

398
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:36,284
Lilith filleted nancy's
skin off piece by piece

399
00:31:36,344 --> 00:31:39,314
Right in front of us,made us watch.

400
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:42,384
-
- Nancy never stopped screaming. No.

401
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,614
That was the last.

402
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:48,644
Victor...

403
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,544
Tell me how it's fair.

404
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:56,844
You get saved
from hell -- I die.

405
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,784
Why do you deserve
another chance,Dean?

406
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:10,284
You all right?

407
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,044
No.

408
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:14,014
Let's go.

409
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:28,884
Ronald. Hey,come on,man.
I thought we were pals.

410
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:30,914
That's when I was breathing.

411
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:32,984
Now I'm gonna eat you alive.

412
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:37,344
Well...come on,I'm
not a cheeseburger.

413
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,914
No!

414
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:58,814
-Sam!
-Cover Bobby!

415
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:14,714
Bobby!

416
00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,414
Dean!

417
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:22,614
Fireplace!

418
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:37,784
Bobby?

419
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:41,654
Excellent job with the witnesses.

420
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:43,824
You were hip to all this?

421
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:46,464
I was,uh,made aware.

422
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:49,794
Well,thanks a lot for
the angelic assistance.

423
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:52,394
You know,I almost got my
heart ripped out of my chest.

424
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:54,624
But you didn't.

425
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,464
I thought angels were
supposed to be guardians.

426
00:35:57,494 --> 00:35:59,724
Fluffy
wings,halos --

427
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:03,994
You know,michael landon. Not dicks.

428
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:07,594
Read the bible.

429
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:11,694
Angels are warriors
of god. I'm a soldier.

430
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:12,994
Yeah? Then,why didn't you fight?

431
00:36:13,064 --> 00:36:17,064
I'm not here to perch
on your shoulder.

432
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,564
We had larger concerns.

433
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:21,764
Concerns?

434
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:23,764
There were people getting
torn to shreds down here!

435
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:25,924
And,by the way,while
all this is going on,

436
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:29,124
Where the hell is your
boss,huh,if there is a god?

437
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:30,924
There's a god.

438
00:36:30,994 --> 00:36:32,224
I'm not convinced.

439
00:36:32,294 --> 00:36:35,324
'Cause if there's a god,

440
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,264
What the hell is he waiting for,huh?

441
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:40,124
Genocide? Monsters roaming the earth?

442
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:41,524
The freaking apocalypse?

443
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:43,724
At what point does
he lift a damn finger

444
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:46,494
And help the poor bastards
that are stuck down here?

445
00:36:46,564 --> 00:36:48,664
-The lord works
- If you say "mysterious ways,"

446
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,494
So help me,I will kick your ass.

447
00:36:57,294 --> 00:37:00,524
So,Bobby was right...

448
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,894
About the witnesses.

449
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:05,394
... this is some kind of a...

450
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:07,224
Sign of the apocalypse.

451
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:10,664
That's why we're
here. Big things afoot.

452
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,024
Do I want to know
what kind of things?

453
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:16,664
I sincerely doubt
it,but you need to know.

454
00:37:16,664 --> 00:37:21,364
The rising of the witnesses
is one of the 66 seals.

455
00:37:21,424 --> 00:37:23,664
Okay. I'm guessing that's
not a show at seaworld.

456
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:27,994
Those seals are being
broken by lilith.

457
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:33,594
She did the spell.
She rose the witnesses.

458
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:35,924
Mm-Hmm. And not just here.

459
00:37:35,994 --> 00:37:39,324
-20 other hunters are dead.
-Of course.

460
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:41,424
She picked victims that
the hunters couldn't save

461
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:43,224
So that they would
barrel right after us.

462
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,064
Lilith has a certain sense of humor.

463
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:47,694
Well,we put those
spirits back to rest.

464
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:50,264
It doesn't matter.
The seal was broken.

465
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:52,324
Why break the seal anyway?

466
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:55,824
You think of the seals
as locks on a door.

467
00:37:55,894 --> 00:37:58,494
... okay. Last one opens and...

468
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:05,664
Lucifer walks free.

469
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,264
Lucifer?

470
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:14,624
But I thought lucifer
was just a story they told

471
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:17,564
At demon sunday school.

472
00:38:17,624 --> 00:38:18,994
There's no such thing.

473
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:22,094
Three days ago,you thought
there was no such thing as me.

474
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:28,224
Why do you think we're
here walking among you now

475
00:38:28,294 --> 00:38:29,694
For the first time in 2,000 years?

476
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:33,694
To stop lucifer.

477
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:37,524
That's why we've arrived.

478
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:44,324
Well... bang-Up job so far.

479
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:46,224
Stellar work with the witnesses.

480
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:47,624
That's nice.

481
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:52,942
We tried.

482
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:56,882
And there are other
battles,other seals.

483
00:38:56,952 --> 00:38:59,082
Some we'll win,some we'll lose.

484
00:38:59,152 --> 00:39:00,652
This one we lost.

485
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:08,422
Our numbers are not unlimited.

486
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:13,282
Six of my brothers died
in the field this week.

487
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,852
You think the armies of heaven

488
00:39:15,922 --> 00:39:18,352
Should just follow you around?

489
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:22,782
There's a bigger picture here.

490
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:28,622
You should show me some respect.

491
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:31,622
I dragged you out of hell.

492
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:34,522
I can throw you back in.

493
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:57,549
You all right?

494
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,979
What's wrong,Dean?

495
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,979
So...

496
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,589
You got no problem believing in...

497
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:08,819
God and angels?

498
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:12,249
No,not really.

499
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,979
So,I guess that means that
you believe in the devil.

500
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,419
Why are you asking me all this?
