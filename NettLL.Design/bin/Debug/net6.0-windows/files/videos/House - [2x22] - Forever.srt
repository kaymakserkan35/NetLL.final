Yeah, I'm just fighting off

buys me enough alcohol

might be weakened.

He wants us to take a Iook.

Unless Chase broke his neck
falling off his polo pony,

00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,403
he had no reason
to be in the ER.

69

Cuddy put him on a two-week
NICU rotation. Patient had
an unexplained seizure.

70

How are you coming along?
Tell her everything's great.

79
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,685
Neither of us wants
to deal with her guilt.
I don't feel guilty.

80
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,655
Of course not.
Hell, if people felt guilt

81
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,692
every time they accidentally
Iobotomized a guy...

82
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,420
I was trying to save his Iife.

83
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,894
Yeah. Your heart
was in the right place.

84
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,357
It's just his brain
that's not quite where
it's supposed to be.

85
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,999
Tell her
everything's great.
It's true.

86
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,532
No more Ieft side/right side
reversals. Still some
short-term memory Ioss

87
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,774
and spatial processing
problems, but I'm trying
not to be too hard on myself.

88
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,744
Yeah, might pull a muscle.

89
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,076
We have a case?
Seizure that can't be
explained by epilepsy

90
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,053
and accompanied
by elevated calcium Ievels.

91
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,989
Still bored.
Tell her why.

92
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:03,495
Because seizure with
mildly elevated calcium
is diagnostically simple.

93
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,499
It's either hyperparathyroid,
cancer, or calcium-mediated
neurotoxicity.

94
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,560
Well done.

95
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,470
But until you can remember
how to make coffee,
hands off the patients.

96

House.

97
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,368
AII those reasons this case
bores you, the ER has
already ruled them out.

98
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,518
Lungs are clear. Get an EEG.
Confirm the brain function
is okay.

99
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,186
Can we focus
on the task at hand?

100
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,523
Why did Mommy twitch so hard
that she tossed the baby
in with the bath water?

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,728
You don't need me for this.
Of course I need you.
We're a team.

102
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,466
Polyarteritis nodosa.
Inflamed arteries in the
brain cause seizures.

103
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,270
Inflamed arteries
in the kidneys
cause calcium buildup.

104
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,245
You're a moron.
Did you even Iook at the file?
Kidney function is fine.

105
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,076
Whipple's?
What?

106
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,382
Whipple's.
Test her.

107
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,283
Cameron thinks
it starts with a "W".
I'm thinking "V".

108
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,725
The dad vomited
this morning. Maybe
they've both got strep.

109
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,385
You think you can
do a strep-throat culture

110
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,656
without the swab ending up
in the guy's poop chute?

111
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,130
"V" for "vasoconstriction."
That'd be my guess.

112
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,531
Excess calcium
makes blood vessels
in the brain clamp down.

113
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,468
Best case scenario, seizure.
Worst case, stroke.

114
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,870

from down, Cameron's a girl.

Special panties
for your date with Wilson?

121
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,307
It's not a date. And it's
none of your business.

122
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,279
If it's not a date,
it is business.

123
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,044
And if it was business,
you wouldn't say it was
none of my business.

124

What do you want?
I want to talk about
your date with Wilson.

125

It's not a date.
This is fun.

126
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:13,050
Spring Chase from NICU
and I'II shut up
about your date.

127
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,185
NICU is short-staffed.
Have you suddenly
Iost the ability to Iie?

128
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,430
Nobody's quit NICU
in two years.

129
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,462
And if you're making up reasons,
that means there is no reason,

130
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,072
which means he asked
for the assignment,
didn't he?

131
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,110
If Chase needs
a break from you,
he should take it.

132
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,108
Absolutely.

133

I'm fine.
You don't have to say that.

136
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,305
It's okay. I could always work
in a research Iab or teach.

137
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,975
And you'd be okay with that?
Why wouldn't I be?

pursuing grants of your own,
running a department.

00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,953
Let the indulging
commence.

167
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,519
Lithium could cause all three
of the mother's symptoms.

168
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,118
No record she's on Iithium.
And the tox screen
was negative.

169
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,824
Lithium doesn't show
on a basic tox screen,
Scarecrow.

170
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,766
Myelomatous meningitis
could also cover everything.

171
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,262
Rare complications
of a rare blood cancer.
You're not totally hopeless.

172
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,331
Get an S-PEP
and an MRI for
myelomatous meningitis.

173
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,138
Search the patient's place
for Iithium.

174
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,374
The baby's Iung problem
is bacterial and not chemical.
Start ECMO.

175
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:59,441
While you're searching
for the Iithium, take a water
sample and check the pipes.

176
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,884
You want me to write
this down for you?

177
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,458
I ask you, is almost dying
any excuse for not being fun?

178
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,788
I'm not putting
that baby on ECMO.

179
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,198
The chance of there
being bacteria in bathwater...

180
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,395
Why don't you want
to work for me?

181
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,865
I'm nice,
I'm fun at parties.

182
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,366
I'm not working NICU
because of you.

183
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,479
The baby's x-ray suggested
chemical pneumonitis.

184
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,949
Not to me. The x-ray
was too consolidated.

185
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:36,085
So, why are you down here?
Hoping to expand
your make-out pool

186
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,056
to include the preemie
to nine-year-old demographic?

187
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,594
I needed a break.

188
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,864
From the patients.

189
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,399
They Iie to us
all the time.

190
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,396
Foreman almost died
trying to save
a drug-dealing cop.

191
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,505
I just wanted to get away
from that for a while.

192
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,913
What a complete Ioad of crap.

193
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,350
What am I?
A nurse you're trying to prep
with this vulnerability thing?

194
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,981
ECMO could kill him.

195
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,286
You don't start him on ECMO
and that infection could
rampage through his body

196
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,725
Iike Pistons fans
after a championship.

197
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,328
But you do it your way.
Nothing more honest
than a dead baby.

198
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,566
ECMO stands
for extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation.

199
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,269
Basically, we remove
your son' s blood...
Okay, all of his blood?

200
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,712
We run it through a machine
which takes out carbon dioxide
and adds oxygen.

201
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,944
Then we re-warm the blood
and run it back into his body.

202
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:44,252
There is a significant risk
of internal hemorrhaging,
and he may also suffer...

203
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,121
You put him on antibiotics.
Won't that take care
of the infection?

204
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,558
Not fast enough.

205
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,095
Are you sure this is
Mikey's best shot?

206
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,228
Absolutely.

207
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,860
Cuddy's trash?
Not anymore.
I paid good money for it.

208
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,427
Look at what she bought.

209
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,000
Red clover.
What is red clover
used for, Dr. Wilson?

210
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,970
AIso used to treat asthma,

211
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:41,475
psoriasis, joint pain...
She doesn't wheeze,
flake, or ache.

212
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,742
And she didn't ask
a pulmonologist or a
dermatologist for dinner.

213
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,748
She invited an oncologist.

214
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,914
It's not a date.
It's a consult.

215
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,793
Mom's MRI was negative
for masses, abscesses.

216
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,853
There's no sign
she has myelomatous...
Fascinating.

217
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,991
Call me when we have...
She has a subarachnoid bleed.

218
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,631
So, why is our patient
bleeding into her brain?

219
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,138
Her blood workup shows
her pro-time's elevated.

220
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:12,007
She's bleeding because
she's not clotting.
So, why is she not clotting?

221
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,135
What did you
bring us, Daddy?

222
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,909
The only mood-altering
drug was vodka at
the back of a drawer.

223
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,544
Hiding booze is a classic
alcoholic behavior.
That'd explain the bleeding.

224
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,677
What bleeding?

225
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,281
You don't remember?
She bled all over you
this morning. Kidding.

226
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,424
Idiots are fun. No wonder
every village wants one.

227
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,455
If she's an alcoholic,
she would also be more
prone to hypercalcemia.

228
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:36,262
But the tox screen
was negative for alcohol.
Hey, it was your idea.

229
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,429
Now, it's even better.
Mommy quits.
She gets the DTs.

230
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,531
Even explains the seizure.
It also fits
conversion disorder.

231
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,066
They're deep in debt,
he' s working around the
clock, they got a new baby.

232
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,943
I think the seizure
was a physical response
to psychological stress.

233
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,982
Boozy Mommy
covers more symptoms.

234
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,451
Put her in a nice
phenobarbital coma
before the DTs kill her.

235
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,680
Where are you going?
To put her in a pheno coma.

236
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,658
What if I'm wrong?
What if Daddy's the drunk?

237
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,354
Do you want us to give her
the pheno or not?

238
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,555
I want him
to argue his point.

239
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,723
I assume you considered
the father and ruled him out.

240
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,166
What's that saying?
When you assume, you become
a pain in the ass to me.

241
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,294
Why should I argue?
You'd just overrule me.

242
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,102
Enough! Get a pony
or a watermelon farm.

243
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,006
House?
I need him to react.

244
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,704
I need him to act
Iike a human being.

245
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,043
I need him to
get over this boring
near-death rebirth.

246
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,573
I have changed. That's not
something you get over.

247
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,383
Nearly dying changes
everything forever.
For about two months.

248
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,717
Two months is too Iong.
I need the guy
I hired back. Now.

249
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,421
No matter how much your
misery Ioves company,
it's not getting mine.

250
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,396
I'II talk to the dad.
Cameron can take the mom.

251
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,025
We'II figure out
if Mom was the drinker.
Waste of time.

252
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,626
Put her in a coma
before the DTs kill her.

253
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,613
So,

254
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,254
is this a separation, or...

255
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,862
Well, Iawyers
have been hired,
friends divvied up.

256
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,628
Oddly, she didn't
fight me for House.

257
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,758
(CHUCKLES)

258
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,129
At Ieast there aren't kids
involved. You just have
each other to deal with.

259
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,141
If there had been kids,
maybe we would have
done more of that.

260
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,347
Do you want kids?

261
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,750
Listen, is there anything
in particular you wanted to...

262
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,088
Hospital business or...
Catching up.

263
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,187
(CHUCKLES)

264
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,490
I mean, you know,
it's not Iike

265
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,055
either one of us has
anybody to run home to.

266
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,026
No.

267
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,904
How are you feeling?

268
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,314
Okay. A Iittle groggy.

269
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,947
There's somebody here
to see you.

270
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,792
BRENT: Hey, Mikey.
Mommy's awake.

271
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:25,630
Oh, Mikey.
Gosh, I was so scared.

272
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,103
(WHIMPERING)

273
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,530
Oh, I Iove you.

274
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,109
I Iove you so much. Oh.

275
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,439
(SHUSHING)

276
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,542
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,585
You don't have anything
to be sorry about.
You were sick.

278
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,362
Turns out she and
her husband met in AA.

279
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,836
Obviously, she slipped.
Good call.

280
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:04,239
It wasn't hard,
considering my other choice
was your stupid psych theory.

281
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,502
Which was not stupid.

282
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,144
I'm telling you, I'm gonna
drop the N-bomb if I have to.

283
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,912
You're addicted to conflict.
Did they change the name?

284
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,684
You could have
handled this patient
without dragging Chase in.

285
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,782
But the fact that
he didn't want in killed you.

286
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,692
Just Iike the fact
you can't get
a rise out of me.

287
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,865
Where's the baby?

288
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,472
(GRUNTING)

289
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,412
Get off me! No!
I have to do this!

290
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,972
No breath sounds.
Crash cart and epi! Stat!

291
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,044
I told you your psych theory
wasn't stupid.

292
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,788
Your son is stable.

293
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,158
But the Iack of oxygen
damaged his kidneys.

294
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,754
She must have rolled
over on him by mistake.

295
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,066
Mr. Mason,
I was there.

296
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,398
Your wife tried
to smother your son.

297
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,500
That's impossible.
Kara would never hurt Mikey.

298
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,443
He knows.
They said Mikey knows.

299
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:22,981
You hear voices?

300
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,456
They wouldn't quit saying
that Mikey would be
better off if...

301
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,126
They were right.

302
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,128
We've been trying
to diagnose a seizure
that didn't exist.

303
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,171
She faked it when
her husband caught her.
I don't think she faked it.

304
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,265
She just happened to seize
right in the middle of
drowning her child?

305
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,434
Lucky break for the kid.

306
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:48,639
Hey, take it easy on Foreman.
He's playing with one Iobe
tied behind his back.

307
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,080
Postpartum psychosis makes her
want to drown her kid.

308
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,844
The internal conflict
triggers a seizure.

309
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,979
You know what else might be
a trigger? A physical illness.
It's a wild idea, I know.

310
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,649
Especially since she
doesn't have any obviously
physical symptoms,

311
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,593
Iike internal bleeding
or excess calcium.
I'II draw some blood,
test for...

312
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:07,530
Oh! Jeez!
You've done it again!
Will you argue with me?

313
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,732
Drinkers don't eat right.
That explains the bleeding
and the calcium.

314
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,167
This might just be
some crazy drunk,

315
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,070
and I'm telling you that
she's about to die of
myelomatous meningitis.

316
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,734
We already tested for...
Exactly. It's an insane idea.

317
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,108
Okay. What do you
want me to do?
Have an original thought.

318
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,307
In the meantime,
stress her into having
another seizure.

319
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,112
We can't.
She's on haloperidol.

320
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,381
You also can't
because it's dangerous
and highly unethical.

321
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,718
Therefore, if you
get caught, pretend
you can't make coffee.

322
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,985
Mental defectives
get tons of slack.

323
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,119
Take her off the haloperidol,
hook her up to an EEG,

324
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,597
flash some Iights,
make her pant,
shoot her up with a placebo.

325
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,830
When she starts twitching,
if the machine twitches along,
it's real. If not,

326
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,736
well, call the cops,
'cause she's a psycho killer.

327
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,076
Stop pushing him.
Stop protecting him.

328
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,548
He needs it.
Not if he wants
to get better.

329
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,814
He might not be able
to get better.
Well, then, I need
a new neurologist.

330
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:02,911
He got sick doing his job.

331
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,446
If he got killed
doing his job, I wouldn't
keep him on the payroll.

332
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,393
I don't care how guilty
you feel or how touched
you are by his reborn spirit.

333
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,089
I am not touched.
Then you're guilt-ridden.

334
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,064
I'm not guilt-ridden.
Then you're pathetic.

335
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,190
Right now, I'm annoyed.

336
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,666
Keeping him up all night
in the seizure Iab

337
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,999
is not the way
to advance his recovery.
It's too much.

338
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,163
You're right.

339
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,298
You should stick around.
Make sure he doesn't screw up.

340
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,378
FOREMAN: Kara, look directly
into the light.

341
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,449
Keep Iooking.

342
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,889
Thought you'd be
gone for the day.

343
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,860
Thought I'd wait for the
bone marrow biopsy results.

344
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,194
House sent you
to baby-sit me, didn't he?
He asked me
to wait for the results.

345
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,530
Cameron, it's fine.
Of course it is.

346
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,505
Look, a few weeks ago,
you were upset that I didn't
consider you a friend.

347
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,668
Now you're upset
that I'm happy?

348
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,244
What can I say?
Apparently, I'm a bitch.

349
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,246
I didn't say that.

350
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,406
It's annoying.

351
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,973
Insisting every day
of your Iife is a blessing

352
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,417
is basically calling
everyone else shallow.

353
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,182
It gets old.
Sorry.

354
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,389
Oh, give it a rest.

355
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,993
How was dinner?

356
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,865
Cuddy did not
mention cancer.

357
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,793
She Iost her nerve.
It was a date.

358
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,472
What are you doing?
PCR test.

359
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,113
You're doing it yourself
in the middle of the night.

360
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,908
On a spoon.

361
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,347
Cuddy's spoon.
I'm checking her saliva
for cancer markers.

362
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,916
Yeah. I do that
after all my dates, too.

363
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,997
People think
you're the nice one.
Why are you so worried
about Cuddy?

364
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,595
You go first. You desperately
want this to be a date.

365
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,798
Because the alternative
is cancer.

366
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,103
Just admit that you Iike her.

367
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,111
She's smart, funny,
got a zesty bod.

368
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,743
I think it's great you can
Iook beyond the fact
she's the devil.

369
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,216
I stole a spoon.
You stole her garbage.

370
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,547
She's my boss.

371
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,912
If she gets sick, the
hospital might replace her,
especially if she dies.

372
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,421
I'd have to Iearn
how to manipulate someone new.

373
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,420
Whoa.

374
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,522
I think I'm gonna cry.

375
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,991
Find me when
the results come in.

376
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,569
Mr. Mason,

377
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,875
because of the damage
done to your son's kidneys,
his potassium is climbing.

378
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,144
That's causing
irregular heartbeats.

379
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,218
I'm doubling the meds
and starting him on dialysis.

380
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,983
But unless we get
his potassium down,

381
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,250
he's gonna have
a heart attack.

382
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,922
Kara, just another
few minutes.

383
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,367
Biopsy's back. She's negative
for myelomatous meningitis.

384
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,663
And she's not seizing.

385
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,167
So, we're wrong
and House is wrong.
And you're okay with that?

386
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,636
(BEEPING)

387
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,974
She's seizing.

388
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,679
She's not doing anything.

389
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,115
Her brain activity
isn't accelerating,
it's slowing down.

390
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,820
(SUCKING)

391
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,960
Muscle rigidity,
involuntary grasping
and sucking motions.

392
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,191
She's in an
encephalopathic delirium.

393
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,392
Hmm.

394
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,933
A genuine
physiological illness.
That rules out a few things.

395
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,063
Like what, I wonder?

396
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:44,006
Postpartum psychosis
and conversion disorder.

397
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,044
The thing about being
a good Ioser,
you're still a Ioser.

398
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,204
Ouch.

399
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,776
The delirium means
her brain is shutting down,

400
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,646
reverting to its most
instinctual functions.

401
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,948
And since it's progressing,
I think we can assume
it's progressive,

402
00:25:56,021 --> 00:26:00,185
which means it won't be
Iong before the brain
closes shop altogether. Ideas?

403
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,017
(ALARM BEEPING)

404
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,695

His potassium's
still too high.

00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,995

Still in V-fib.

409

Another amp of epi.

410
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,578
Chase shouldn't be
wasting his time in NICU.

411
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,721
Could be Wernicke's.

412
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:38,252
No. Treatment for Wernicke's
is thiamine. We gave her
that together with the pheno.

413
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,155
Delirium points to Iithium.
I know we didn't' t find any,
but...

414
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,496
She'd have to be smuggling
it in to be getting sicker.

415
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,060
Whipple's causes
encephalopathic delirium.
The test was negative.

416
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,369
The test could have
been wrong.
Ideas are not soda cans.

417
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:54,869
Recycling sucks.
Give me something
new and shiny.

418
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:59,815
Or go retro. Take an old idea,
shine it up, and add
a new symptom.

419
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,015
Encephalopathic delirium.

420
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,619
Pellagra.

421
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:09,118
She drinks.
AIcoholics get pellagra.

422
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,594
They eat Iousy diets,
so no niacin.

423
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,791
He agrees with me.
What a shock.
Well, you're right.

424
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,664
Lack of niacin starves
the brain. Neurons shut down.

425
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,671
Causes seizures,
encephalopathic delirium
and psychosis.

426
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,969
We give Kara niacin, she'II
come out of her delirium

427
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,508
and she'II be totally sane.

428
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,136
Don't think she's ever
gonna be sane again.

429
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,813
Her son just died.

430
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,477
How do you feel?

431
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,240

433

My stomach kinda hurts.

434
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,349
I need to ask you
some questions,
see how you're doing.

435
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,619
Mmm-hmm.

436
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,660
Tell me your name.

437
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,624
Kara Mason. Is my son here?

438
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,867
When were you born?

439
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,495
PIease. Where's Michael?
Is he okay?

440
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,733
Do you hear any other voices
besides mine?

441
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,503
No. Answer me.

442
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,741
You've been suffering
from delusions.

443
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,746
They were caused
by a vitamin deficiency,
pellagra.

444
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,811
It made you believe things
that were not real.

445
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,586
Like the voices.

446
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,518
I

447
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,859
remember doing things
to Mikey.

448
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,769
Were those real?

449
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,237
I'm afraid so.

450
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,876
So, I...

451
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,945
You tried to suffocate
your son.
But...

452
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,123
You... You stopped me.

453
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,187
And

454
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,956
that other doctor,
he got Mikey breathing.

455
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,794
Your son's organs
were damaged too severely.

456
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,273
He passed away this morning.

457
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,642
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

458
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,185
No!

Oh, my God! No! Oh, my God!

FOREMAN: Pellagra doesn't
cause bloody vomit.

461
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,829
She's still sick
and getting worse.

462
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:08,362
So what causes pellagra
and crimson spew?

463
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:14,905
Dead baby, while sad,
not our problem.
I should have given him
more polystyrene.

464
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,812
You killed him.
If you don't get over it,
you're gonna kill Mama, too.

465
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,181
Her alcoholism caused
the pellagra. Maybe it also
explains the vomiting.

466
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,743
Gastritis.
Gastritis meds
aren't helping,

467
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,519
which may confirm her story.
She only slipped once.

468
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,218
You remove drinking
from the equation,

469
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,194
internal bleeding,
hypercalcemia, seizure,
and pellagra are all back in.

470

Chase, will you get your head
out of the dead baby's butt

471
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,532
and focus on the barely alive?

472
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,565
How much polystyrene
did you give the kid?

473
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,731
One gram.

just kept rising.

475
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,759
I need your son.

476
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,825
Who are you?

477
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,569
Your wife's doctor.
Your son may have had the
same condition she does.

478
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,630
My son didn't have
a condition. She killed him.

479
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,469
If I biopsy her intestine,
she'II bleed out.

480
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:25,707
He obviously won't.
You're not using my
son's body to help her.

481
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,084
Okay. How about trading him
for a beer?

482
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,589
Or maybe you're more
of a whiskey guy.

483
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,259
You didn't have strep
or a stomach bug
the morning you came in.

484
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,595
You puked because
you were hung over.

485
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,132
Accuse a recovered drunk
of slipping and most of
the time, you'II be right.

486
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,331
So I drink.

487
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,865
You're acting Iike
this is my fault.
People are gonna
feel sorry for you,

488
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,139
and they'II tell you that
you can't anticipate
the unthinkable.

489
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,272
The fact is, you can.

490
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,040
It's just not
all that pleasant.

491
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,209
Look, you don't know
anything about...

492
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,412
I know that people
don't get crazy enough
to kill someone

493
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,547
without first being
crazy enough
for someone to notice.

494
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:09,284
How many times
did you go out for a drink
because she was crying?

495
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,193
How many times
did you stay at work

496
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,720
because you couldn't Iisten
to her telling you
what a bad mother she is?

497
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,267
You were relieved
when she shut down

498
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,796
and just sat staring
for hours at a time.

499
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,941
She held the pillow
over his head. You slept
while she went nuts.

500
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,278
Not exactly a draw, but...
What is wrong with you?

501
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,172
What kind of a person
says those things now?

502
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,285
Let me do the test.

503
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,889
It'II be one Iess thing
for you to feel crappy about.

504
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,231
I got a dead baby
for you to biopsy.

505
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,227
Let Cameron do it.
Love working NICU?

506
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:59,406
I could get you transferred.
I told you. I just wanted
to trust patients.

507
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,741
You don't give a crap
about patients.

508
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,012
Your paycheck.

509
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,184
You've been double-dipping.

510
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:15,080
Taking your vacation time
here, while drawing
a salary in NICU.

511
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,189
Strange.
Rich boy doing all that
for some extra cash.

512
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:25,601
I'm not rich.
But your dad was.
Now he's dead.

513
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,372
If you're not rich,
that means that
Daddy cut you out.

514
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,936
I'm not rich.

515
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,306
Don't Iet it change you.

516
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,347
And do the test.

517
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,829
God of compassion,
take Michael into your arms

518
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,838
and welcome him into paradise.

519
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:09,112
Let there be no sorrow,
no weeping, and no pain.

520
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,478
Peace and joy forevermore.

521
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:18,881
I'm sorry.

522
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,141
It was a date.
Cuddy's negative
for all cancer markers.

523
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,347
It was a date.

524
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,090
The baby's intestine
shows slight
villous atrophy.

525
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,296
Why would a baby
have flattened villi?

526
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,659
He was being treated
with polystyrene.

527
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,932
Polystyrene shouldn't...
It didn't.

528
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,970
The question is,
what do they use in the NICU
to bind it together?

529
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,068
Wheat gluten.
It's great stuff.

530
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,506
Unless your body
can't tolerate it.

531
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,945
The baby didn't have colic?
He had celiac disease?

532
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,279
Just Iike Mom.

533
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,782
Celiac can be triggered
by all kinds of stress.

534
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,054
Bills, childbirth,
drunk husband...

535
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:33,029
Every time she had a bowl
of pasta or a slice of bread
or a slosh of soy sauce,

536
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,429
her small intestine became
more damaged,

537
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,731
Iess able to absorb
the vitamins and minerals
into her bloodstream.

538
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,795
Her body couldn't
absorb enough niacin,
caused the pellagra.

539
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,171
Couldn't absorb vitamin K,
caused the bleeding.

540
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,268
And celiac is why
the baby's meds didn't work.

541
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,508
His body just couldn't
absorb them.

542
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:57,611
Switch Mom to IV nutrition.
It's gluten-free. That'II
spruce her villi right up.

543
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:02,182
No. Celiac causes nutritional
deprivation. Our patient
has excess calcium.

544
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,026
Tell them what causes
excess calcium with
a chaser of bloody vomit.

545
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,826
Celiac patients
are susceptible to cancer
of the stomach Iining.

546
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,197
She has MALT Iymphoma.
Well, she's your patient, now.

547
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,766
And it wasn't a date.

548
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,819
You don't have cancer.
You don't have dwarfism.

549
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,519
You have no proof of that.
I, on the other hand,
have this.

550
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,431
You ran a PCR on me
without my consent?

551
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,592
Hey, it's good news.
Really?

552
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:48,071
It's just hard to access
because of this overwhelming
sense of personal violation.

553
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,965
Deal with it
on your own time.

554
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,299
Bad news.

555
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,340
Estrogen is too high.

556
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,314
No matter how many people
you tell otherwise,

557
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,840
I am and always have
been a woman.
Estrogen is normal.

558
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,150
Not this much.
Not for, at Ieast,
another week.

559
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,652
That's when you ovulate.

560
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,819
You monitor my periods

561
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,160
based on when
I get bitchy or...

562
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:20,970
Once a month, when you Ieave
the kids' cancer ward,
your eyes glisten.

563
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,238
And about three days Iater,
you break your ban on sugar

564
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:28,642
and chow down a bucket
of frozen yogurt in the
cafeteria. Sprinkles included.

565
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,779
Based on the Iast yogurt
sighting, you've got another
week before you ovulate.

566
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,615
You're on fertility meds.

567
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,816
With red clover
as an herbal booster.

568
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,596
And the dinner with Wilson
was an audition.

569
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,064
It's too bad he
didn't Iand the gig.
He would have had fun.

570
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,102
I was considering a donation.
Not a party.

571
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,108
So when's our dinner?

572
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,909
(WILSON TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

573
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,444
Oh, he's gonna be
so disappointed.
Right.

574
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,448
You two are gonna have
a Iot of fun with this.

575
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,385
Your patient won't Iet me
touch her.

576
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,032
I killed my son.

577
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,398
Is it my turn to say
something obvious now?

578
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,674
Oh, I know. You were insane.

579
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,145
I did it.
I chose to do it.

580
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:40,206
Yeah. Like diabetics choose
to not produce insulin.

581
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,887
Listen. Someone got sick.
Someone died.

582
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,181
It happens every day.

583
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,496
The only difference
in this case is,
it wasn't the same someone.

584
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,087
I could have stopped.

585
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,966
I didn't have to Iisten
to those voices.

586
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,794
Spoken Iike a true
sane person.

587
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,600
This is not your fault.

588
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,177
You're healthy now.

589
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,038
Except for the cancer.

590
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,207
Those voices felt
as real to me

591
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,177
as Michael's hand

592
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,485
right here, when he nursed,

593
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,286
and the smell of his hair.

594
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,430
You do not deserve to die.

595
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,898
Maybe.

596
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,405
I don't want to Iive.

597
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,023
(DOOR OPENING)

598
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:57,953
She said no.

599
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,326
So we get her
declared unstable,
appoint a medical proxy...

600
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,528
She was unstable.
Now, she's sane. She's
entitled to refuse the treatment.

601
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,593
You have to change her mind.
You can't just walk away.

602
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,730
Fine! Go on in there
and tell her that
every day is a blessing.

603
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,971
"So you killed your baby?
Shake it off. Think positive.
At Ieast you're alive."

604
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,305
Hmm.

605
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,843
Kinda hard to sell when
you don't believe it, huh?

606
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,179
And you never believed it.

607
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,777
You just wanted all that
crap you went through
to mean something.

608
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:27,119
Well, it didn't mean
anything. It never does.
Welcome back.

609
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,321
Why are you
doing this to me?
I was happy.

610
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,492
You were aspiring
to be content.

611
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,558
Don't give me a semantic
argument. I was content
with the way things were.

612
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,160
That's what happiness is.
Yeah.

613
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,764
If we were all just satisfied
with what we had, what a
beautiful world it would be.

614
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,937
We'd all slowly starve
to death in our own filth,
but at Ieast we'd be happy.

615
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,879
Listen. I need your self-worth
to hang on this job.

616
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,044
Kicking ass here to be all
that Iets you rise
above miserable.

617
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,144
If waking up in the morning
is enough, I don't need you.

618
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,745
I can Iive with that.

619
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,259
No, you can't. Not anymore.

620
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,482
If you got treatment,
then maybe we could...

621
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,271
When you see Mikey,

622
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,170
tell him his dad says
he's sorry.

623
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,683
Hi.

624
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,886
Night.
Night.

625
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,600
Did you tell Cuddy
we tested her for cancer?

626
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,330
Yeah.
And?

627
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,637
It wasn't a date.

628
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:29,177
Turned out she had
some skin Iesions. Guess there
was no genetic predisposition.

629
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,278
You TiVo The L Word?
