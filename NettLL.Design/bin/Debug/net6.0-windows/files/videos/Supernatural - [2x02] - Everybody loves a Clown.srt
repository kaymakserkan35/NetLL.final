1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:02,949
He wants us to pick up
where he left off.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,119
Saving people, hunting things...

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,289
The family business.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,804
Dad.

5
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:11,443
Dean.

6
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,687
It's not a dream.

7
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:14,618
You ever heard of an out-of-body experience?

8
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,021
We're spirits...

9
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:18,332
of people close to death.

10
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:23,103
Your son is dying,
and you're worried about the colt?

11
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:26,446
You shoot me in the heart, son!

12
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:29,688
You're bringing the demon here,
aren't you?

13
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,046
Having some stupid, macho showdown!

14
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,756
If you killed that damn thing
when you had the chance,

15
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:36,792
none of this would have happened.

16
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,835
I want to make a deal.

17
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:48,416
You're much prettier
than the last reaper I met.

18
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:51,731
I will give you the colt and the bullet.
But you got to help Dean.

19
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:54,677
So, we have a deal?

20
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:57,362
You still need to sweeten the pot.

21
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:01,505
Today is your lucky day, kid.

22
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:05,668
You watch out for Sammy, okay?

23
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,080
Okay.

24
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:15,949
Dad?

25
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:21,569
Time of death, 10:41 a.m.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,451
God, I hate clowns.
Always creep me out.

27
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:50,943
Shh! She likes them.

28
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:01,311
Last ride, Nora.

29
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,261
Look, mom, another clown.

30
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,564
What are you trying to do,
scare your father?

31
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:24,518
Honey.

32
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:41,820
Look, mom, a clown.

33
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,920
You missed him.

34
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,562
Before he...

35
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,674
Before he...

36
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,897
Did he say anything to you?

37
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,760
About anything?

38
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:00,547
No.

39
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,640
Nothing.

40
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:44,685
How's the car coming along?

41
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:45,574
Slow.

42
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:47,442
Yeah?

43
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:50,409
You need any help?

44
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,892
What?
You under a hood?

45
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:53,564
I'll pass.

46
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,177
Need anything else, then?

47
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:00,621
Stop it, Sam.

48
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:02,205
Stop what?

49
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,493
Stop asking if I need anything.

50
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:06,197
Stop asking if I'm okay.
I'm okay.

51
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,063
Really. I promise.

52
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,357
All right, Dean, it's just...

53
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,702
We've been at Bobby's for over a week now,
and you haven't brought up dad once.

54
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,666
You know what? You're right.

55
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,028
Come here.

56
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,973
I'm gonna lay my head gently
on your shoulder.

57
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:27,131
Maybe we could cry, hug,

58
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,538
- maybe even slow dance.
- Don't patronize me, Dean.

59
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,830
Dad is dead, the colt is gone,
and it seems pretty damn likely

60
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:35,361
that the demon is behind all of this.
And you're acting like nothing happened.

61
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,752
- What do you want me to say?
- Say something, all right?!

62
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:40,128
Hell, say anything!
Aren't you angry? Don't you want revenge?

63
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,359
But all you do is sit out here all day long
buried underneath this damn car.

64
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,275
- Revenge, huh? Sounds good.
- Yeah!

65
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,664
Got any leads on where the demon is?

66
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:50,330
Making heads or tails of any
of dad's research? 'Cause I sure ain't.

67
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:51,924
You know, when we do finally find it...

68
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:52,950
Oh,

69
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,821
no, wait,
like you said, the colt's gone.

70
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,784
But I'm sure you figured out
another way to kill it.

71
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:59,010
We've got nothing, Sam.
Nothing, okay?

72
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:01,741
The only thing I can do is
I can work on the car.

73
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:05,424
Well, we got something, all right?

74
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:07,835
It's what I came out here to tell you.

75
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,242
It's one of dad's old phones.

76
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:12,387
It took me a while, but I cracked
his voice mail code. Listen to this.

77
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:18,566
John, it's Ellen...
Again.

78
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:21,237
Look, don't be stubborn.
You know I can help you. Call me.

79
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,197
That message is four months old.

80
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:25,913
Dad saved that chick's message
for four months?

81
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:27,103
- Yeah.
- Who's Ellen?

82
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:28,701
- Any mention of her in dad's journal?
- No,

83
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:31,146
but I ran a trace on the number,
and I got an address.

84
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:35,527
Ask Bobby if we can use one of his cars.

85
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,263
This is humiliating.

86
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:54,049
I feel like a friggin' soccer mom.

87
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,244
It's the only car Bobby had running.

88
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,397
Hello?

89
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,015
- Anybody here?
- Alright.

90
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,141
- Hey, did you bring the...
- of course.

91
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:35,485
Hey, buddy?

92
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:41,652
- I'm guessing that isn't Ellen.
- Yeah.

93
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,950
Oh, god, please let that be a rifle.

94
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,425
No, I'm just real happy to see you.

95
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,176
- Don't move.
- Not moving. Copy that.

96
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,116
You should know something, miss.

97
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:10,736
When you put a rifle on someone,

98
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:12,942
you don't want to put it
right against their back,

99
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,029
'cause it makes it real easy to do...

100
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:18,645
that!

101
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,957
Sam!

102
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,262
I need some help in here.

103
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:23,961
I can't see. I can't even see!

104
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:24,992
Sorry, Dean.

105
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,475
I can't right now.
I'm a...

106
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:29,290
little tied up.

107
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:33,155
Sam? Dean?

108
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,116
Winchester?

109
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:38,102
Yeah.

110
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:40,082
Son of a bitch.

111
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,320
Mom, you know these guys?

112
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,551
Yeah, I think these are
John Winchester's boys.

113
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:48,175
Hey, I'm Ellen.

114
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:49,379
That's my daughter, Jo.

115
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:51,338
Hey.

116
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,226
You're not gonna hit me again, are you?

117
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:55,379
Here you go.

118
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,284
Thanks.

119
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,226
You called our dad, said you could help.

120
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:02,904
Help with what?

121
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:05,744
Well,

122
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,094
the demon, of course.

123
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,385
I heard he was closing in on it.

124
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,860
Was there an article in
the demon hunter's quarterly that I missed?

125
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,450
I mean, who are you?
How do you know about all this?

126
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,011
Hey, I just run a saloon.

127
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:21,060
But hunters have been known
to pass through now and again,

128
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,018
including your dad a long time ago.

129
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,522
- John was like family once.
- Oh Yeah?

130
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,245
I mean he's never mentioned you before.

131
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,048
You'd have to ask him that.

132
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:33,394
So, why exactly do we need your help?

133
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,447
Hey, don't do me any favors.

134
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:37,018
Look, if you don't want my help, fine.

135
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,116
Don't let the door smack your ass
on the way out.

136
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:40,711
But John wouldn't have sent you if...

137
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:47,611
He didn't send you.

138
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,118
He's all right, isn't he?

139
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:57,691
No.

140
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,448
No, he isn't.

141
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,430
It was the demon, we think.

142
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,789
It just got him before he got it, I guess.

143
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,526
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

144
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:12,915
We're all right.

145
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,788
Really, I know how close you and your dad...

146
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,153
Really, lady, I'm fine.

147
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,119
So, look, if you can help...

148
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:25,729
we could use all the help we can get.

149
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,098
Well, we can't.

150
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:29,574
But Ash will.

151
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:31,433
- Who's Ash?
- Ash!

152
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:34,231
What?

153
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,677
Closing time?

154
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:40,935
That's Ash?

155
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,853
He's a genius.

156
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:47,643
You got to be kidding me.
This guy's no genius.

157
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:49,908
He's a Lynyrd Skynyrd roadie.

158
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,226
- I like You.
- Thanks.

159
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,460
Just give him a chance.

160
00:11:58,156 --> 00:11:59,129
All right.

161
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:03,654
Well, this stuff's about a year's worth
of our dad's work. So

162
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:05,824
let's see what you make of it.

163
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:21,044
Come on. This crap ain't real.
Ain't nobody can track a demon like this.

164
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:26,096
Our dad could.

165
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,375
These are nonparametric
statistical overviews,

166
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,289
cross-spectrum correlations. I mean...

167
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:36,024
Damn!

168
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:38,928
They're signs,

169
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:42,837
omens. If you can track them,
you can track this demon.

170
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:46,614
You know, like crop failures,
electrical storms.

171
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:50,392
You ever been struck by lightning?
It ain't fun.

172
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:54,173
- Can you track it or not?
- Yeah, With This, I think so.

173
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,133
But it's gonna take time.
Give me...

174
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:00,939
51 hours.

175
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,952
- Hey, man!
- Yeah?

176
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,299
By the way, I dig the haircut.

177
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:13,563
All business up front,

178
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,160
party in the back.

179
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,021
Hey, Ellen, what is that?

180
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,506
It's a police scanner.

181
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:35,963
- We keep tabs on things.
- No, No, No, no. the... folder.

182
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,850
I was gonna give this to
a friend of mine, but

183
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,437
take a look

184
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:48,307
if you want.

185
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:50,712
Thanks.

186
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,950
How did your mom get
into this stuff, anyway?

187
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,128
My dad.

188
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,161
He was a hunter.

189
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,704
He passed away.

190
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:01,775
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,394
It was a long time ago.

192
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,512
I was just a kid.

193
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,765
Sorry to hear about yo dad.

194
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,519
Yeah.

195
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,123
So,

196
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,810
I guess I got 51 hours to waste.

197
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,426
Maybe tonight we should...

198
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,185
Oh, you know what? Never mind.

199
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:30,158
- What?
- Nothing, just...

200
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:32,799
Wrong place, wrong time.

201
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,168
I thought you were gonna toss me
some cheap pickup line.

202
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:38,966
Most hunters come through that door,
think they can get in my pants with some

203
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,944
pizza, a six-pack
and side one of "Zeppelin 4".

204
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,937
What a bunch of scumbags.

205
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:47,593
Not you.

206
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,012
I guess not.

207
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:53,395
Dean, come here. Check this out.

208
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:55,899
Yeah.

209
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,563
A few murders not far from here
that Ellen caught wind of.

210
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:02,376
Looks to me like there might be a hunt.

211
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:04,613
- Yeah, so?
- So,

212
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,057
I told her we'd check it out.

213
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,530
You got to be kidding me.
Killer clown?

214
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:12,646
Yeah, he left the daughter unharmed
and killed the parents.

215
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,058
Ripped them to pieces, actually.

216
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,014
And this family was at
some carnival that night?

217
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,538
Right, the Cooper carnival.

218
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,223
How do you know we're not dealing
with some psycho carny in a clown suit?

219
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:25,442
The cops have no leads, and all the
employees were tearing down shop...

220
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:29,287
Alibis all around. Plus the girl said
she saw a clown vanish into thin air.

221
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:32,585
- Cops are saying trauma, of course.
- I know what you're thinking, Sam.

222
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:35,069
Why did it have to be clowns?

223
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,392
Oh, give me a break.

224
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,021
You didn't think I remembered, did you?

225
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:42,562
Come on, you still bust out crying whenever
you see Ronald Mcdonald on the television.

226
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:43,847
At least I'm not afraid of flying.

227
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:46,230
- Planes crash!
- And apparently clowns kill.

228
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:51,916
So, these types of murders,
they ever happen before?

229
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,496
Uh, according to the file, 1981, the

230
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,981
Bunker Brothers Circus.

231
00:15:57,982 --> 00:16:01,790
Same M.O. It happened three different
times, three different locales.

232
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,058
It's weird though. If it is a spirit, it's usually
bound to a specific locale. A house or a town.

233
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,618
How's this one moving from city
to city? Carnival to carnival?

234
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:10,112
Cursed object.

235
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:12,474
Spirit attaches itself
to something, and the

236
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:16,402
- carnival carries It around.
- Great. Paranormal scavenger hunt.

237
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,080
This case was your idea.

238
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:22,481
By the way, why is that?
You were awfully quick to jump on this job.

239
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,667
- So?
- So this is not like you, that's all.

240
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,993
I thought you were hell-bent for
leather on the demon hunt.

241
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:31,339
I don't know. I just think

242
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,510
taking this job, it's what dad
would have wanted us to do.

243
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:36,772
- What dad would have wanted?
- Yeah.

244
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,005
So?

245
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:43,791
Nothing.

246
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,173
Check it out.

247
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:56,404
Evan, look.

248
00:16:57,491 --> 00:17:00,743
- Scary!
- Yeah, dad, scary.

249
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:01,698
What's over here?

250
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:10,721
You know, when I was your age,
this would have scared the pants off me.

251
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,345
Evan.

252
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,129
Hey.

253
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:37,583
What is it?

254
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:40,790
I...

255
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,122
I saw a clown.

256
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:46,122
Don't be afraid of clowns.

257
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:48,368
They're nice. They're your friends.

258
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,475
Okay? Come on.

259
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,101
Dad.

260
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:06,854
Dad!

261
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,842
Evan.

262
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,308
What is it?

263
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:13,409
You were right.

264
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,872
He is my friend.

265
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:41,123
Check it out.

266
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:42,069
Five-O.

267
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,527
Did you get her number?

268
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,148
- More murders?
- Two More last night.

269
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,612
Apparently, they were ripped to shreds,

270
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,350
and they had a little boy with them.

271
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,996
Who fingered a clown.

272
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:22,647
What?

273
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,180
Yes, a clown, who apparently
vanished into thin air.

274
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:28,632
Dean, you know, looking for
a cursed object, it's like

275
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,026
trying to find a needle in a stack
of needles. It could be anything.

276
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:35,989
Well, it's bound to give off EMF.
So we'll just have to scan everything.

277
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,432
Oh, good. That's nice and inconspicuous.

278
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:42,384
I guess we'll just have to blend in.

279
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:55,055
Excuse me.

280
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:57,501
We're looking for a Mr. Cooper.
Have you seen him around?

281
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:59,178
What is that? Some kind of joke?

282
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,078
- Oh, god, I'm sorry.
- You think I wouldn't give my eyeteeth

283
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,511
to see Mr. Cooper or a sunset
or anything at all?

284
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:10,727
Want to give me a little help here?

285
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:11,649
Not really.

286
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,570
Hey, Barry, is there a problem?

287
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:18,314
- Yeah, This guy hates blind people.
- No, I don't.

288
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:21,305
- Hey, buddy, what's your problem?
- Nothing. It's just a little misunderstanding.

289
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:22,282
Little?

290
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:24,163
- You son of A bitch.
- No, no, no!

291
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,422
Could somebody tell me where Mr. Cooper is?

292
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:28,103
Please?

293
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,367
You boys picked a hell of a time to join up.

294
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:31,632
Take a seat.

295
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,622
We got all kinds of local trouble.

296
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,637
What do you mean?

297
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:41,619
A couple of folks got themselves murdered.
Cops always seem to start here first.

298
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,169
So, you two ever work the circuit before?

299
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,335
Uh, yes, sir.
Last year through Texas and Arkansas.

300
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:48,904
Doing what?

301
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,056
Ride jockeys?

302
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:52,031
Pull shoot?

303
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,046
- A-and-S men?
- Yeah, it's a...

304
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,537
little bit of everything, I guess.

305
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,194
You two have never worked a show
in your lives before, have you?

306
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:04,217
Nope.

307
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:06,378
But we really need the work.

308
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:10,288
And Sam here's got a thing
for the bearded lady.

309
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:15,879
You see that picture?

310
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,485
That's my daddy.

311
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,642
You look just like him.

312
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:20,879
He was in the business.

313
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:24,620
Ran a freak show
'til they outlawed them most places.

314
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:27,987
Apparently displaying the
deformed isn't dignified.

315
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:31,287
So, most of the performers went
from honest work to rotting in

316
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,153
hospitals and asylums.

317
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,570
That's progress,

318
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:37,029
I guess.

319
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,799
You see, this place

320
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,737
is a refuge for outcasts.

321
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:44,225
Always has been.

322
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:46,426
For folks that don't fit in nowhere else.

323
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:49,122
But you two...

324
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,833
you should go to school,

325
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:54,983
find a couple of girls,

326
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,882
have 2.5 kids,

327
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,366
live regular.

328
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:03,658
Sir...

329
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,463
We don't want to go to school.

330
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:09,068
And we don't want regular.

331
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:11,122
We want this.

332
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:14,187
Hmm.

333
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:16,004
What?

334
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:20,235
That whole, I don't want
to go back to school thing,

335
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:21,009
you just...

336
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:24,187
You were just saying that
to Cooper, or were you,

337
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:25,070
you know,

338
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:25,947
saying it?

339
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:29,553
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

340
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:32,578
I thought that once the demon was dead

341
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,081
and the fat lady sings that you were gonna
take off, head back to wussy state.

342
00:22:36,082 --> 00:22:37,350
I'm having second thoughts.

343
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,662
- Really?
- Yeah, I think...

344
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:42,967
Dad would have wanted me
to stick to the job.

345
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:45,122
Since when do you give
a damn what dad wanted?

346
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:47,241
You spent half your life doing
exactly what he didn't want.

347
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,916
Since he died, okay?

348
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:52,138
You have a problem with that?

349
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:56,724
No, I don't have a problem at all.

350
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,285
Who is this?

351
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:35,926
- Hello?
- Hey, man.

352
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:38,515
What's the matter?
You sound like you just saw a clown.

353
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,116
Very funny.

354
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,397
Skeleton, actually.

355
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:46,796
- Like a real human skeleton?
- In the fun house.

356
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:48,243
Listen, I was thinking.
What if

357
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:51,248
the spirit isn't attached to a cursed object.
What if it's attached to its own remains.

358
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:53,509
- Did the bones give off EMF?
- Well, No, but...

359
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,461
We should check it out anyway.
I'm heading to you.

360
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:00,000
What are you doing here, kid?

361
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,456
- Just sweeping.
- Bull.

362
00:25:03,457 --> 00:25:06,122
And what were you talking about?
Skeletons?

363
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:07,699
What's EMF?

364
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,946
Dude, your blind-man
hearing is out of control.

365
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:13,034
We're a tight-knit group.
We don't like outsiders.

366
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,393
We take care of our own problems.

367
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:18,388
- We got a problem?
- You tell me. You're the one

368
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:20,667
talking about human bones.

369
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,770
Do you believe in ghosts?

370
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:26,251
What?

371
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:27,311
My brother and me...

372
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:30,535
we're writing a book about them.

373
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,152
What took you so long?

374
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:37,048
Mommy, look at the clown.

375
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,527
What clown?

376
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:46,533
Come on, sweetie. Come on.

377
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:01,534
Dean, I cannot believe

378
00:26:01,535 --> 00:26:03,769
you told Papasian about
the homicidal phantom clown.

379
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,561
I told him an urban legend
about a homicidal phantom clown.

380
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:07,907
- I never said It was real.
- Keep It down.

381
00:26:10,022 --> 00:26:11,152
Oh, and get this.

382
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,311
I mentioned the Bunker
Brothers Circus in '81

383
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:16,094
and their evil-clown apocalypse.
Guess what.

384
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:16,847
What?

385
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:19,813
Before Mr. Cooper owned Cooper carnival,

386
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:21,145
he worked for the Bunker Brothers.

387
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,299
He was their lot manager.

388
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,150
So you think whatever's
the spirit attached to

389
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,525
- Cooper just brought it with him?
- Something like that.

390
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:31,137
I can't believe we keep
talking about clowns.

391
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,927
Want to come in and play?

392
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:19,189
Want to see mommy and daddy?
They're upstairs.

393
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,103
Hey!

394
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:33,000
Sam, watch out!

395
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:38,297
What's going on in here?

396
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:40,963
- Oh, my god! What do you do to my daughter!
- Get away from my kid!

397
00:27:40,964 --> 00:27:43,808
Mommy, daddy, they shot my clown.

398
00:27:53,394 --> 00:27:54,875
You really think they saw our plates?

399
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:58,206
I don't want to take the chance.

400
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,148
Besides, I hate this freaking thing anyway.

401
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:03,808
Well, one thing's for sure.

402
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,751
What's that?

403
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:07,172
We're not dealing with a spirit.

404
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:09,061
That rock salt hit something solid.

405
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,543
Yeah, a person, or maybe a creature
that can make itself invisible?

406
00:28:12,544 --> 00:28:14,472
Yeah, and dresses up like a clown for kicks?

407
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:15,861
Did it say anything in dad's journal?

408
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:16,729
Nope.

409
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:21,115
Who you calling?

410
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,548
Maybe Ellen or that guy Ash
will know something.

411
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:25,889
Hey, you think, uh...

412
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,634
You think dad and Ellen ever had a thing?

413
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:29,806
No way.

414
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:31,878
Then why didn't he tell us about her?

415
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,870
I don't know. Maybe
they had some sort of falling-out.

416
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,585
Yeah.

417
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:40,361
You ever notice dad had a falling-out
with just about everybody?

418
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:46,465
Don't get all maudlin on me, man.

419
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:47,256
What do you mean?

420
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:51,499
I mean this strong, silent thing of yours.
It's crap. I'm over it.

421
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,685
This isn't just anyone we're
talking about. This is dad.

422
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:55,334
I know how you felt about the man.

423
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:58,095
Back off, all right? Just because
I'm not caring and sharing like you want...

424
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:01,214
No, no, no. That's not what this is about, Dean.
I don't care how you deal with this,

425
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:02,927
but you have to deal with it, man.

426
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,585
Listen, I'm your brother, all right?
I just want to make sure you're okay.

427
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:08,399
Dude, I'm okay! I'm okay!

428
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,422
I swear, the next person
who asks me if I'm okay,

429
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:12,051
I'm gonna start throwing punches.

430
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:14,276
These are your issues.
Quit dumping them on me.

431
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:15,199
What are you talking about?

432
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,910
I just think it's really interesting
this sudden obedience you have to dad.

433
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:20,061
It's like, oh, what
would dad want me to do?

434
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,390
You spent your entire life
slugging it out with that man.

435
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:24,912
I mean, hell, you picked a fight with
him the last time you ever saw him,

436
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:26,868
and now that he's dead,
now you wanna make it right?

437
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:29,325
Well, I'm sorry, Sam, but you can't.
It's too little too late.

438
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:30,425
Why are you saying this to me?

439
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:34,484
I want you to be honest with yourself
about this! I'm dealing with dad's death.

440
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:35,342
Are you?

441
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:41,990
I'm gonna call Ellen.

442
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,332
Thanks a lot.

443
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,659
Rakshasa.

444
00:29:58,238 --> 00:30:00,820
- What's that?
- Ellen's best guess.

445
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:04,348
It's a race of ancient hindu creatures.
They appear in human form,

446
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:06,524
they feed on human flesh,

447
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:08,155
they can make themselves invisible,

448
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:10,823
and they cannot enter a home
without first being invited to.

449
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:12,969
They dress up like clowns,
and children invite them in.

450
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:13,570
Yeah

451
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:15,606
- Why don't they just munch on the kids?
- No idea.

452
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,015
Not enough meat on the bones, maybe?

453
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:20,574
- What else you find out?
- Apparently, Rakshasas live in squalor.

454
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:23,159
They sleep on a bed of dead insects.

455
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
- Nice.
- Yeah

456
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,705
And they have to feed a few times.
Every 20 to 30 years.

457
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:28,724
- Slow metabolism, I guess.
- That makes sense.

458
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:31,902
I mean, the carnival today,
the Bunker Brothers in '81.

459
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:34,262
Right.
Probably more before that.

460
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:36,313
Sam, who do we know that worked both shows?

461
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:37,912
- Cooper?
- Cooper.

462
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:41,232
You know, that picture of his father,

463
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:42,407
that looked just like him.

464
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:44,586
You think maybe it was him?

465
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,122
Well, who knows how old he is?

466
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:48,847
Ellen say how to kill him?

467
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,740
Legend goes a dagger made of pure brass.

468
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:54,931
I think I know where to get one of those.

469
00:30:54,932 --> 00:30:57,156
Well, before we go
stabbing things into Cooper,

470
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,610
we're gonna want to
make damn sure it's him.

471
00:30:58,611 --> 00:31:01,176
Oh, you're such a stickler
for details, Sammy.

472
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:03,799
All right, I'll round up the blade.

473
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,848
You go check if Cooper's got bedbugs.

474
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,263
Well, I got all kinds of knives.

475
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,703
I don't know if I got a brass one, though.

476
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:41,092
What do you think you're doing?

477
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:44,543
Check the trunk.

478
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:01,567
You?

479
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:06,710
Me.

480
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,268
All right!

481
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,744
Hey!

482
00:32:28,392 --> 00:32:29,144
Hey!

483
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,571
So, Cooper thinks I'm a
peeping tom, but it's not him.

484
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:33,781
Yeah, so I gathered.

485
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:35,440
It's the blind guy.
He's here somewhere.

486
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,530
- Well, did you get...
- The brass blades? No.

487
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:39,021
It's just been one of those days.

488
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,824
I got an idea. Come on.

489
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:50,957
Sam.

490
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:51,786
Dean.

491
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:54,654
Dean, find the maze, okay?

492
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:31,338
Hey!

493
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:32,532
Hey!

494
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:33,835
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

495
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:35,499
Shouldn't we see his clothes walking around?

496
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:40,139
Sam!

497
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:51,680
- Dean, where is it?
- I don't know!

498
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,570
Sam, behind you!

499
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:34,962
I hate fun houses.

500
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,229
You boys did a hell of a job.

501
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,021
- Your dad would be proud.
- Thanks.

502
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,519
Oh, yeah, I've got to, uh...

503
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:06,900
I've got to go...

504
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:08,358
over there...

505
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:09,561
right now.

506
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:16,026
- So.
- So.

507
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:18,790
Am I gonna see you again?

508
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:22,636
Do you want to?

509
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:25,808
I wouldn't hate it.

510
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:28,047
Can I be honest with you?

511
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:29,122
See, normally,

512
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:31,891
I'd be hitting on you so fast.
It'd make your head spin.

513
00:35:31,892 --> 00:35:32,876
But

514
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,428
these days...

515
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:37,335
I don't know.

516
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:38,910
Wrong place,

517
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:40,914
wrong time?

518
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:43,658
It's okay. I get it.

519
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,906
Where you guys been?

520
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:51,752
- I've been waiting for you.
- We were working a job, Ash.

521
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:55,206
- Clowns?
- Clowns? What the...

522
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:56,343
You got something for us, Ash?

523
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:58,774
Did you find the demon?

524
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:00,116
It's nowhere around,

525
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,775
at least nowhere I can find.

526
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:04,893
But if this fugly bastard raises its head,

527
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:08,509
I'll know. I mean,
I'm on it like divine on dog dookie.

528
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,407
What do you mean?

529
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,354
I mean

530
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:15,080
any of those signs or omens
appear anywhere in the world,

531
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:17,817
my rig will go off like a fire alarm.

532
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:19,715
You mind?

533
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:24,953
What's up, man?

534
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:28,629
Ash, where did you learn to do all this?

535
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,588
M.I.T., before I got bounced for fighting.

536
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:35,956
M.I.T.?

537
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:37,277
It's a school in Boston.

538
00:36:38,145 --> 00:36:38,918
Okay.

539
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,978
Give us a call as soon
as you know something?

540
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,157
Sí, sí, compadre.

541
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:55,154
Hey, listen.

542
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:58,789
If you boys need a place to stay,
I got a couple beds out back.

543
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,320
Thanks, but no.

544
00:37:02,477 --> 00:37:04,018
There's something I got to finish.

545
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:04,810
Okay.

546
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:20,637
You were right.

547
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:22,959
About what?

548
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:28,443
About me and dad.

549
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:32,589
I'm sorry that the last time I was
with him, I tried to pick a fight.

550
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,008
I'm sorry that I spent most
of my life angry at him.

551
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:36,763
I mean, for all I know, he died

552
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:38,043
thinking that I hate him.

553
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:41,256
So, you're right.

554
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:45,418
What I'm doing right now...
It is too little.

555
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:48,488
It's too late.

556
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:55,057
I miss him, man.

557
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,441
And I feel guilty as hell.

558
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,483
And I'm not all right...

559
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:07,478
not at all...

560
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:17,001
But neither are you.

561
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:19,734
That much I know.

562
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,313
I'll let you get back to work.
