1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,300
Dad wants us to pick
up where he left off --

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,500
Saving people, hunting
things, the family business.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,100
There's a really good
cure for a hangover.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,100
It's a greasy pork sandwich
served up in a dirty ashtray.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, i hate you. I know you do.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,600
We're not gonna start that crap again.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,100
Start what up? That prank stuff.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,100
It's stupid, and it always escalates.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,100
What's the matter, sammy?

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,300
Afraid you're gonna get
nair in your shampoo again?

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
Just remember, you started it.

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,000
What
the --

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
One, me. That's all you got?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,800
It's weak.

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
You're a friggin' jerk!

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You smell like a toilet. Chicken.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,200
Jerk. Bitch.

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Shut up. You wuss.

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,100
Tch. Jerk.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,900
Bring it on, baldy.

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,700
Excuse me.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,300
Are you lost?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,800
No.

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,500
I've been waiting for you, professor.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Huh.

26
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,500
Oh, you're in one of my classes?

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,100
Don't you recognize me?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Well...

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,700
They're big classes.

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,000
Anyway, my office hours are
tuesday and thursday mornings.

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,900
Really? I was...hoping
i could see you now.

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,100
Um...

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Well, since you asked
so nicely, come on.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Such a handsome photo.

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,500
That old thing.

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,000
So, what can i do for you?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
How's the anscombe paper coming?

38
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,400
Uh, professor, i

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Uh...

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,600
I have a confession to make.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,900
Oh? What's that?

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,500
I'm not really one of your students.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,700
Really. Then, why are you here?

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,400
Maybe i should just go.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Wait.

46
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,200
I get it.

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,700
I understand how you're
feeling, and it's only natural.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,900
You are young and wide-Eyed.

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,000
And i'm somewhat of a
celebrity around here.

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Don't get me wrong, you're
a very beautiful girl.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,900
But it would be wrong of
me to take advantage of you.

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,700
I just, uh...

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,600
I just respect you too much.

54
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,800
Oh, my god.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,900
What?

56
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,200
Don't you like me anymore?

57
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,200
Don't you want me?

58
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,900
<i>Dude, you mind not
eating those on my bed?</i>

59
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,600
No, i don't mind.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,400
How's the research going?

61
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
You know how it's going?

62
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,900
Slow.

63
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,800
You know how it would go
a heck of a lot faster?

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
If i had my computer.

65
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,100
Can you turn that down, please?

66
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,900
Yeah, absolutely.

67
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,200
You know what?

68
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,300
Maybe you should just go
somewhere for a while, huh?

69
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Hey, i'd love to.

70
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Unfortunately, my car's
all screwed to hell.

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,400
I told you, i have
nothing to do --

72
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,900
Hey, bobby. Hey, boys.

73
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,700
Hey, bobby.

74
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,100
It's good to see you again so soon.

75
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,900
Yeah, uh, thanks for coming.

76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,100
Come on in.

77
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,400
<i>Thank god you're here.</i>

78
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,400
So, um...

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
What didn't you want to talk
to me on the phone about?

80
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
Sam: it's this job we're working.

81
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
We weren't sure you'd believe us.

82
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,100
Well, i can believe a lot.

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Yeah, yeah, i know.

84
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,900
It's just we've never
seen anything like it.

85
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,000
Not even close.

86
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,900
We thought we could use some fresh eyes.

87
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,700
Why don't you begin at the beginning?

88
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Yeah. Um, all right, please.

89
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,400
So...

90
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,700
It all started when we
caught wind of an obit.

91
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,000
See, a professor took a nose
dive from a fourth-Story window,

92
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,000
Only there's a campus legend
that the building's haunted.

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,900
So we pretexted as reporters
from the local paper.

94
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,300
Yeah, we both had the professor
for "ethics and morality."

95
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,900
So, why do you think he did it?

96
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,600
Who knows? He was
tenured, wife and kids.

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,300
His book is a really big deal.

98
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,100
Then again, who's to say it was suicide?

99
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,200
Jen, come on.

100
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
<i>Well, what else could it be?</i>

101
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,100
Well, you know about crawford hall.

102
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,600
No, i don't, actually.

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a bunch of crap.
It's a total urban legend.

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
Well, heather's mom went to school here,

105
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
And she knew the girl.

106
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Wait, what girl?

107
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,200
Like, 30 years ago,

108
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,900
This girl was having an
affair with some professor.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,800
He broke it off.

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,700
She jumped out the
window and killed herself.

111
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,200
You know her name?

112
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,000
No.

113
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,900
But they say she jumped from room 669.

114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,000
Get it? You turn the 9 upside down...

115
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,900
So now she haunts the building,

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
And anyone who sees her...

117
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,100
They don't live to tell the tale.

118
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,700
Well, if no one lives to tell the tale,

119
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,500
Then how does the tale get told?

120
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,700
Curtis, shut up!

121
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,200
You know what? Uh, thanks
a lot, guys. Excuse me.

122
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,200
Dean.

123
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,200
What are you -- What
are you drinking?

124
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,400
I don't know, man.

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,700
I think they're called purple nurples.

126
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,700
I think we should check
out the professor's office.

127
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,900
Oh, no, no, no. I can't right now.

128
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,400
I've got a feisty little
wildcat on the hook.

129
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm about ready to
-- Zz! -- Reel her in.

130
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,400
I'll introduce
you. De--

131
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,700
Starla. Starla, hey.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,200
This is my shuttle copilot, major tom.

133
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,100
Major tom
-- Starla.

134
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Enchant?

135
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Hi.

136
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,100
Sorry. Just trying to
keep my liquor down.

137
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,700
Yeah. Good job.

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,300
Hey, good news.

139
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,700
She's got a sister.

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,300
Dean: whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

141
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,100
Hold on a minute. What?

142
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,900
Come on, dude. That's
not how it happened.

143
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,600
No?

144
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,900
So you never drank a purple nurple?

145
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,500
Yeah, maybe that, but...

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
I don't say things like,
"feisty little wildcat."

147
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,700
And her name wasn't starla.

148
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,000
Then what was it?

149
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know, but she
was a classy chick.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,600
She was a grad student,
anthropology and folklore.

151
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,800
We were talking about
local ghost stories.

152
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,400
Here's
to --

153
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,700
Here's to us.

154
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,800
My god, you are attractive.

155
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,300
Thanks. But no time for that now.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,200
You need to tell me
about this urban legend.

157
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,300
Please. Lives are at stake.

158
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,600
Sorry. I just -- I
can't even concentrate.

159
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,900
It's like staring...

160
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,700
Into the sky.

161
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,700
Dean, what do you think you're doing?

162
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,400
Sam, please.

163
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,000
If you wouldn't mind, just
give me five minutes here.

164
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Dean, this is a very
serious investigation.

165
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,900
We don't have time for any
of your blah blah blah blah.

166
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,600
Right.

167
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,400
<i>And that's how it really happened.</i>

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
I don't sound like that, dean.

169
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,300
That's what you sound like to me. Okay.

170
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,300
What's going on with you two?

171
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,800
Nothing. It's nothing.

172
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Come on.

173
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,900
You're bickering like
an old married couple.

174
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,300
No, see, married
couples can get divorced.

175
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,100
Me and hme? We're
like, uh, siamese twins.

176
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,500
It's "conjoined" twins. See what i mean?

177
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Look,
it --

178
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
We've just been on
the road for too long,

179
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,300
Tight quarters, all that.

180
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,700
Don't worry about it.

181
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Okay.

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,800
So, anyway, we figured
it might be a haunting,

183
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,200
So we went to check out
the scene of the crime.

184
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,800
So, how long have you been working here?

185
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,600
Janitor: i've been mopping
these floors for six years.

186
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,000
There you go, guys.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
What the heck's that for?

188
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,600
Just find the wire in the walls.

189
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,600
Ah. Well.

190
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,900
<i>Not sure why you're
wiring up this office.</i>

191
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,700
Not gonna do the professor much good.

192
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Why's that?

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,700
He's dead. Oh.

194
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
What happened?

195
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,400
He went out that window right there.

196
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,900
Yeah? Were you working that night?

197
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm the one who found him.

198
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,300
You see it happen? Nope.

199
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,500
I just saw him come up here and, uh...

200
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,100
Well... what?

201
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,300
<i>He wasn't alone.</i>

202
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,400
Who was he with?

203
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,700
Come on! I ate one, maybe two.

204
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,300
Just let me tell it, okay?

205
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,100
He was with a young lady.

206
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,700
I told the cops about her,

207
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,900
But i guess they never found her.

208
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,800
You saw this girl go in, huh?

209
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,300
But did you ever see her come out?

210
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,900
Now that you mention it, no.

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,900
You ever see her before, around?

212
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,800
Not her.

213
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
What do you mean?

214
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,500
I don't mean to cast aspersions
on a dead guy, but, uh...

215
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,800
Mr. Morality here?

216
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
<i>He brought a lot of girls up here.</i>

217
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,700
Got more ass than a toilet seat.

218
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
One more thing.

219
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,900
This building -- It only
has four stories, right?

220
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,600
Yeah.

221
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,200
So there wouldn't be a room 669?

222
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,100
Of course not. Why do you ask?

223
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,900
Ah, just curious.

224
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,400
Thanks. Sure.

225
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,100
Well, no traces of emf, that's for sure.

226
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,900
And that room 669's a load of crap.

227
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,000
So, what do you think? The
professor's just a jumper?

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,100
A legend's just a legend? I don't know.

229
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,300
The girl that the
janitor described --

230
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,000
That's pretty weird. Yeah.

231
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,200
We ought to check out the
history on the building.

232
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,300
See if any coed ganked herself there.

233
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,400
Yeah, you're right.

234
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,700
Dude, were you on my computer?

235
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,200
No. Oh, really?

236
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,500
'Cause it's frozen now

237
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,100
On -- On
bustyasianbeauties.Com.

238
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Dean...

239
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,600
Would you just -- Don't
touch my stuff anymore, okay?

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Why don't you control your ocd?

241
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,800
But did you dig up
anything about the building,

242
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,000
Or on the suicidal coed?

243
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
No. History's clean.

244
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
Then it's not a haunting.

245
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,100
Maybe not.

246
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,700
Tell you the truth,
we're not really sure.

247
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
What do you mean you're not sure?

248
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,700
Well...it's weird.

249
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,800
What's weird?

250
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,700
This next part, we, uh...

251
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,100
We didn't see it happen
ourselves, exactly, but...

252
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,100
It's pretty friggin' weird, even for us.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Aaaaaah!

254
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,900
Aliens? Yeah.

255
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,800
Aliens? Yeah.

256
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
<i>Look, even if they are real,</i>

257
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
They're sure as hell not coming
to earth and swiping people.

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,300
Hey, believe me. We know.

259
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,200
My whole life i've never found evidence

260
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,400
Of an honest-To-God
abduction.

261
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,300
It's all just cranks and pranks.

262
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,700
Yeah, that's what we thought.

263
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,800
But...we figured we'd
at least talk to the guy.

264
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,000
Hey, you ought to give
those purple nurples a shot.

265
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
So, what happened, curtis?

266
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
You won't believe me. Nobody does.

267
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,900
Give us a chance.

268
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,600
<i>I do not want this in the papers.</i>

269
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,200
Off the record, then.

270
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,400
I, uh...

271
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,100
I blacked out, and...

272
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,700
I lost time,

273
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,300
And when i woke up, i
don't know where i was.

274
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,500
Then what?

275
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,600
They did tests on me.

276
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
And, uh...

277
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
They, uh...

278
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,100
They probed me.

279
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,400
They probed you?

280
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Yeah, they probed me.

281
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,300
Again and a-- Again
and -- And again.

282
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,000
And again and again and again

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,500
And then one more time.

284
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,100
Yikes.

285
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,600
And that's not even the worst of it.

286
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,900
How could it get any worse?

287
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,500
Some alien made you his bitch.

288
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,300
They...

289
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,100
They made me...

290
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Slow dance!

291
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,900
You guys are exaggerating again, huh?

292
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
No no.

293
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,000
Then this frat boy's just nuts.

294
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
We're not so sure.

295
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,300
I'm telling you, dean,

296
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,500
This was made by some
kind of jet engine.

297
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,700
You mean some saucer-Shaped jet engine?

298
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,900
What else could it be?

299
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,300
What the hell? I don't know.

300
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,500
Seriously, dude -- What
the hell? I don't know.

301
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,600
I mean, first the hating. Now this?

302
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,100
The timing
alone --

303
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,600
There's got to be some
kind of connection.

304
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,700
You mean between the angry
spirit and the sexed-Up e.T.?

305
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,300
What could the connection possibly be?

306
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,300
But what could we do? So
we just kept on digging.

307
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,600
So, you and this
guy, curtis --

308
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,300
You were in the same house? Yeah.

309
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,000
You heard what happened to him, right?

310
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, he says it was aliens,
but, you know, whatever.

311
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
Look,
man, i --

312
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,900
I know this all has to be so hard.

313
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,000
Um, not so much.

314
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,400
But i want you to know...

315
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm here for you.

316
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,500
You brave little soldier.

317
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,900
I acknowledge your pain.

318
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,900
Come here.

319
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,600
You're too precious for this world.

320
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,200
I never said that!

321
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
You're always saying
pansy stuff like that.

322
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,800
Well, um...

323
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,700
Yeah, uh, thanks.

324
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,400
Thanks for the hug, but, uh, i'm okay.

325
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,500
Really.

326
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,800
To tell you the truth,

327
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,700
Whatever happened to
curtis, he had it coming.

328
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Why is that?

329
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,800
He's our pledge master.

330
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400
Put us through hell this semester

331
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,200
And got off on it.

332
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
So now he knows how we feel.

333
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,800
It's okay.

334
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,100
Still doesn't make a lick of sense.

335
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,600
But, hey, at least
there's one connection.

336
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,800
Between what?

337
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,600
The victims.

338
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
The professor and
the frat guy --

339
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,400
They're both dicks.

340
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,900
That's a connection?

341
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,200
You got anything better to
go on, i'd love to hear it.

342
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Where's my laptop?

343
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I don't know.

344
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,300
Think about it.

345
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,400
A philandering professor
gets a dead girl.

346
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,100
A pledge master gets hazed.

347
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,300
I left it in here.

348
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,500
You obviously didn't.

349
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,200
I mean, these punishments
-- They're almost poetic.

350
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Actually, it'd be more like
a limerick, but still --

351
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,500
Okay, hilarious. Ha ha.

352
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,700
Where'd you hide it?

353
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,200
What, your computer?
Yeah, where'd you hide it?

354
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,500
Why would i take your computer?

355
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
Because no one else could have.

356
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,500
We keep the door locked.
We never let any maids in.

357
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,900
Looks like you lost it, poindexter.

358
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,000
Dude, you know something? I
put up with a lot from you.

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
What are you talking about?
I'm a joy to be around.

360
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,100
Yeah? Your dirty socks in the sink,

361
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,700
Your food in the fridge.

362
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,500
What's wrong with my food?

363
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,600
It's not food anymore,
dean! It's darwinism.

364
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,800
All i ask from you, the one thing,

365
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,500
Is that you don't mess with my stuff!

366
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
You done?

367
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,300
You know, how would you feel
if i screwed with the impala?

368
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,700
It'd be the last thing you ever did.

369
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,600
Did you take his computer?

370
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Serves him right, but, no.

371
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,700
Well, i didn't lose it.

372
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,000
<i>'Cause i don't lose things.</i>

373
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,100
Oh, that's right,
'cause he's mr. Perfect.

374
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Okay, okay.

375
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,200
Why don't you just tell
me what happened next?

376
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,600
There was one more victim.

377
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,100
Now, we didn't see this
one ourselves, either.

378
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,800
We kind of put it
together from the evidence.

379
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,900
But this guy -- He was
a research scientist.

380
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Animal testing.

381
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,500
Yeah, you know -- A dick,
which fits the pattern.

382
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,800
Hey.

383
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,600
Well, this ought to be quick.

384
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Ok

385
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,700
That is just nasty.

386
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,300
Uh, yeah.

387
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,600
Mutilated?

388
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,300
Looks to me like something was hungry.

389
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,200
They identify him yet?

390
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah. A research
scientist at the college.

391
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,200
Guess where his office was, by the way.

392
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,600
Crawford hall, same as the professor.

393
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,500
That's right where the frat
boy had his close encounter.

394
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Yeah.

395
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Hey, grab me that thing, would you?

396
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,700
Thanks.

397
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,100
What is it?

398
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,900
Looks like a...

399
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,800
A belly scale?

400
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,100
A belly scale? From what?

401
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,300
Uh...

402
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,600
An alligator?

403
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,700
An alligator in the sewer.

404
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,900
Come on.

405
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,500
What? Well, dean, it's
a classic urban legend.

406
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
A kid flushes a baby
gator down the toilet,

407
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
And it grows huge in the tunnels.

408
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,100
But no one's ever really found one.

409
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,400
They're not real.

410
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,700
Neither's alien abduction,

411
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,400
But something chomped on this guy.

412
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,100
This couldn't get any weirder.

413
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,200
Maybe we should get some
help. I'll call bobby.

414
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,100
Maybe he's run into
something like this before.

415
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, i'm sure he has.

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Just your typical haunted campus,

417
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,700
Alien abduction,
alligator-In-The-Sewer gig.

418
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,900
Yeah, it's simple.

419
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,500
We decided to search the sewer anyway,

420
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,800
So we split up, each
taking one end of campus.

421
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,100
Did you find anything?

422
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,200
Yeah, i found something,
just not in the sewer.

423
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
Dean: son of a bitch!

424
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,300
Sam!

425
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,200
You think this is funny?

426
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,200
It depends. What?

427
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
The car! What about the car?

428
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,900
You can't let the air out of the tires.

429
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,200
You're gonna bend the rims!

430
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,600
Whoa, wait a minute.

431
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,200
I didn't go near your car.

432
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,900
Oh, yeah? Huh.

433
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
Then how'd i find this?

434
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,500
Hey, give me back my money.

435
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,800
Oh, no, no.

436
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,900
Consider it reparations
for, uh, emotional trauma.

437
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,300
Yeah, very funny. Now, give it back.

438
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,500
No.

439
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,400
Dean,i have had it up to here with you.

440
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Yeah? Right back at you!

441
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,200
Get off me! Give it back!

442
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
Okay, i've heard enough.

443
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,700
You showed up about an hour after that.

444
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,600
I'm surprised at you two.

445
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,800
I really am.

446
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,500
Sam, first off, dean did
not steal your computer.

447
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
But i -- Shh,
shh, shh, shh!

448
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,500
And, dean, sam did not touch your car.

449
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah.

450
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,200
And if you two bothered to pull
your heads out of your asses,

451
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
It all would have been pretty clear.

452
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,600
What? What you're dealing with.

453
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,500
Uh...

454
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,600
I got nothing. Me neither.

455
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,000
You got a trickster on your hands.

456
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,300
That's what i thought.

457
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,800
What?! No, you didn't.

458
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
I got to tell you...

459
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,200
You guys were the biggest clue.

460
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,300
What do you mean?

461
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,600
These things create chaos and mischief

462
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,700
As easy as breathing,

463
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
And it's got you so turned around

464
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,400
And at each other's throats,

465
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,800
You can't even think straight.

466
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
The laptop. The tires.

467
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,500
It knows you're onto him,

468
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,600
And it's been playing you like fiddles.

469
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,400
So, what is it --
Spirit, demon, what?

470
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,500
Well, more like demigods, really.

471
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,400
There's loki in scandinavia.

472
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,800
There's anansi in west africa.

473
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,000
Dozens of them.

474
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,100
They're immortal,

475
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,300
And they can create
things out of thin air,

476
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,600
Things as real as you and me.

477
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,000
Make them vanish just as quick.

478
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,600
You mean like an angry spirit
or an alien or an alligator.

479
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,500
The victims fit the m.O., too.

480
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,300
Tricksters target the
high and the mighty,

481
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,100
Knock them down a peg, usually
with a sense of humor --

482
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,200
Deadly pranks, things like that.

483
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,500
Bobby, what do these things look like?

484
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,700
Lots of things, but human, mostly.

485
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
And what human do we know

486
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,200
Who's been at ground
zero this whole time?

487
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Janitor: oh, that's a good one.

488
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,600
Come here

489
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Could you eat?

490
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,400
I could eat. Come on.

491
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,400
Something's missing.

492
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,800
That's better.

493
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,000
Mmm!

494
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Sorry i'm dragging a
little ass today, boys.

495
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,500
Had quite the night last night.

496
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,100
Lots of sex, if you catch my drift.

497
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,200
Yeah, hard not to.
Listen, we won't be long.

498
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,500
We just need to check a
couple offices up on 3.

499
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,600
No problem.

500
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,000
I, uh, forgot something in the truck.

501
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,900
You know what? I'll
catch up with you guys.

502
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,600
Okay.

503
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,300
<i>Just 'cause he reads
the weekly world news</i>

504
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,600
Doesn't mean he's our guy.

505
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,500
You read it, too.

506
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
I'm telling you, it's him.

507
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,100
Look, i just think we
need some hard proof.

508
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,000
That's all.

509
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,300
Another thing bobby mentioned
was that these suckers

510
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,700
Have a metabolism like an
insect, a real sweet tooth.

511
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,300
I didn't find any candy bars or sugar.

512
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,900
Not even equal. Probably
missed something.

513
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,700
I don't miss things.

514
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,900
Oh, right, 'cause you're mr. Perfect.

515
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,700
What?

516
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,200
Are you really still pissed at me

517
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,500
'Cause of what the trickster did?

518
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,100
You been a tight ass long
before that trickster showed up.

519
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,000
Look, just...stay here,
keep an eye on the janitor.

520
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,500
I'll go to his place to see if
i can find any actual evidence

521
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,800
Before you go barging
in and staking the man!

522
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,600
Just wt till i get back, okay?

523
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,000
Okay? Okay!

524
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,900
Eh, screw this.

525
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
We've been waiting for you, dean.

526
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Y-Y-You guys
aren't real.

527
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,400
Trust me, sugar, it's gonna feel real.

528
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Come on. Let us give you a massage.

529
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,200
You know, i'm a -- I'm a
sucker for a happy ending.

530
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Really, i am, but...

531
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,800
I-I'm gonna have to pass.

532
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,500
Janitor: they're a peace offering.

533
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,900
<i>I know what you and your brother do.</i>

534
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,100
I've been around a while.
Run into your kind before.

535
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,400
Well, then you know that i...

536
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,300
Can't let you just keep hurting people.

537
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,700
Come on!

538
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,800
Those people got what
was coming to them.

539
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Hoisted on their own petards.

540
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,100
But you and sam
-- I like you.

541
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,600
I do.

542
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,300
So treat yourself...

543
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,000
Long as you want.

544
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,900
Just long enough for me to
move on to the next town.

545
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,700
Yeah, i don't think
i can let you do that.

546
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,200
I don't want to hurt you.

547
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,200
And you know that i can.

548
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Look, man, i --
I got to tell you,

549
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,800
I dig your style, all right?

550
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,700
I mean [chuckles] i do. I mean

551
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,600
And the
slow-Dancing alien --

552
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,700
One of my personal favorites. Yeah.

553
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,900
But, uh, i can't let you go.

554
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Too bad.

555
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,200
Like i said, i like you.

556
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Sam was right.

557
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
You shouldn't have come alone.

558
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,800
Well, i'll agree with you there.

559
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,000
That fight you
guys had outside --

560
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,600
That was a trick?

561
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,500
Hmm.

562
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,600
Not bad.

563
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,200
But you want to see a real trick?

564
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Ohh!

565
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,900
Aah!

566
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,600
Ohh!

567
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,200
Ohh!

568
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,200
Ha!

569
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,500
Nice toss, ladies!

570
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Dean...

571
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
Dean, dean, dean.

572
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,500
<i>I did not want to have to do this.</i>

573
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,300
Me neither.

574
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,500
You guys okay?

575
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,900
Yeah.

576
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
I guess.

577
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
All i got to say...

578
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,100
He had style.

579
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
Ohh.

580
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,100
Bobby, thanks a lot.

581
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,200
Hey, save it!

582
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
Let's just get the hell out of dodge

583
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,100
Before somebody finds that body.

584
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah

585
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,300
Look, dean, um...

586
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,100
I just want to say that i'm, uh...

587
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Um...

588
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,400
Hey.

589
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,900
Me too.

590
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,700
You guys are breaking my heart.

591
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,400
Could we please just leave?
