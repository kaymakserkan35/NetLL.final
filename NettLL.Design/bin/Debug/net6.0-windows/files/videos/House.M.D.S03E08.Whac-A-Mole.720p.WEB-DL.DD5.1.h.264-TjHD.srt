You're a person of interest

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,670
You want your car back?

You're gonna have to

81
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,410
Thanks. Usually people
feel helpless
in these situations.

82

probably going to jail.

83
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,220

you'll go right along
with him.

84
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,560
House was on this page
when he got that annoying
"I'm such a genius" look.

85
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,220
What's there?

88
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,500

his parents died.
Quit smoking.

89
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,240
House didn't
mock my viral idea.
He just said it was wrong.

90
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,880
Which means
he didn't want to
give reasons.

91
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,310
Which means
I must have been close.

92
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm thinking bacterial.

93
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,910
I'm doing a blood culture.

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,080
I am doing an MRI.

95
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,120
If it was a tumor,

96
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,850
intracranial pressure could
cause his brain to
herniate before lunch.

97
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,260
Same thing with
the stress test.

98
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,960
Which is why I'm ditching it.
What are you doing instead?

99
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,160
Not telling.

100
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,130
Seriously?
You're playing his game?

101
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,070
We're all playing his game.
Might as well enjoy it.

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,530
Anybody else sick at work?

103
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,540
I had a stomachache
before him.

104
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,940
This isn't your fault, Will.
Keep working.

105
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,500
My brother's in the hospital.

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,270
Mrs. Collier won't care
if I finish my homework.

107

Your brother cares
if you finish your homework.

imaginary friend?

109

He's a doctor.

110
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,360
How are the feet?
Still itch?

111
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,500
Is that important?
I don't know. Is it?

112
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,040
What kinds of drugs
you into?

113
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,670
You don't have to
talk about that right now.

114
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,770
No, it's okay.

115
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,010
I don't keep secrets
from them.

116
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,310
They know I did drugs
before our parents died.

117
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,120
Clever. Admit the past.
Deny the present.

118
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,420
I'm clean.

119
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,190
I'm raising two kids.
It'd be pretty irresponsible,
wouldn't it?

120
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,660
But confiding in
an eight-year-old is okay.

121
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,890
If I'm open with them,
then they'll be open with me.

122
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,870
Yeah.
Turning the other cheek's
a good strategy in boxing.

123
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,730
Kids don't lie because
they got trust issues.

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,860
They lie because
they've got something to hide.

125
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,960
Look at him.

126
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,410
He's sitting there
doing nothing
and he's still lying.

127
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,440
We don't lie to Jack.

128
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,670
Spelling test you failed
and forgot to...
No.

129
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,770
Math test?
No.

130
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,550
Fight with the kid
sitting next to you?
He doesn't sit next to me.

131
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,450
And the other one's
probably having sex.

132
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,320
I am not.
Yet.

133
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,050
But when you start,
you're gonna lie about it.

134
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,630
Colder.
I'm not playing.

135
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,970
Keep very still for me, Jack.
This won't take long.

137
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,910
Does he have to be here?
No. Ignore him.

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,950
It's not his lungs.
I never said it was.

139
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,510
What about the cigarettes?
How'd you quit?

140
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,850
Gum? The patch? Hypnosis?

141
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,750
He went from two packs
to nothing, cold turkey.

142
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,830
Or we could just
make small talk.

143

You still seeing
that nurse in Pedes?

144
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,390
I just don't think
she's right for you.

145
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,500
You need someone detached,
calculating, ambitious.

146
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,510
You need yourself in a skirt.

147
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,630
Jack, he asked you a question.

148
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,970
I didn't really quit.
I just sort of
lost taste for it.

149
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,440
Interesting. Sounds like
one of those symptom thingies.

150
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,510
He's still puking,
and he had a heart attack
and itchy feet.

151
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,590
It's not his lungs.
I never said it was.

152
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,550
Ice cold.

153
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,060
I'm injecting ergonovine
to see if your heart attack

154
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,830
was caused by
a spasm in the vessels
surrounding your heart.

155
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,140
Let me know if
anything feels... unusual.

156
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,710
If the problems are at
my heart, why did that other
doctor look at my brain?

157
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,620
Yeah. Why did
that other doctor
look at his brain?

158
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,420
We're just trying to eliminate
as many possibilities
as we can.

159
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,480
So because you think
that a spasm caused
his heart attack,

160
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,860
you're gonna induce
another spasm?

161
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,620
Did you consent to this?

162
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,290
CAMERON:
Everything's under control.

163
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,890
Tests are gonna identify
which arteries are affected
so we can repair them.

164
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,100
Your meds don't seem
to be doing anything.

165
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,870
So either you're wrong,

166
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,670
or his system hasn't
been pushed enough
to set anything off.

167
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,220
You wanna get back home,
right?

168
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,280
I mean, you're probably
already falling behind with
the housework and the bills.

169
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,050
How many sick days
you think you'll get
before they replace you?

170
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,150
Heart rate's up. Nothing else.

171
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,060
They can't fire me
if I'm sick.

172
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,190
Right. You're irreplaceable.

173
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,930
Who else would they find
qualified to dance
with a rodent?

174
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,800
How can you even
support your family?

175
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,470
What happens when those kids
grow out of their clothes?
When they get sick?

176
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,170
Still no spasm.

177
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,180
They'll take those kids
away from you, Jack.

178
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,510
Maybe I should bring them
in here right now so that
you can kiss them goodbye.

179
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,580
Can't you see
his heart is fine!
Stop torturing him!

180
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,780
What kind of doctor are you?

181
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,420
CUDDY: Wonderful.
Thank you so much. Okay, bye.

182
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,730
You're just getting here?
Busses suck.

183
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,230
Where's your car?
It's a hostage.

184
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,530
Tritter wants me to
testify against House.

185
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,870
You're not going to.

186
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,770
Is that a question
or an order?

187
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,640
Any sort of conviction
will cost House
his license...

188
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,180
Which will cost
this hospital. Relax.

189
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,150
I'm not gonna mess
with your precious resource.

190
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,650
I told my lawyer to
tell Tritter to go to hell.
Marco!

191
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,450
Why are all my prescriptions
getting bounced back?

192
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,220
Sorry, Dr. Wilson.
I was trying to call you.
Where's your phone?

193
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,280
In my car.

194
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,420
My patients,
on the other hand,

195
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,020
are here and
needed their medications.

196
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,290
I'm sorry. I can't.
Your DEA number's
been suspended.

197
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,570
<i>HOUSE.: Why so sad?</i>

198
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,470
There's still a chance
that Chase got it right.

199
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,700
(GROANS)

200
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,400
That was suspenseful
for about two seconds.

201
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,410
Blood culture was
negative for bacteria.

202
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,050
But positive for hepatitis A?

203
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,450
I wonder who could've ordered
that extra test.

204
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,780
Must be somebody who knew
what persistent vomiting,

205
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,950
sudden distaste for nicotine
and itchy feet have in common.

206
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,750
Hep A doesn't explain
the heart attack.

207
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,660
No. But as Chase so deftly
pointed out earlier,
puking does.

208
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,560
And hep A
explains the puking.

209
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,900
If this had been real life
instead of just a game...

210
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,840
The DEA just revoked
my prescription privileges.

211
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,510
Well, who's gonna
prescribe my Vicodin?

212
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,910
Yes, well,
that's why I'm here.

213
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,450
This is a disaster for you.

214
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,810
Relax.

215
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,270
Tritter's just getting
desperate. He's got
no real evidence.

216
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,840
He's trying to
squeeze you into ratting.

217
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,250
I'm not gonna
let him squeeze my patients.

218
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,650
They'll be fine.
Most of your cancer medicine
sucks anyway.

219
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,620
I'm gonna use your team
to do my prescribing until
this is straightened out.

220
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,100
Suddenly this doesn't seem
nearly as dramatic.

221
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,930
Go pump IVIG into the kid,
cure him and
get him out of here.

222
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,370
Hep A?
No.

223
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,110
"Chase, blood test
for bacteria.

224
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,270
"Foreman, MRI,
too stubborn to
check the lungs.

225
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,510
"Cameron, nice try. No spasm."

226
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,810
"But the princess sat
and sat and sat,

227
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,850
"pretending not to listen."

228
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,820
Pretending to write
in her journal
with the flowers on it.

229
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,830
Pretending she didn't like
stories about eight-year-olds
who save the world.

230
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,960
I'm 11.

231
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,560
Which is why
you can no longer
save the world.

232
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,440
I'm eight!
Yeah.

233
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,000
We're all completely
dependent on you.

234
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,370
Morning.
Morning.

235
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,710
Good news.
We can take you off the IVIG.

236
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,980
The hep A has cleared
your system. You'll be good
to go by tomorrow.

237
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,150
How do you think I got it?

238
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,750
Well, it could've been
contaminated food.

239
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,160
It could've been from cleaning
the bathrooms at work.
Or it could've been...

240
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,760
Don't worry.
They've heard it all.

241
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,560
Anilingus is a common way.

242
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,760
You should just
tell the people
that you've dated

243
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,000
they should get
themselves checked.

244
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,430
Don't worry.

245
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,000
I've been too busy
chasing after these guys
to go spelunking.

246
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
You're gross.

247
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,180
I think.
Does your arm hurt?

248
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,340
Arm's fine, bro.

249
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,150
Then why's it bleeding?
It's not. It's...

250
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,350
Raise your arm
above your head.

251
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,250
Your ear... And your nose...

252
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,440
FOREMAN: High PT and PTT
on Jack's blood panel
confirm a coagulopathy.

253
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,140
So, we cure the hep A,
something else pops up.

254
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,810
Interesting.

255
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,080
What infections cause DIC?

256
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,770
You okay?

257
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,310
Hurt my shoulder
playing fantasy football.

258
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,020
Shall we discuss
what causes DIC,

259
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,720
or should we just
send the kid back
to his miserable life?

260
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,820
He's not miserable.
Right.

261
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,230
He's thrilled that
his parents are dead
and his life is over.

262
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,530
The restaurant's probably
teeming with E. Coli,
Eikenella and strep.

263
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,070
Kids don't wash their hands
between the potty
and the party and...

264
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,610
Or it's a food-borne toxin.
Jack eats at that cesspool
every day.

265
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,570
And Jack's the only one
who got sick?

266
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,700
Kid's got tattoos, piercings

267
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,040
and probably
some nasty little girl
who loaned him the hep A.

268
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,210
Could've also given him
syphilis or gonorrhea.

269
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,050
I need one of you.
Take Cameron.

270
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,140
Your idea was dumb anyway.

271
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,650
Chase, I need you to head back
to that cesspool and
get me the kid's puke.

272
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,460
Foreman, do an LP
and have Cameron run down
that potty-party theory.

273
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,590
Why don't I just test him?

274
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,470
Let's not discuss this
in front of the help.

275
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,170
The amount of vomiting
that kid did,

276
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,270
there wouldn't be enough
toxins left in his system
to show up in his blood.

277
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,840
And since he vomited
in the toilet here
instead of on somebody,

278
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,850
that restaurant
is our only source
of essential vomit.

279
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,540
And you couldn't say that
in front of Foreman?

280
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,420
No, I couldn't say this
in front of Foreman.
I need a refill.

281
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,390
Detective Tritter knows about
the scripts I wrote before.

282
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,550
Exactly. If you stop now,
it'll look suspicious.

283
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,850
Does anyone fall
for that argument?

284
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,900
Write the script.

285
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,560
No.

286
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,190
One prescription
isn't gonna make...

287
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,900
We both know
it's not gonna be just one.

288
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,800
I'd rather lose my job
than lose my license.

289
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,920
Daniel Silvers, prostate
cancer. Needs filgrastim,
two-week supply.

290
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,650
Andrea Donovan,
breast cancer.

291
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,160
Just needs her refill
on her megestrol.

292
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,190
You're not writing.
You want me to write?

293
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,100
Well, you could phone them in.
But eventually, yeah,

294
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,140
probably somebody's gonna want
something written down.

295
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,700
I haven't met these people.
I have.

296
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,940
I've diagnosed them
and everything.
I know.

297
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,940
I know. I'm not saying
I don't trust you.

298
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,450
Just my diagnoses.

299
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,140
These are gonna be
my prescriptions. I...
They're my patients.

300
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,210
My prescriptions.
My name!

301
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,420
That Tritter will read
on the script.

302
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,720
He wants to make you
miserable. You don't think
he's gonna ask questions?

303
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,990
(SIGHS)

304
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,690
Is there anything Jack does
that no one else does?
Any special duties?

305
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,000
No, we got lots of bussers.

306
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,330
What kind of cleaning products
do you use?

307
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,340
We got a bunch of kids
running around, sticking
everything in their mouths,

308
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,570
so we can't use
anything toxic.

309
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,670
This is it. Monday's trash.

310
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,150
So there's no one
who can maybe help
get the bags out?

311
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,710
Sorry. Short-handed.

312
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,520
I can tip.

313
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,090
I'm pretty sure Jack's puke
is in a blue trash bag
with the wrapped gifts,

314
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,330
but if you find spaghetti
that's the wrong vomit.

315
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,730
How much longer
do I have to stay on
this medication?

316
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,940
I mean, I'm nauseous
all the time.

317
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,910
Maybe I should go back
on the tamoxifen.

318
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,010
You're doing so much better
on the anastrozole, Beth.

319
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,750
I'm reluctant to
make a change.

320
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,720
I can't play with my daughter
or pick her up from school.

321
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,520
I can barely get up
and tuck her in at night.

322
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,190
There's got to be
something else.

323
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,560
Who is she?

324
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,330
Well, as you know,
this is a teaching hospital.

325
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,830
She's a student?
No, I'm a doctor.

326
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,560
I'm assisting
Dr. Wilson today.

327
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,660
Why? Do you think he got
my diagnosis wrong?

328
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,140
No. I'm sure...
No. No.

329
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,200
She's just consulting
regarding my prescriptions.

330
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,940
You think he got
my meds wrong?
No. It's just...

331
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,310
No.
Then why is she here?

332
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,120
What are you doing now?

333
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,550
I'm gonna get a sample
of your brother's
spinal fluid.

334
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,660
Where's Will?
School.

335
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,330
Is that gonna hurt?

336
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,390
It's gonna help us figure out
what's making him sick.

337
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,100
Shouldn't you be
in class, too?
Teacher work day.

338
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,640
For you but not Will?

339
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,010
Yeah, didn't make
sense to me, either.

340
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,540
Can I help?

341
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,350
Well, I guess it's quicker
than calling a nurse
and a truant officer.

342
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,390
Okay, grab his shins
and push his knees up
towards his chest.

343
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,290
Now hold him there tight.

344
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,190
This all nurses do?

345
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,060
My boss doesn't trust them
to do anything else.

346

(JACK GROANING)

347
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,330
Is he gonna die?

348
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,410
No. No one's gonna die.

349
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,950
In the whole world ever?
That's so great.

350
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,850
I meant...
I know what you meant.

351
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,720
But I also know
bad things do happen.

352
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,430
My dad always had a few drinks
when they went out.

353
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,260
Always said
he'd be okay to drive.

354
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,560
Until he wasn't.

355
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,760
I would just like
some warning this time.

356
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,680
We're nowhere near
anything like that
happening right now. Okay?

357
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,440
Let's get him back over.

358
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,150
(JACK SCREAMS)

359
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,020
What was that?

360
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,260
What did you do?

361
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,560
You broke his rib?
I barely touched him.

362
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,890
Which means...

363
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,960
(GROANS)

364
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,960
Found it.
Fix it.

365
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,770
Osteomyelitis.
Means the infection's
spread to his bones,

366
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,900
which means
it's either bacterial
or viral and not...

367
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,340
(GROANS)

368
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,440
I hired you to
take away the pain.
Was there some confusion?

369
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,110
Ever thought about
using your cane
on the proper side?

370
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,550
Yeah, that's the issue.

371
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,080
Friday night my cane
suddenly noticed
it was on the wrong side.

372
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,560
Can you score me some Vicodin?
No.

373
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,650
I did a needle aspiration
to confirm which...
How long till the culture's...

374
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,130
(SCREAMS)

375
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,960
Why do you only do that
when I'm talking?

376
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,930
You gotta rest your shoulder.

377
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,270
And we're gonna get you
on some different equipment.

378
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,480
Nice cane.
If I know what you mean.

379
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,220
Chase, you can stop
doing that.
I'm almost finished.

380
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,190
He's got osteomyelitis.

381
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,750
Means you're wrong
about food-borne toxins.

382
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,360
And you can stop, too.
It's syphilis.

383
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,930
You sure?
Read the print out.

384
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,210
He's also positive
for Eikenella.

385
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,940
One of you two screwed up.
No.

386
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,510
Not a chance.

387
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,790
Or this kid is a lot sicker
than we thought.
Finish that test.

388
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,190
Should be impossible
to get two right answers
to one question.

389
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,320
It's okay to have three?
Apparently.

390
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,370
CHASE: He's positive
for botulism, too.

391
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,810
So, we knock down
one infection and
three more pop up.

392
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,340
I think this game is rigged.

393
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,580
Jack?

394
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,680
Somebody help!

395
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,250
FOREMAN: We've managed to
clear all three infections
out of his system,

396
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,190
but now he's having seizures
every few hours.

397
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,730
He's gotta be
immunocompromised.
No.

398
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,130
White count was normal,
and he was negative for HIV.

399
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,400
Well, if he's not
immunocompromised,

400
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,230
why is he acting like
he's immunocompromised?

401
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,100
HOUSE: What do
the seizures tell us?
Nothing.

402
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,230
There were no structural
abnormalities on the CT,

403
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,330
nonfocal neuro exam,
no electrolyte imbalance.
Nothing.

404
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,680
What do unexplained seizures
and really sick 18-year-olds
have in common?

405
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,120
You thinking trauma?
I'm thinking drugs.

406
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,220
He's an admitted user.
The drugs trashed
his immune system.

407
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,020
Tox screen was clean.

408
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,390
Clean tox screen means
there's no drugs
in his blood or urine.

409
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,560
There could still be drugs
trapped in his fat cells
from the good old days.

410
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,190
If they're in his fat,
why would they be
affecting him now?

411
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,100
The keen observer would notice
that he's had some
digestive issues lately.

412
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,470
His weight loss
could've burned off fat cells

413
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,170
and released the drugs
back into his system.

414
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,410
FOREMAN: There's no way
to know. It's impossible to
test fat cells for drugs.

415
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,940
But it's not impossible
to make him lose more weight.

416
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,380
You want us to starve him
so we can drive him
into another seizure?

417
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,220
Maybe a heart attack?
Just so we can run
another tox screen?

418
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,260
That'd be cruel.
Just sweat it out of him.

419
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,190
I haven't touched a thing
since the night
my parents died.

420
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,670
Drugs stay in your system
a long time.

421
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,680
I was high the night
the cops came to
tell us what happened.

422
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,210
You know the first thing I did
when they told me?

423
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,520
I laughed.

424
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,530
I'm not the person
I was when they died.

425
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,390
I wish they could see that.

426
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,700
Well, I'm sure
they're watching,
and I'm sure they're proud.

427
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,560
That's what Will's
guidance counselor
keeps telling him.

428
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,630
What do you tell him?

429
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,570
I tell him it's crap.

430
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,010
Our parents live on
in our memories,
but they don't live on.

431
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,790
CHASE: Jack?
CAMERON: Hold him still.

432
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,790
Don't break his arm.
CAMERON: We'll fix it.

433
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,630
We need to get a sample.

434
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,890
House.

435
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,660
Bad news.

436
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,140
Look at you.

437
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,740
You couldn't have sent
Cameron down here to
this air-conditioned hallway

438
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,800
to deliver the bad news?

439
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,310
Jack seized again,
but his blood was clean.
Completely drug free.

440
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,610
So he just happened to have
a seizure at the exact time
that we stuck him in a sauna?

441
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,810
It's not a coincidence.

442
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,720
He's still seizing every
few hours whether we stick
him in a sauna or not.

443
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,050
Oh, my God!
Why are you using that?

444
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,190
I've had it for years.

445
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,430
No, that's...
That's gonna make
your shoulder hurt.

446
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,090
You need one of these.

447
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,570
He's a doctor.

448
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,800
Is he still infection-free?
I'm sure not for long.

449
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,500
My point being that something
other than those infections
caused these seizures.

450
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,140
Means there's something
in his head. Scan him.

451
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,080
We scanned him.
Well, that was then.
This is not then.

452
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,380
Kid keeps changing.
Scan him again.

453
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,940
Where is Cameron?

454
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,150
I am not writing you
a script for Vicodin.

455
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,450
I've only got two pills left.

456
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,090
Cut them in half.
Then you'll have four.

457
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,820
You're prescribing for Wilson.
Wilson prescribes for me.

458
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,260
Write up a script.

459
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,300
You know
you have a problem.
Yeah.

460
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,660
It's got a badge
and everything.

461
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,460
You're taking too much...
Fine! You're right.

462
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,270
What's the correct amount?
Write up a script
for the correct amount.

463
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,370
No answer? That's 'cause
we're having the wrong debate.

464
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,510
This has got nothing
to do with my problem

465
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,210
and everything to do with you
avoiding a problem.

466
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,010
You're afraid that
if you write me a prescription

467
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,210
you're gonna wind up
like Wilson.

468
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,810
Of course I am.

469
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,060
Tritter wants to win
by giving pain.

470
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,320
Do you really want
to be a part of that?

471
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,520
As a doctor,
how do you do that?

472
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,830
Here.

473
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,170
This'll tide you over.
Takes the edge off my PMS.

474
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,070
Should do wonders for you.

475
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,950
Why are you
looking at my head again?

476
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,050
Seizures usually indicate
something neurological.

477
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,150
I'm not gonna get better.

478
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,020
Am I?

479
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,520
We'll know more
after the test.

480
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,690
I've gotta find out
who can take care of
Will and Kama.

481
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,130
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

482
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,890
You'll be home yelling at them
and kicking their butts
before you know it.

483
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,340
(FOREMAN SIGHS)

484
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,410
This kid might be facing
a terminal disease,

485
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
and he's more worried
about his brother and sister.

486
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,280
CHASE: Brain stem's clean.

487

Nothing in the midbrain.
What's that?

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,190
The frontal lobe,
upper-right quadrant.

489
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,760
I don't see anything.
There.

490
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,600
It's tiny,
but I think it's a tumor.

491
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,360
That size should be excisable.
Why didn't we see it earlier?
How could...

492
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,770
Oh, God!

493
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,910
Axial view.
There's another one.

494
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,670
Bring up the next slice.

495
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,740
They're everywhere.

496
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,750
Jack's brain is
riddled with tumors.

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,560
And you know what he's doing?
Moaning?

498
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,260
Setting up play dates.
Wow, what a guy. Theories?

499
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,630
The obvious one,
brain cancer destroyed
his immune system,

500
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,530
left him wide open
for these infections.

501
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,790
House, you're pathetic.

502
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,570
You'll analyze
anyone's faults,
hypocrisies, weaknesses,

503
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,830
but this kid's
got some strength,

504
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,900
and all of a sudden
there's no time to talk about
anything but the medicine.

505
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,070
He's teaching pre-pubescent
kids that truth matters,
God doesn't and life sucks.

506
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,840
I like him. Treatment?

507
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,820
We need to
start him on radiation.

508
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,980
That'll destroy
whatever's left of
his immune system.

509
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,080
FOREMAN: And save his life!

510
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,620
I know the notion
of self-sacrifice
is foreign to you...

511
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,390
You wanna think that he's
sacrificing himself because
if one person can do it,

512
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,330
then maybe the world
isn't the cold, selfish place
you know that it is.

513
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,990
Radiation could kill him.
Alternatives?

514
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,500
There aren't any.
We saw the tumors...

515
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,040
We could choose
to say they aren't tumors.

516
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,300
They're just pus, which
would explain why they
weren't there yesterday.

517
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,040
It can't be an infection.
He got IVIG,

518
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,810
broad-spectrum antibiotics...
Exactly.

519
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,510
Creates a perfect world
for fungus, moves in,
gets married,

520
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,610
has little fungi...

521
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,280
If you're wrong about
the fungus, you're wasting
what little time he has left.

522
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,880
Not a big sacrifice.
His life sucks.

523
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,120
So let's be right.
Go stick a needle
in the kid's head.

524
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,250
If you suck out a liquid,

525
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,820
then I'm right
and we haven't
answered anything.

526
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,000
If you suck out a solid,
you're right and no more
worrying about play dates.

527
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,200
Okay. Fine.
I'll father your child.

528
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,370
First, you got to write me
a Vicodin prescription,

529
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,080
just so I can
get through the foreplay.

530
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,410
How many days
do you have left?

531
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,180
Could probably get through
maybe the next minute or so.

532
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,750
And your coming to me means
your lackeys actually
stood up to you.

533
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,920
I'm impressed.

534
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,050
Yes, their cowardice
is inspiring.

535
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,030
Well, you should be
thanking them.

536
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,120
If they caved,
it'd give the cops evidence

537
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,260
that you intimidated
underlings to
feed your addiction.

538
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,160
I hate writing
thank-you notes.

539
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,100
Would it be weird if I asked
Cameron to write them?
You're hooking me up?

540
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,170
Unfortunately,
if I cut you off,
it'd give the cops evidence

541
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,610
that you don't really
need the pain meds.

542
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,240
I knew that cleavage
was a smokescreen.
You're a genius.

Yeah.

isn't physical.

We'll find out
if you ever give me that...
What's new?

549
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,260
What's different?
Any big changes
in your life recently?

They were abscesses
from a fungal infection.
Aspergillus.

FOREMAN: But we still have
no idea why.

has a factory defect.

HOUSE: It's genetic.
It can't be genetic.

560
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,900
He would've been
getting infections
since he was an infant.

561
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,270
Not if he grew up in a bubble.
Or if he grew up on Mars.

562

No germs there, either.
I don't mean a literal bubble.

Question is, which one?

567
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,850

he's contracted

What does it tell us?

578
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,590
It could mean
chronic granulomatous disease.

579
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,590
And the aspergillus is
a T cell issue. Common
variable immunodeficiency.

gonna take time.

The only way to cure me
is to make me sicker?

Each of the four

And how are you
gonna know which one
gains the most ground?

Well, that's the fun part.

See, if the meningococcus
is king of the hill, you get
to have another seizure.

596
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,570
Serratia will shut down
your lungs. If it's cepacia,
you'll have a heart attack.

597
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,480
And if it's the rhinovirus,
you'll sneeze.

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,970
Except when
it comes to people.

662
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,000
Everything we've learned
about this kid says
you're wrong.

663
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,310
But you can't accept that.

664
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,850
It's easy to
reject the diagnosis.

665
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,580
Not so easy to
reject your misanthropy,

666
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,880
because then
you'd have to give people
a fighting chance.

667
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,860
And that scares
the crap out of you.

668
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,080
Okay.

669
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,390
Let's get some evidence.

670
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,600
It's your lucky day.

671
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,070
HOUSE: Just found another
donor in the registry.
Perfect match.

672
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,940
We can do the transplant
with no danger to the rug rat.

673
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,640
Just have to sign here.

674
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,910
Unless there's another reason
you don't want it.

675
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,280
There's a chance I'd die.

676
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,080
A chance you'll be cured.

677
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,350
Maybe you don't
want that, either.

678
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,630
Maybe hanging out in
a hospital getting waited on
hand and foot

679
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,930
reminds you of what life used
to be like before you were
forced to play Mister Mom.

680
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,830
I don't like being sick.

681
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,370
But you don't want
to be healthy, either.

682
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,560
This is your way out.

683
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,140
Guilt free.

684
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,540
I said I'd do it
when Will's 18.

685
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,450
And he's able to take care
of himself without you.

686
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,650
Jack, your brother
and sister need you.
I know!

687
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,120
I know every second of
every day that they need me,

688
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,280
but I'm too young
to be their dad.

689
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,870
Good for you.

690
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,300
Don't pretend
you're surprised.

691
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,630
Want to go throw stuff
at people off the balcony?

692
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,300
Come on. Mail can wait.

693
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,270
I'm referring my patients
to other oncologists.

694
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,800
I'm shutting down my practice.
Oh, good.

695
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,570
'Cause I was afraid
you might overreact.

696
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,300
I can't just ask
my patients to wait

697
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,040
because Dr. Cameron's boss
won't let her come out
and play!

698
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,950
I kept you waiting
for maybe an hour...
Three hours!

699
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,220
Anybody die?
Not this time.

700
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,340
Cameron's available now.
Use her all you want.

701
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,950
So now's a better time for me
to have my life taken away?

702
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,860
It fits into
your schedule better?
Oh, poor you.

703
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,200
Think if you suffer
loudly enough...
You committed a crime!

704
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,750
What do you want me to do?
Turn myself in?

705
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,320
Yes! Yes! Do something!
Go in! Show some remorse!

706
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Tell Tritter
you'll get some help!

707
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,460
I don't need help!

708
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,410
House, get out of here.
Get out of here.

709
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,840
You are not gonna make me
feel guilty about what
Tritter is doing to us.

710
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,440
(SCOFFS)

711
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,110
You already feel guilty.

712
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,820
Your mysterious shoulder pain
isn't coming from your cane.

713
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,980
It's coming from
your conscience.

714
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,550
That used to be enough.

715
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,860
Despite all
your smartass remarks,
I knew you gave a damn.

716
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,330
This time...

717
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,030
You were either gonna
help me through this
or you weren't.

718
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,900
I got my answer.

719
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,950
Who's gonna
drive me to school,

720
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,990
help me with my homework?

721
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,320
There'll be a mom
where they take you.

722
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,590
A real mom,
someone who can cook.

723
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,500
Don't worry.
I'll still be able to
see you guys.

724
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,950
You said
you'd make him better.

725
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,560
I'm sorry.

726
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,130
Thank you
for not telling them.

727
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,370
You're a good kid.

728
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,870
Three months from now,
six months from now,

729
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,950
you'll be visiting them
and you won't be able
to say goodbye.

730
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,750
You're gonna know
you screwed up.

731
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,580
You'll take his bone marrow
and you'll take them back.

732
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,790
And they'll be a burden
and a pain,

733
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,830
and your life will never be
what it was supposed to be.

734
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,360
But you'll be proud
of yourself.

735
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,270
And your parents,
they'll be proud of you.

736
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,520
I don't think so.

737
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,050
(SIGHS)

738
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,380
It's what I wanna believe.
