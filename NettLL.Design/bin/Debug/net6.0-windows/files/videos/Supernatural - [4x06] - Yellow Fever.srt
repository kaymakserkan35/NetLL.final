1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,480
Here is a big new
comer.Her name is Lilith.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,480
I don't think I like you any more.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,430
I have got demon blood in me,Dean

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,550
I am whole new level of freak.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,510
Wait! It's not Ruby,its Lilith

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,120
Sic him,boys.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,600
You should show me some respect.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,530
I dragged you out of hell.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,660
I can throw you back in.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,500
­www.yyets.net

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Run!

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,630
It'll kill you!

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,230
Agent tyler,agent
perry,meet frank o'brien.

14
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,000
He died of a heart attack,right?

15
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,460
Three days ago.

16
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,460
But o'brien was 44 years
old and,according to this

17
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,820
­ a marathon runner.

18
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,500
Everybody drops dead sooner or later.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,860
It's why I got job security.

20
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah,but frank kicked it here.

21
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,860
Now,just yesterday,two perfectly
healthy men bit it in maumee.

22
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,100
All heart attacks. you
don't think that's strange?

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,730
Sounds like maumee's problem to me.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,630
FBI Why's the FBI give a damn,anyway?

25
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,430
We just want to see the
results of frank's autopsy.

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,460
What autopsy?

27
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,900
The one you're gonna do.

28
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,000
First dead body?

29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,560
Far from it.

30
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh,good.

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,800
­ Because these suckers
can get pretty ripe.

32
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,100
Hey,hand me those
rib cutters,would you?

33
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,860
Is that from a wedding ring?

34
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,350
-I didn't think frank was married.
- ain't my department.

35
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,260
Any idea how he got these?

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,200
You know what?

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,300
When you drop dead,you
actually tend to drop.

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,460
Body probably got scraped
up when it hit the ground.

39
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,230
What?

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,930
I-I can't find any blockages
in any of the major arteries.

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,260
Heart looks pretty damn healthy.

42
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,130
Hold that a second,would you?

43
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,460
Oh,sorry. spleen juice.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,600
­ Hell's bells,linus,have
you seen my -- who are they?

45
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,560
-Federal agents. I,uh
- and you kept them waiting?

46
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,100
You -- you said
not to disturb.

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,530
Come on back,fellas.

48
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,530
Shoes off.

49
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,260
Al britton.

50
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,930
-Good to meet you.
- you too.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,060
Thank you.

52
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,430
Okay.

53
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,330
So...

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,730
What can I do for uncle Sam?

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,960
Well,we're looking into
the death of frank o'brien.

56
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,560
We understand some of
your men found his body.

57
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,430
They did.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,300
Me and frank --
we were friends.

59
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,500
Hell,we were gamecocks.

60
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,230
That's our softball team's name.

61
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,400
They're majestic animals.

62
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,230
I knew frank since high school.

63
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,200
To be honest,I just this morning
got up the strength to go see him.

64
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,430
Frank was...

65
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,230
He was a good man.

66
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
Yeah.

67
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Big heart.

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,830
Before he died,did you
notice frank acting strange?

69
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,600
Maybe scared of something?

70
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,500
Oh,hell,yeah.

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,930
­ Real jumpy.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,830
You know what scared him?

73
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,130
No.

74
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,760
Wouldn't answer his phone.

75
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,700
Finally,I sent some of my boys
over to check on him,and,well,

76
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,300
You know the rest.

77
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,060
So,why the feds give a crap?

78
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,100
You don't really think
there's a case here?

79
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,700
-No,
-no.

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,160
It's probably nothing.

81
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,260
Just a heart attack.

82
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,730
No way that was a heart attack.

83
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,060
Definitely no way.

84
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,290
Three victims,all with
those same red scratches,

85
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,100
48 All went from jittery to
terrified to dead within 48 hours.

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,530
Something scared them to death?

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,630
All right,so,what can do that?

88
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,160
What can't?

89
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,900
­ Ghosts,vampires,chupacabra?

90
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
-It could be a hundred things.
- yeah.

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,000
So we make a list and
start crossing things off.

92
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,900
­ All right,who's the last
person to see frank o'brien alive?

93
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,430
­ Uh,his neighbor,mark hutchins.

94
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,100
-    - -Hang
on,hey. -what?

95
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,130
I don't like the looks of
those teenagers down there.

96
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,960
Let's walk this way.

97
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,130
Tyler and perry.

98
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,830
Just like aerosmith.

99
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,360
Yeah,small world.

100
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,600
So,the last time you
saw frank o'brien?

101
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,460
Monday. he was watching
me from his window.

102
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,830
­ I waved at him,but he
just closed the curtains.

103
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,060
Hmm. did you speak to him recently?

104
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,530
Did he seem different?

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,460
Uh,scared?

106
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,530
Oh,totally. he was freaking out.

107
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,630
Do you know,uh -- do
you know what scared him?

108
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,360
Well,yeah,witches.

109
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,560
Witches?

110
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,500
Like...?

111
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
Well,"wizard of oz" was on
tv the other night,right?

112
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,000
And he said that green bitch
was totally out to get him.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,300
Anything else scare him?

114
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,040
Everything else scared him --
al-qaeda,ferrets,artificial sweetener,

115
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,730
Those pez dispensers with their
dead little eyes -- lots of stuff.

116
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,900
So,tell me -- what
was frank like?

117
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,030
I mean,he's dead,you know?

118
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,660
I-I don't want to hammer
him,but he got better.

119
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,530
He got better?

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,060
Well,in high school he
was -- he was a dick.

121
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,100
A dick?

122
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,660
Like a bully.

123
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,690
I mean,he probably taped half
the town's butt cheeks together,

124
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,730
Mine included.

125
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,930
So he pissed a lot of people off.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,430
You think anyone would
have wanted to get revenge?

127
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,100
Well,I don't...

128
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,930
Frank had a heart attack,right?

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,100
Just answer the question,sir.

130
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,160
I don't think so.

131
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,960
Like I said,he got better
after what happened to his wife.

132
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,800
His wife?

133
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,260
So he was married.

134
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,760
20 She died about 20 years ago.

135
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,000
Frank was really broken up about it.

136
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,060
Don't be scared of donny.

137
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,530
He's a sweetheart.

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,160
It's marie you got to look out for.

139
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,630
She smells fear.

140
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,230
Any luck at the
county clerk's office?

141
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,630
I'm not sure I'd call it luck.

142
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,760
Frank's wife,jessie,was
a manic-depressive.

143
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,500
She went off her meds
back in '88 and vanished.

144
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,850
They found her two weeks
later,three towns over,

145
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,660
Strung up in her
motel room -- suicide.

146
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,930
Any chance frank helped
her along to the other side?

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,300
No,frank was working the swing
shift when she disappeared.

148
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,500
Airtight alibi.

149
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,800
How was frank's pad?

150
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,760
Clean.

151
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,360
Searched it top to bottom.

152
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,560
No emf,no hex bags,no silver.

153
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,730
So probably no ghosts,no
witches,no demons.

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,360
3 down and 97 to go. yeah.

155
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,460
Dude,you're going 20.

156
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,960
And?

157
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,760
That's the speed limit.

158
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,500
What? safety's a crime now?

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,860
Dude,where are you
going? that was our hotel.

160
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,360
­ Sam,I'm not gonna make a
left-hand turn into oncoming traffic.

161
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm not suicidal.

162
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,530
Did I just say that?

163
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,500
That was kind of weird.

164
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,830
Do you hear something?

165
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,930
Am I haunted?

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,760
Am I haunted?!

167
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,100
Dude.

168
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,100
Look at this.

169
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,830
I just talked to bobby. and?

170
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,630
Um,well,you're not gonna like it.

171
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,960
What?

172
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,500
It's ghost sickness.

173
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,630
Ghost sickness? yeah.

174
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,430
God,no. yeah.

175
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,960
I don't even know what that is. okay.

176
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,520
Some cultures believe
that certain spirits

177
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,220
Can infect the living
with a disease,which is

178
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,820
Why they stopped
displaying bodies in houses

179
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,500
And started taking them
off to funeral homes.

180
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,660
Okay,get to the good stuff.

181
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,030
Symptoms are you get anxious...

182
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,300
Yeah. ...and scared,then really
scared,then your heart gives out.

183
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,660
Sound familiar?

184
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,160
Yeah,but,Sam,we haven't
seen a ghost in weeks.

185
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,000
Well,I doubt you
caught it from a ghost.

186
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,990
Look,once a spirit
infects that first person,

187
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,240
Ghost sickness can spread like any
sickness through a cough,a handshake,

188
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,700
Whatever.

189
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,960
It's like the flu.

190
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,820
Now,frank o'brien
was the first to die,

191
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,130
Which means he was
probably the first infected.

192
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,130
Patient zero.

193
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,400
Our very own outbreak monkey.

194
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,060
Right. get this -- frank was
in maumee over the weekend.

195
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,400
Softball tournament...

196
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,460
Which is where he must have
infected the other two victims.

197
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,960
Were they gamecocks?

198
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,000
Cornjerkers.

199
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,390
So,ghosts infected frank,he
passed it on to the other guys,

200
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,300
And I got it from his corpse? right.

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,830
So now,what,I have 48 hours before
I go insane and my heart stops?

202
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,760
More like 24.

203
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,300
- Super.
- yeah.

204
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,530
Well,why me? why not you?

205
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,260
I mean,you got hit
with the spleen juice.

206
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,200
Yeah,um,you see,bobby and I
have a theory about that,too.

207
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,030
­­  Turns out all three victims
shared a certain,uh,personality type.

208
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,460
Frank was a bully.

209
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,400
The other two victims --
one was a vice principal,

210
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
The other was a bouncer.

211
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,100
Okay.

212
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,630
Basically,they were all dicks.

213
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,330
So you're saying I'm a dick?

214
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,330
No,no,no.

215
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
It's not just that.

216
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,280
All three victims
used fear as a weapon,

217
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,400
And now this disease is
just returning the favor.

218
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,360
I don't scare people.

219
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,560
Dean,all we do is scare people.

220
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,760
Okay,well,then,you're a dick,too.

221
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,030
Apparently,I'm not. whatever.

222
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,660
How do we stop it?

223
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,630
We gank the ghost
that started all this.

224
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,430
We do that,the disease
should clear up.

225
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,830
You thinking frank's wife?

226
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,130
Who knows why she
killed herself,you know?

227
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,030
What are you doing
waiting out here,anyway?

228
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,230
Our room's on the fourth floor.

229
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,760
It's --
it's high.

230
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,730
I'll see if I can move
us down to the first.

231
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,530
Thanks. sure.

232
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
Everything all right?

233
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,300
Oh,yeah.

234
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,460
Just peachy.

235
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,830
-
- Find anything? yeah.

236
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,070
­ Jessie o'brien's body was cremated,

237
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,760
So I'm pretty sure
she is not our ghost.

238
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,660
Hey.

239
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,130
Quit picking at that.

240
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,060
-
- How you feeling? awesome.

241
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,860
It's nice to have my head
on the chopping block again.

242
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,730
I almost forgot what
that feels like. yeah.

243
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,930
It's freaking delightful.

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
We'll keep looking.

245
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,230
You okay?

246
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Dean.

247
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,660
We've been completely ignoring
the biggest clue we have -- you.

248
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,400
I don't want to be a clue.

249
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,900
The abrasions,this -- the disease,it's
trying to tell us something.

250
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,260
Tell us what
-- wood chips?

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,860
Exactly.

252
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
I'm not going in there.

253
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,900
I need backup,and
you're all I've got.

254
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
You're going in,Dean.

255
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,200
Let's do this.

256
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,230
It is a little spooky,isn't it?

257
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh,I'm not carrying that.

258
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,930
It could go off.

259
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,830
I'll man the flashlight.

260
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,800
You do that.

261
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,460
Emf's not gonna work
with me around,is it?

262
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,460
You don't say.

263
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,030
Come on.

264
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,130
What
-- shh.

265
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,030
"to frank. love,jessie."

266
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,130
Frank o'brien's ring.

267
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,100
What the hell was frank doing here?

268
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
No idea.

269
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,700
That was scary!

270
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,930
Wait.

271
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,460
Luther garland.

272
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,460
Hey,this is,uh...

273
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,960
...this is frank's wife.

274
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,700
Plot thickens.

275
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah...

276
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,430
But into what?

277
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,100
Guess we got the right place.

278
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,260
Is he...drunk?

279
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,100
No.

280
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,760
Deputy,according to this,

281
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,360
Luther garland's cause of
death was physical trauma.

282
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,930
What does that mean?

283
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,060
The guy died 20 years
ago -- before my time.

284
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,260
Sorry.

285
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,760
Then can we talk to the sheriff?

286
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,560
Um,he's out sick today.

287
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,600
Well,if you see him,will
you have him call us?

288
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,300
We're staying at the bluebird.

289
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,500
Mind if I take this?

290
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,330
Know what?

291
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,860
You're awesome.

292
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,160
Thanks.

293
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,330
Um,y-you too,I guess.

294
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,100
­ Who was that?

295
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,660
It,uh --
those fbi guys.

296
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,930
What did they want?

297
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,830
A file --
luther garland's.

298
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,600
Sheriff?

299
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,360
They know.

300
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,500
They know.

301
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,700
They know what you did,and
they're gonna make you pay.

302
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,930
This isn't gonna work.

303
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,230
Come on,these badges are fake.

304
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,860
What if we get busted?
we could go to jail.

305
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,060
Dean,shh! calm down.

306
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,760
Deep breath,okay?

307
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,400
There. you feel better?

308
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,160
Just come on.

309
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,930
Don't scratch.

310
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,100
Mr. garland.

311
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,060
Hi. um,I'm agent tyler.

312
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,660
This is agent
perry -- fbi.

313
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,830
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about your brother luther.

314
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Let me see some I.d.

315
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,600
Certainly.

316
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,560
Those are real.

317
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,100
Obviously.

318
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,860
­ I mean,who would pretend
to be an fbi agent,huh?

319
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,060
That's just nutty.

320
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,560
What do you want to know?

321
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,930
Uh,well...

322
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,030
According to this,your brother
luther died of physical trauma.

323
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,130
You don't agree.

324
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,300
No,I don't.

325
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
Well,then,what would you call it?

326
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,930
Don't matter what an old man thinks.

327
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,360
Mr. Garland...

328
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,600
We're just trying to get
the truth on your brother.

329
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,630
Please.

330
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,460
Everybody was scared of luther.

331
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,200
They called him a monster.

332
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,200
He was too big,too mean-looking.

333
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,360
Just too  different.

334
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,600
Didn't matter he was the
kindest man I ever knew.

335
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,330
Didn't matter he'd never hurt no one.

336
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,500
A lot of people failed luther.

337
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,100
I was one of them.

338
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,440
I was a widower with three young'uns,

339
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,000
And  I told myself there
was nothing I could do.

340
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,900
Mr. garland,um...

341
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,360
Do you recognize this woman?

342
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,260
It's jessie o'brien.

343
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,030
Her man,frank,killed luther.

344
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,600
How do you know that?

345
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,430
Everybody knows.

346
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,460
They just don't talk about it.

347
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,400
Jessie was a
receptionist at the mill.

348
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,930
She was always real nice to
luther,and he had a crush on her.

349
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,430
But frank didn't like it.

350
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,150
And when jessie went missing,

351
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,400
Frank was sure that luther
had done something to her.

352
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,730
Turns out the old gal killed
herself,but frank didn't know that.

353
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,000
They found luther with a
chain wrapped around his neck.

354
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,810
He was dragged up
and down the stretch

355
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,860
Outside that plant
till he was past dead.

356
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,330
And o'brien was never arrested?

357
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,030
I screamed to every cop in town.

358
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,830
They didn't want to look into frank.

359
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,260
He was a pillar of the community.

360
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,430
My brother was just the town freak.

361
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,160
You must have hated frank o'brien.

362
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,300
I did for a long time,but
life's too short for hate,son.

363
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,730
And frank wasn't thinking straight.

364
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,230
His wife had vanished.
he was terrified.

365
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:26,260
A damn shame he had to put luther
through the same,but...that's fear.

366
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,130
It spreads and spreads.

367
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,150
Now we know what
these are -- road rash,

368
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,520
And I'm guessing luther
swallowed some wood

369
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,160
Chips when he was being
dragged down that road.

370
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,860
Makes sense.

371
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,100
­ You're experiencing
his death in slow motion.

372
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,960
Yeah,well,not slow enough,huh?

373
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,230
Say we burn some bones
and get me healthy.

374
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,460
Dean,it won't be that easy.

375
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,060
No,no. it'll be that easy.

376
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,630
Why wouldn't it be that easy?

377
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,460
Luther was road-hauled.

378
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,530
His body was ripped to pieces.

379
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,460
He was probably scattered
all over that road.

380
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,530
There's no way we're
gonna find all the remains.

381
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,900
You're kidding me.

382
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,060
Look,we'll just have to
figure something else out.

383
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,300
You know what? screw this.

384
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,400
Whoa,whoa,whoa. Dean.

385
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,000
Come on. no,I mean,come on,Sam.

386
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,400
What are we doing?!

387
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,200
We're hunting a ghost.

388
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,200
­ A ghost -- exactly.
who does that?

389
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,730
Us.

390
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,400
Us? right.

391
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:26,460
And that,Sam -- that is
exactly why our lives suck.

392
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,530
And that,Sam -- that is
exactly why our lives suck.

393
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I mean,come on. we hunt monsters!

394
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,430
I mean,come on. we hunt monsters!

395
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:31,500
What the hell?!

396
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,730
What the hell?!

397
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:32,800
I mean,normal people,they
see a monster,and they run.

398
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,830
I mean,normal people,they
see a monster,and they run.

399
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,180
But not us -- no,no,no.
we -- we search out things

400
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,460
that want to kill us.

401
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,830
Yeah? huh? or eat us!

402
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,860
­  ­ You know who does
that? crazy people!

403
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,560
We...are insane!

404
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,010
You know,

405
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,640
And then there's the bad diner
food and then the skeevy motel rooms

406
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,900
and then the truck-stop
waitress with the bizarre rash.

407
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,900
­ I mean,who wants this life,Sam?

408
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,230
Huh? seriously?

409
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,090
Do you actually like being stuck

410
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,880
in a car with me eight hours a day,

411
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,900
Every single day?

412
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,060
I don't think so!

413
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,220
I mean,I drive too fast,

414
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,810
And I listen to the same five albums

415
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,430
over and over and over
again, a-and I sing along.

416
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,830
I'm annoying.I know that.

417
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,160
and you --
you're gassy!

418
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,130
you eat half a
burrito,and you get toxic!

419
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,400
I mean,you know what?

420
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,500
you can forget it.

421
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,360
whoa,Dean.where are you going?

422
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,260
stay away from m Sam,okay?

423
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,760
­ cause I am done with it.

424
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,360
I'm done with the monsters and
-- and -- and the hellhounds

425
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,730
and the ghost sickness
and the damn apocalypse.

426
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,900
I'm out. I'm done.quit.

427
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,860
I looked everywhere for you,Dean.

428
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,560
how the hell did you get here?

429
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,630
ran.

430
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,430
what do we do now?

431
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,700
I got less than four
hours on the clock.

432
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,300
I'm gonna die,Sammy.

433
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,830
yeah,you are.

434
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,000
you're going back.

435
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,160
back?

436
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,930
downstairs,Dean  hell.

437
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,230
it's about damn time,too.

438
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,800
truth is,

439
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,160
you've been a real pain in my ass.

440
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,460
no!

441
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,260
you get out of my brother,you
evil son of a bitch!

442
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,500
­ no one's possessing me,Dean.

443
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,460
this is what I'm going to become.

444
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,530
this is what I want to become.

445
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,500
­ there's nothing
you can do about it.

446
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,400
hey,hey,hey,Dean.

447
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,660
hey,Dean. Dean. Dean.

448
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,880
howdy,Sam.

449
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,380
hey,bobby.

450
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,550
hey,thanks for coming so quick.

451
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,250
? where's Dean?

452
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,350
home sick.

453
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,910
Oh,this isn't helping.

454
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,050
So,have his
hallucinations started yet?

455
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,250
Yeah,a few hours ago.

456
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,610
How we doing on time?

457
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,060
We saw the coroner about 8:00
a.m. monday morning,so,uh...

458
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,810
Just under two hours.

459
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,580
What about you? you find anything?

460
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,850
­ This,uh,encyclopedia of
spirits dates to the edo period.

461
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,280
You can read japanese?

462
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,950
Guess so,show-off.

463
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,710
Anyway,this book lists a kind
of ghost that could be our guy.

464
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,750
It,uh,infects people with fear.

465
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,210
buruburu It's called a buruburu.

466
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,950
It say how to kill it?

467
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,610
Same as usual --
burn the remains.

468
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,850
Wonderful. uh...is there a plan "b"?

469
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,810
Well,the buruburu is born of fear.

470
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,480
Hell,it is fear.

471
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,180
And the lore says we
can kill it with fear.

472
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,180
So we have to scare a ghost to death?

473
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,510
Pretty much.

474
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,580
How the hell we gonna do that?

475
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,410
So,uh,just ride out the trip,okay?

476
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,150
You're -- you're gonna
be fine. we got a plan.

477
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,750
What is it?

478
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,750
Uh,just a good plan,all
right? hang in there.

479
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,550
This is a terrible plan.

480
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,880
Yeah,tell me about it.

481
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,110
I know I said,"scare the
ghost to death," but this?

482
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,900
You got a better idea,I'm listening.

483
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,580
Sheriff?

484
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,180
What are you doing?

485
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,210
Why are you looking into
luther garland's death?

486
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,850
Hey,hey,you're
-- you're sick.

487
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,650
You're sick. you're sick,all right?

488
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,010
Just -- just like
me,okay? you got to relax.

489
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,580
Frank o'brien was my friend.

490
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,910
So he made a mistake.

491
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,280
So I didn't bust him.

492
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,610
So what?

493
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,780
And you're gonna bring
me down over that?!

494
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,450
No,sir.

495
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,510
They know what you did.

496
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,780
Get away from me!

497
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,850
- Al,you got to calm down!
- step back!

498
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,710
They know...

499
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,910
Any luck?

500
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,880
I don't know what's wrong,bobby.

501
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,380
Last time he came right at us.

502
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,650
It's almost like he's,uh...

503
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,250
Like he's scared.

504
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,680
So now what?

505
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,180
I guess I got to make him angry.

506
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,280
Hey,luther!

507
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,910
Come on,luther! where
the hell are you?

508
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,750
What are you waiting for?

509
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,450
You're going back.

510
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,610
Hi,Dean.

511
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,260
No. no.

512
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,300
Yes.

513
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,700
It's me
-- lilith.

514
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,100
Oh,I missed you so much.

515
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
It's time to go back now.

516
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,360
You -- you
are not real!

517
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,800
What's the matter,Dean?

518
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,330
Don't you remember all
the fun you had down there?

519
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,060
You do remember.

520
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,100
4 months is like
40 years in hell.

521
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,400
Like doggy years.

522
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,130
And you remember every second.

523
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,330
You are not real.

524
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,700
It doesn't matter.

525
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,960
You're still gonna die.

526
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,500
You're still gonna burn.

527
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,500
Why me?

528
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,130
Why'd I get infected?

529
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,760
Silly goose.

530
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,400
You know why,Dean.

531
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,730
Listen to your heart.

532
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,200
What?

533
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,760
Bobby,punch it!

534
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,660
So you guys rode of
ghosts  with a chain?

535
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,030
Iron chain etched with a spell word.

536
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,160
Hmm. now,that's a new one.

537
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,260
It was what he was most afraid of.

538
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,660
It was pretty brutal,though.

539
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:17,730
On the upside,I'm still
alive,so,uh,go,team.

540
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,630
Yeah. how you feeling,by the way?

541
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,730
Fine.

542
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
You sure,Dean?

543
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,530
'cause this line of
work can get awful scary.

544
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,630
I'm fine.

545
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,400
You want to go hunting? I'll hunt.

546
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,530
I'll kill anything.

547
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,830
Aw. he's adorable.

548
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,400
I got to get out of here.

549
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,600
You boys drive safe.

550
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,430
You too,bobby.

551
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,730
Hey,thanks.

552
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,160
So,uh...

553
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,600
So,what did you see?

554
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,130
Near the end,I mean.

555
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,830
Oh,besides a cop beating my ass?

556
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,400
Seriously.

557
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,000
Howler monkeys.

558
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,760
Whole roomful of them.

559
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,660
- Those things creep the hell out of me.
- right.

560
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,500
No,no,just the usual stuff,Sammy.

561
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,900
all right!

562
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,060
risin' up,back on the street

563
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,130
did my time,took my chances

564
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,830
went the distance,now
I'm back on my feet

565
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,900
just a man and his will to survive

566
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,460
so many times,it happens too fast

567
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,960
you trade your passion for glory

568
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,530
don't lose your grip on
the dreams of the past

569
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,430
you must fight just
to keep them alive

570
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,100
it's the eye of the tiger

571
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,960
it's the thrill of the fight

572
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:36,530
risin' up to the
challenge of our rival

573
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,860
and the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

574
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:47,500
and he's watchin' us all
with the eye of the tiger

575
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,760
all right!
