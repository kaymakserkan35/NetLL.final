00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,800
Who are you?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,500
Castiel.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm an angel of the lord.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,700
I'm the one who gripped you tight
and raised you from perdition.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,600
????

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
<i>You are not real!</i>

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,100
What's the matter, Dean?

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,400
Don't you remember all the fun
you had down there?

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,300
Somebody help me!

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,900
Hello again, Dean.

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,300
Don't you recognize me?

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,200
But we were so close...
in hell.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,400
Alastair.

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,900
They sliced...

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,600
Carved...

16
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,000
And tore at me
in ways that you...

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,800
And alastair
would make me an offer

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,400
To take me off the rack
if I started the torturing.

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
And every day, I told him to
stick it where the sun shines.

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
For 30 years,
I told him.

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,800
Then I couldn't do it
anymore, sammy.

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,700
And I got off th rack.

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,300
And I started
ripping them apart.

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,200
I lost count
of how many souls.

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,700
Crap.

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,800
What the hell?!

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,800
You?

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,500
I-It's impossible.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,600
You stay away from me!

00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,500

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,900
What are you doing?

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
????

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,700
Like you're
looking for a job.

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,800
Yahtzee.

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,600
We just finished a job
like two hours ago.

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,700
Adrenaline's still pumping,
I guess.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
So, what do you think...

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Cedar rapids,
tulsa, or chi-Town?

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
I am all for working.
I really am.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,900
But you got us chasing cases
nonstop for like a month now.

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,900
We need sleep.

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,500
We can sleep
when we're dead.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,600
You're exhausted, Dean.

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
- I'm good.
- No, you're not.

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,800
You're running on fumes,
and you can't run forever.

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
And what
am I running from?

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,200
From what you told me.

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,000
Or are we pretending
that never happened?

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Stratton, nebraska --
Farm town.

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,900
A man gets hacked to death
in a locked room inside a locked house.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
No signs
of forced entry.

56
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,300
- Sounds like a ghost.
- Yes, it does.

57
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,500
Boy, three bedrooms,
two baths, and one homicide.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,500
This place is gonna sell
like hotcakes.

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,700
Hey, check this out.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,700
It's probably
a dumbwaiter.

61
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
All these old houses
had them.

62
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,500
Know-It-All.

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,100
- What?
- What?

64
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
You said...

65
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
What?

66
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,700
Never mind.

67
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, no bloodstains,
fresh coat of paint,

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
This is
a bunch of bubkes.

69
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,700
Needle's
all over the place.

70
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,900
Yeah -- Power lines.

71
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,500
Great.

72
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,000
So, uh...

73
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,100
Well, that's
super-Disturbing.

74
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,300
Think it
got left behind?

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
By who?

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500
Unless bill gibson
likes to play with doll heads.

77
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
I thought you said
this place was still for sale.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
Apparently,
it's not.

79
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,700
Come on, buster!

80
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,400
What do you think?
It's nice, right?

81
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,700
Did anyone bother to check
if we get a signal out here?

82
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,000
Actually, I did, kate.

83
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,700
But we decided to move anyway,
just to ruin your life.

84
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,100
Come on.
Let's unpack.

85
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,600
Uncle ted,
please back me up here.

86
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,000
Kid's right, bri.
You're ruining her life.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
See?

88
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,000
Thanks for the help,
uncle ted.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,900
I call it
like I see it, buddy.

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
- What?
- Be nice.

91
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
<i>I am nice.</i>

92
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
What do you think?

93
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,800
We do okay?

94
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
I don't know.

95
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,500
Who are they?

96
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Can I help you?

97
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Hi. Are you
the new owner?

98
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,500
Yeah.
You guys are...?

99
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,800
This is mr. Stanwyk.
I'm mr. Babar.

100
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,200
County code enforcement.

101
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,500
We had the building
inspected last week.

102
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Is there a problem?

103
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,200
Asbestos in the walls,
a gas leak --

104
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Yeah, I'd say
we got a problem.

105
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,700
Asbestos?
Meaning what?

106
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,800
Meaning until this house is
up to code, it's uninhabitable.

107
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,700
You're saying
we can't stay here?

108
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,800
It's a health hazard.
You don't want to.

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
Hold up.
We just drove 400 miles.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,900
There's a motel
just down the road.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,700
Till this gets cleaned up,
I suggest you stay there.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,000
All right,
and what if we don't?

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,700
Well, you get a fine,
you go to jail.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,500
Pick your poison.

115
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,000
One night.

116
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,200
One night, and I'll
take care of everything,

117
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
- A.S.A.P. -- I promise.
- Yeah, you do that.

118
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,900
<i>Another motel?
Awesome, dad.</i>

119
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,400
I hope this one has hooker sheets,
like the last one.

120
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,600
Come on, danny!

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,700
What did the room look like
when you found it, mrs. Curry?

122
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,000
I already told t local boys --
There was blood...everywhere.

123
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
And mr. Gibson --
Where was he?

124
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,400
Everywhere.

125
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,100
How long have you been cleaning
mr. Gibson's house?

126
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,200
About five years.

127
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
So you knew him prettyell.

128
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,200
Not really well.

129
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,800
He was real private.
Not the easiest man.

130
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,000
Not that I blame him.

131
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
What do you mean?

132
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,000
His wife dies
in childbirth.

133
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Daughter hangs herself
in the attic 20 years later.

134
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,700
I'd be bitter, too.

135
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
I think
I got some pictures.

136
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,300
Here.

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Thanks.

138
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,500
- Can we keep these?
- Suit yourself.

139
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Now, why'd the daughter
kill herself?

140
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know.
That was before my time.

141
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,600
Did you ever notice
anything odd in the house

142
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,700
When you were cleaning it?

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,800
Like what?

144
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,900
Like, you know,
like lights going on and off,

145
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,300
Things not being
where you left them.

146
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,500
No.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,300
<i>Well, maybe
there was one thing.</i>

148
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,200
What's that?

149
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Well, sometimes,
I thought I heard like a...

150
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,100
Rustling in the walls.

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
- Like a rat?
- Yeah.

152
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,100
Must have been some big
sons of guns out there, huh?

153
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,900
Wouldn't know.
Never saw any.

154
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,700
Do you happen to know where
mrs. Gibson and her ughter were buried?

155
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,500
They were
both cremated.

156
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
All right.

157
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,000
So it probably wasn't
the mom or the daughter.

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
- Whose ghost was it?
- I don't know.

159
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,900
But I say we give that place
a real once-Over and see.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,400
Code enforcement, my ass.
There's no asbestos.

161
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,100
You sure?

162
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,500
Hell yes. I've built
enough homes to know that.

163
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,000
No gas leak, either.

164
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Who were those guys?

165
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,200
Not from the county --
I can tell you that.

166
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
You okay?

167
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,400
Yeah.

168
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,800
I just thought I saw something,
that's all.

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,300
It -- It's gonna be
great here, kate.

170
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
It really is.

171
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah, mom.

172
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm sure.

173
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,300
Everythi's gonna change.

174
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,500
Danny!
Are you unpacking?

175
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Yeah.
I'm almost finished.

176
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,100
Hello?

177
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,200
It's okay.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm danny.

179
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,100
Hi!

180
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,000
"Zucchini will grow,

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,500
But the soil is too
acidic for beets."

182
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,500
Do you understand
any of this?

183
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,000
Can you smell that?

184
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,400
That.

185
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,800
It smells like a raccoon
died up there or something.

186
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
That's pleasant.
Thank you.

187
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,100
Can I continue having
a conversation with myself?

188
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, I'm listening.

189
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,000
A...vegetable garden.

190
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,600
What are we doing, bri?

191
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,400
- What do you mean?
-Us...on a farm...

192
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,300
Talking about zucchini.

193
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,500
It's gonna be
different.

194
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,300
I promise you.

195
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,500
We're gonna be happy.

196
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,100
And if we're not?

197
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
<i>We will be.</i>

198
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
<i>We have to be.</i>

199
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,100
I can't put the kids through
another year like the last.

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Crap.

201
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,000
So, what now?

202
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,100
We could
tell them the truth.

203
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,400
- Really?
- No, not really.

204
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
Hey, guys! You're gonna want
to come see this!

205
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
What the...

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,900
Crayon.

207
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,400
Danny!

208
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,300
Get your butt
down here!

209
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,000
<i>Tell you what --
If my kid did this --</i>

210
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,700
He's not your kid, ted.
Just butt out.

211
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,600
Hey.
Go easy on him.

212
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,900
The teacher said
he might act out.

213
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,000
Hey, buddy.

214
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Something you want to tell
me and your mom?

215
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,300
I didn't do that.

216
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay.

217
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,100
Look,
just tell me the truth,

218
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,400
And all you got to do
is clean it up, okay?

219
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,300
No punishment.

220
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,600
But I didn't.

221
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,500
The girl in the walls
did it.

222
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,000
The girl
in the walls?

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,300
She wants you to go
and me to stay.

224
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,500
All right, one last time --
The truth, buddy.

225
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,900
<i>That is the truth.</i>

226
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,600
I can stay,but she hate ????

227
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
And if you don't leave, she's
gonna get really, really mad!

228
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
All right,
go to your room.

229
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,700
Mom!

230
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,800
If andy were here,
he'd believe me!

231
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,200
Upstairs -- Now!

232
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
It's okay, buster.
It's okay.

233
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,000
I hate it he, too.

234
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,900
Buster! Gross!
What's the matter with you?

235
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,300
Oh, my god.
Oh, god.

236
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,800
- Ew! Ew!
- It's okay.

237
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Katie, baby, baby. Calm down
and tell us what happened.

238
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,900
I just got molested
by casper the pervy ghost!

239
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,800
That's what happened!

240
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
- Ghost?
- Yes, dad -- A ghost!

241
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,700
It's the girl
in the walls!

242
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,700
Who?!

243
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,800
Both of you,
knock it off.

244
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,300
We heard screams.
What's going on?

245
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,300
Oh, you two!
Did you touch my daughter?!

246
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,800
What? No.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,100
- Who are you guys?
- Relax, please.

248
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,200
You have a ghost.

249
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,000
A ghost.

250
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
I told you!
It's the girl!

251
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,400
Both of you, relax.

252
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you guys
playing?

253
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,300
Your family's in danger.

254
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,000
You need to get out
of the house now.

255
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,500
What the hell?

256
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,900
Nobody move!

257
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
Buster!

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,100
Buster!

259
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,700
Buster?

260
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,400
Buster! Buster!

261
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,900
What the hell?

262
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,100
Buster!

263
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,500
Go back inside.

264
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,600
Go!

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
We are not the bad guys,
but you're in danger.

266
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,700
First thing's first.

267
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,200
You got to get your family
out of here.

268
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,500
Head to the motel
I was talking about.

269
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
You'll be safe there.

270
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,700
What are you two
gonna do?

271
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
Oh, come on!

272
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,200
Oh, come on!

273
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Dude, the guns are gone.
So is the...

274
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
<i>Basically,
everything is gone.</i>

275
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
Truck's no good.

276
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,300
Both tires slashed.

277
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,200
What kind of ghost
messes with a man's wheels?!

278
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,300
What's going on?
What's going on?

279
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,500
She's there!
She's there!

280
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,300
Where?!

281
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,100
She was right there
in theoods!

282
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,000
What's a ghost doing
outside?

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
You want to stay
and find out?

284
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,900
Everybody inside.

285
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,500
Are you crazy? We need to get
the hell out of here!

286
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,200
In what?!
This ghost is hunting us!

287
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,100
Everybody back inside now!
Move!

288
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,600
Whatever's outside,
it can't get in this circle.

289
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,200
As long as the salt line
is unbroken,

290
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,100
This is
the safest place to be.

291
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,500
Safe from ghosts?

292
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,700
Yes,
as a matter of fact.

293
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay. I'm not listening
to this anymore. Come on.

294
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,900
I got to get my family
out of here. Let's go.

295
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,800
Nobody's going anywhere
until we kill this thing.

296
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,300
Sir, please.
This is what we do.

297
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,700
Just...trust us.

298
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,700
You hunt ghosts?

299
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,400
That's right.

300
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,300
Like scooby-Doo?

301
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,000
Better.

302
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,000
You saw her outside,
right?

303
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,400
Okay. Does she look like
either one of the girls?

304
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Her.

305
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,100
<i>She was paler and a lot dirtier,
but that was her.</i>

306
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,700
That's the girl
in the walls.

307
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,400
So it's the daughter?

308
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,500
That girl in the picture --
She-She's dead?

309
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,200
She killed herself
side this house.

310
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,500
So, what

311
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,100
The maid got her story wrong?
Rebecca wasn't cremated?

312
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,500
Unless her spirit's just attached
to something inside the house.

313
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
She hung herself
in the attic, right?

314
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,400
You want to babysit?
I'll check it out.

315
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,800
Look -- I don't care
who hung themselves where.

316
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,200
<i>Maybe something
is going on here, but --</i>

317
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,900
It's a spirit, man.

318
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,800
No, it's just
some backwoods hillbilly bitch,

319
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,500
And I'm not about to
sit around here

320
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,700
Waiting for her to go
all "deliverance" on my ass.

321
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,800
Well, nobody's
leaving the house.

322
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Stop me.

323
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,600
Listen, man.
I've got a gun.

324
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
You don't get your ass
back in that circle,

325
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,300
You're gonna have yourself
a third hole.

326
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,100
Dude,
you don't have a gun.

327
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,300
And?

328
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm not letting that bastard
or anyone else die tonight.

329
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,500
You cool?

330
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Go.

331
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Hey.
Fonzie.

332
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,400
Question for you.

333
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,700
This indestructible force field
made out of salt...

334
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,500
Have to be kosher stuff,
or what?

335
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,300
Knock it off, ted.

336
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
What was that?

337
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,100
Mom.

338
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,100
All right,
everybody stay calm.

339
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,400
She's a ghost.
She can't come in the circle.

340
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
I thought you said ghosts
couldn't cross the circle.

341
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
They can't.
She's not a ghost.

342
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,100
- Shoot her! Shoot her!
- Yeah, about that...

343
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,700
Go, go, go! Move!

344
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Hey!

345
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,100
Hey. You okay?

346
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,300
- Where is everybody?
- Hiding.

347
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,800
All right, go get them.
Go. Go get them.

348
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,300
- So, it's not a ghost.
- So, it's just a girl?

349
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not just a girl.
It's psycho nell.

350
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm telling you, man --
Humans.

351
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,500
So, who is she, then?

352
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
I don't know. Maybe
it's the daughter, rebecca.

353
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,300
Maybe she didn't
hang herself.

354
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,800
Dude, no. She'd have to be
like 50 years old by now.

355
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,100
Well, I don't know.
What'd you find in the attic?

356
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,500
Some old junk.
I found rebecca's diary.

357
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,100
That's about it.

358
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,600
I wish
you'd found a howitzer.

359
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,300
Listen, we got to
get this family safe.

360
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,100
I mean, it's just a human,
so they can make a run for it.

361
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,300
We just
got to hold her off.

362
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
We're okay.

363
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Danny! Ted!
We got to go!

364
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,700
- I'm good!
- Danny! Come on!

365
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,300
Danny, buddy,
we got to go!

366
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,600
Told you
it was some crazy bitch.

367
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Yes, you did.

368
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,300
Head to town.
We'll take it from here, okay?

369
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,600
Danny, come on, baby!
We're leaving!

370
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,300
Danny,
we got to go!

371
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,300
Brian, where --
Where is he?

372
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,900
Danny!

373
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,100
- Danny!
- Suse, suse, suse, suse.

374
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,200
We will find danny.
I promise you.

375
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,800
No!

376
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
Take kate
and go now.

377
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,500
- Now! While you still have a chance!
- Not without danny! No way!

378
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,300
I am not going out there
with mom alone!

379
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,400
She's right.
She's right.

380
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,700
Until we find your son,

381
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,300
The safest place for you
right now is in the shed.

382
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,700
I am not going in there,
either.

383
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Yes, you are.
It is the best defense.

384
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
The windows are boarded up.
It's got one door.

385
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,600
It's our best shot
right now.

386
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,700
Trust me.

387
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,700
Suse, kate...
go. Go.

388
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,100
All right.

389
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,600
You and me
will take the outside.

390
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,300
You two
take the house.

391
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Let's go.

392
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,900
What are you doing?

393
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,900
<i>She's human. She had to
come from somewhere.</i>

394
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,200
- You smell that?
- Every day.

395
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Come on.

396
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,500
<i>You're not
going down there.</i>

397
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,400
<i>Well, do you want to?</i>

398
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,000
Please nobody grab my leg.
Please nobody grab my leg.

399
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,300
Yeah.

400
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,100
Dog

401
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,300
It's what's for dinner.

402
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,800
Danny?

403
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,300
Find anything?

404
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,200
Yeah --
Her kitchen.

405
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,800
<i>Her what?</i>

406
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,500
Look...why are we
just standing here?

407
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Let's go in.
Let's check the house.

408
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,100
We have to wait for those guys
to get back, okay?

409
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,400
- Sam, it's me.
- Help me out.

410
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,900
Did you get danny?

411
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,500
No.

412
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,400
No?

413
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,300
W-Well, where's ted?

414
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,700
He's outside.

415
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
<i>Well, why doesn't
he come inside?</i>

416
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,500
Because I had to
carry him out.

417
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,300
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,100
What does --
What does that mean?

419
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,600
What does that mean
that you're sorry?

420
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,500
Are you saying
that he's dead?

421
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
No. He's not saying
that he's dead.

422
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,700
You're not saying that,
are you?

423
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,900
We were in the walls,
and she attacked.

424
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,600
And I couldn't
get to him in time.

425
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,800
Uncle ted is dead?

426
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
I shouldn't have
left him alone.

427
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm very sorry.

428
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,500
We'll find him, suse.
We will.

429
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,600
Where else is there
to look?

430
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
- Danny's dead, isn't he?
- No, suse.

431
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
He is. Why not?

432
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,800
She killed my brother,
noshe killed my son.

433
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,800
- No, danny is alive.
- No. No, he isn't.

434
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,100
Yes, he is.

435
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,500
Do you remember
what he said

436
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
About the girl
who lived in the walls?

437
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
She said he could stay.

438
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,000
No.

439
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,400
I just don't understand
why this happens to us.

440
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,600
I mean, we're good people.
We're a good family.

441
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,100
What happened to andy
happened, okay?

442
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,600
I cannot change that.

443
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,500
<i>But I will find danny.
I promise you.</i>

444
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,800
And when I do,
we are gonna be fine.

445
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,900
You and me, the kids --
We're gonna be fine.

446
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,200
Andy your son?

447
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,300
Oldest.

448
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,800
He got himself killed
in a car accident last year.

449
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,200
I'm sorry.

450
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,200
Nearly tore
suse and I apart.

451
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,500
Still could,
I imagine.

452
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,000
That's why
we moved here.

453
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,500
Fresh air,
fresh start.

454
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,000
Not even my line.

455
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:40,960
Marriage counselor.

456
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,760
Or she might be right.

457
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:49,721
After all, what could possibly
go wrong in the country?

458
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,695
I'm getting
your son back.

459
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:59,986
If it's the last
godforsaken thing I do.

460
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:05,243
Why do you care
so much?

461
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:09,684
Dean.

462
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:13,197
We got to talk.

463
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:15,934
[ Sighs ]
what is that?

464
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:17,599
Rebecca's diary.
I just finished reading it.

465
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:19,460
And?

466
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:21,180
That girl back there --

467
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:23,447
I'm pretty sure
she was rebecca's daughter.

468
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:24,703
Rebecca had a kid?

469
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,937
It's all
she talks about --

470
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:28,636
Being pregnant,
being ashamed of being pregnant.

471
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,770
Geez. Rent "juno."
Get over it.

472
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:32,634
Wait -- Why kill herself
after the baby?

473
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:34,797
Maybe because her dad
called her a dirty little whore

474
00:31:34,844 --> 00:31:35,890
And said
he was gonna lock the baby up

475
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,262
Where nobody
could ever see it.

476
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,565
Why would he say that?

477
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:44,039
Oh, gross.

478
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:44,775
Yeah.

479
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,494
So the daddy
was the baby-Daddy, too?

480
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,435
Dude was a monster,
Dean.

481
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:50,468
Wow.

482
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,272
A storripped
from austrian headlines.

483
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:54,857
Humans, man.

484
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:57,637
So she's been locked up
in this house her whole life?

485
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:58,892
You saw her eyes.

486
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,194
Has she ever seen light?
She's barely human.

487
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:02,474
Okay, so, what, then?

488
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,404
She's kept caged up
like an animal,

489
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:08,080
And then she busts out and ganks
dear, old dad/granddad?

490
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,010
I guess.

491
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:10,707
Well, can't say
I blame her.

492
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:11,847
I'm sure
her life was hell, Dean.

493
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:14,010
That doesn't mean she gets
a free pass for a murder spree.

494
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:15,571
Like you know
what hell's like.

495
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:17,478
I didn't...

496
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,202
Forget it.

497
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:22,247
So,
where do we find her?

498
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,377
Kid's got to eat, right?

499
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,469
What?

500
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,609
He kept her hidden,
locked up...

501
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,593
But he had to feed her,
didn't he?

502
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,753
I guess.

503
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:38,872
I think I know where.

504
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,119
He could have kept her
hidden down here for years.

505
00:33:58,181 --> 00:34:01,085
Kept her fed.
Nobody would ever know.

506
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:06,160
Danny!

507
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:08,321
Danny!
Dean: watch out.
I'm going down.

508
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:10,062
No, that's my son.
I know it is.

509
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:11,864
But I said
that I would get him.

510
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:14,359
I will. Let me.

511
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,793
You got curtains?

512
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:41,000
We need rope.

513
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,545
It's okay. Shh.

514
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:06,395
It's okay, baby.

515
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:07,738
Aaaah!
Aaaah!

516
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,932
Bitch is a klepto.

517
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:39,910
Danny!

518
00:35:45,282 --> 00:35:46,545
Danny!

519
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:51,934
Danny!

520
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:03,912
Your dad's upstairs.
Come on.

521
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:08,181
Okay.

522
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:09,842
Hurry!
He's coming back!

523
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,441
"He"?

524
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:13,302
Her brother!

525
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:15,382
Unggggh!

526
00:36:16,192 --> 00:36:17,324
Aah!
Aah!

527
00:36:35,263 --> 00:36:36,635
Danny!

528
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:37,943
Aah!

529
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,148
Come on, buddy.

530
00:36:51,195 --> 00:36:52,009
Come on, buddy.

531
00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:54,374
Don't look back, danny.
Just don't look down.

532
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:02,745
[ Gasps ] mom!

533
00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:07,343
Aah! Mom!

534
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:10,475
Come on.
I got you.

535
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,423
You okay?

536
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:14,061
It's okay.

537
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:16,385
Get him t of here.
You got to go.

538
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:20,676
Dean?

539
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:04,247
Mom!

540
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:17,886
Brian: suse!

541
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,261
Thanks for
the head start.

542
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,639
Why doesn't it surprise me
you guys don't like the police?

543
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,284
Sort of a, uh...
mutual-Appreciation
thing, really.

544
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,672
Well...thank you.

545
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:33,274
Thank you.

546
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:34,799
You okay?

547
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:39,836
No. We're the opposite
of okay.

548
00:39:39,882 --> 00:39:41,363
But...

549
00:39:41,836 --> 00:39:43,030
We're together.

550
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:14,256
You okay?

551
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:16,973
Yoknow, I felt for those
sons of bitches back there.

552
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:21,125
Lifelong torture turns you
into something like that.

553
00:40:23,025 --> 00:40:24,679
You were in hell, Dean.

554
00:40:27,513 --> 00:40:29,984
Look, maybe you did
what you did there...

555
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:32,479
But you're not them.

556
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:34,697
They were barely human.

557
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:36,631
Well, you're right.

558
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:38,164
I wasn't like them.

559
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:40,476
I was worse.

560
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:43,538
They were animals, Sam,
defending territory.

561
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:44,728
Me...

562
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,775
I did it
for the sheer pleasure of it.

563
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:50,469
What?

564
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:52,303
I enjoyed it, Sam.

565
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:58,254
They took meff the rack,
and I tortured souls,

566
00:40:58,283 --> 00:40:59,365
And I liked it.

567
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,894
All those years...

568
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,067
All that pain...

569
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:09,206
Finally getting
to deal some out yourself.

570
00:41:10,796 --> 00:41:12,990
I didn't care
who they put in front of me.

571
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:16,776
Because that f--
That pain I felt...

572
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,546
It just slipped away.

573
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:24,583
No matter
how many people I save...

574
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:28,058
I can't change that.

575
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:32,912
I can't fill this hole.

576
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:37,768
Not ever.

577
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:52,752
