1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,200
Storm's coming, and you boys...

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,600
You are smack in the middle of it.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,300
You know the truth about
Sammy and the other children.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,800
Andrew Gallagher. Ava Wilson.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,300
I didn't hurt anybody. Not yet.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,500
Max, your abilities started
seven months ago, right?

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,300
How'd you know that?

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,800
The same thing killed our mothers.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,900
You and I were chosen.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,000
For what? I don't know.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,100
I saw this guy die
days before it happened.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,900
You can make people
do things, can't you?

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,900
You can tell them what to think.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,800
Cherry ride. Can I have it? Sure, man.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,700
You must be one of us.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,200
Who? The psychics.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,000
Screw you, buddy, 'cause
i'm a secretary from peoria,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,800
And i'm not part of anything.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
This demon tells me they have soldiers

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
To fight in this coming war

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,600
Psychics fighting on hell's side.

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,500
The yellow-Eyed man tells me
to do things -- Awful things.

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,300
He told me he's got big plans.

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,100
Maybe this is his plan. Maybe
we're all supposed to be --

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,500
What, killers? Give me a break.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,900
No one's heard anything about Ava.

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,800
She's just -- Into
thin air, you know?

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,800
Sulfur. Ava.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Demon's been here.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,900
If something bad's
coming, it's coming fast,

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,400
And their side holds all the cards.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,400
We can't run from this,
and you can't protect me.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,200
Damn it, Sam, this whole thing
is spinning out of control.

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,100
Hey, don't forget the
extra onions this time, huh?

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Dude, i'm the one who's
gonna have to ride in the car

36
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,000
With your extra onions.

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,300
Hey, see if they got any pie.

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,400
Bring me some pie!

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Bring me some pie.

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,600
Sam?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Sulfur

42
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Sam!

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Sammy!

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Sam!

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,500
Sammy!

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
Sam!

47
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
Andy? Sam.

48
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,500
What are you doing here? I don't know.

49
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,000
What am I doing here? I don't know.

50
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
Where are we?

51
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,900
Andy, look, calm down.

52
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,500
I can't calm down.

53
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,800
I just woke up in
freaking frontier land.

54
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
What's the last thing you remember?

55
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,600
Honestly, my fourth bong load.

56
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,100
It was weird.

57
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,900
All of a sudden,

58
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,600
There was this really
intense smell, like a...

59
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,300
Like sulfur?

60
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,900
How did you know that?

61
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,200
Dean.

62
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,500
Your brother -- Is
he -- Is he here?

63
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,600
I don't know where he is.

64
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,400
I don't know if he's...

65
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,100
Hello?

66
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,300
Woman: no! Help me!

67
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,500
Okay, okay, i'm here.

68
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
We're gonna get you out, all right?

69
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Just hold on a second.

70
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
All right, one second.

71
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,100
Ava? Oh, my god! Sam!

72
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey.

73
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
So, I guess you guys know each other.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,900
Yeah.

75
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,000
How did you -- I
mean, how did --

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
Ava, have you been here this whole time?

77
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
What whole time? I just woke
up in there a half an hour ago.

78
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, you've been gone for five months.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
My brother and I have been
looking for you everywhere.

80
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,800
That's impossible 'cause
I saw you two days ago.

81
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
You didn't. I'm sorry.

82
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,500
But that makes no sense. It's...not...

83
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,300
Oh, my god! My fianc? Brady.

84
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,200
If I've been missing for that
long, he must be freaking out!

85
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,000
Well...

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,900
Oh!

87
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,600
Hey.

88
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Andy -- Also
freaking out.

89
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Okay.

90
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,700
What's happening?

91
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,100
Well, I, uh...

92
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I don't really know yet,
but I know one thing.

93
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,600
I know what the three
of us have in common.

94
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,900
Man: hello? Anybody there?

95
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,700
Maybe more than three.

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Wait.

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Hello?

98
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,000
Hey!

99
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,400
Hey, you guys all right?

100
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,200
Think so.

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,300
I'm Sam.

102
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,400
I'm Jake. Lily.

103
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,700
Are there any more of you?

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,900
No.

105
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,900
How did we even get here?

106
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,500
A minute ago, I was in san diego.

107
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

108
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,900
I went to sleep last
night in Afghanistan.

109
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,500
Let me take a wild guess.
You two are both 23?

110
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,700
We all are, and we all have abilities.

111
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,800
What?

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,500
It started a little over a year ago.

113
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,300
You find you can do things
you didn't think were possible.

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,500
I have visions. I see
things before they happen.

115
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,600
Yeah, me too.

116
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,900
And I can put thoughts into people's
heads -- Like, make them do stuff.

117
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,300
Oh, but don't worry. I don't
think it works on you guys.

118
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,900
Oh, but get this -- Um,
I've been practicing,

119
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,300
Training my brain,
like meditation, right?

120
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,600
So now it's not just
thoughts that I can beam out,

121
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,900
But images, too --
Like, anything I want.

122
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,700
It's like bam! People, they see it.

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,300
This one guy I know -- Total
dick -- I used it on him.

124
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,300
Gay porn all hours of the day.

125
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
It's just like...

126
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,100
You should have seen
the look on his face.

127
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,700
You go, "simon says give me
your wallet," and they do?

128
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,400
You have visions? That's great.

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
I'd kill for something like that.

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,700
Lily, listen, it's okay.

131
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
No, it's not.

132
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,100
I touch people. Their hearts stop.

133
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,500
I can barely leave my house.

134
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,400
My life's not exactly improved.

135
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,100
So screw you. I just want to go home.

136
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,200
And we don't?

137
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
Don't -- Hey,
gs, come on.

138
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,100
Look, whether we like it
or not, we're all here,

139
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,000
And so we all have to deal with this.

140
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,800
Who brought us h here?

141
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,600
It's less of a "who."
It's more of a "what."

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,100
What does that mean?

143
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,400
It's, uh...

144
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,300
It's a demon.

145
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,900
This is it -- All demonic signs
and omens over the past month.

146
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Are you joking? There's nothing here.

147
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,600
Exactly.

148
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
Come on, there's got to be something.

149
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,600
What about the normal,
low-Level stuff --

150
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,900
You know, exorcisms, that kind of thing?

151
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,100
There's nothing. It's completely quiet.

152
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,300
How are we supposed to look for
Sam, close our eyes and point?

153
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,200
Sam: Ash, what do you got?

154
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Okay, listen. It's a
bit negatory on Sam.

155
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,100
Come on, man. You got
to give us something.

156
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,000
We're looking at a
3,000-Mile haystack here.

157
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,800
Listen, Dean. I did find something.

158
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,100
Well, what?

159
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,800
I can't talk over this line, Dean.

160
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,300
Come on, I don't have time for this.

161
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Make time, ok, cause this..

162
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,800
What's up? What's going on?

163
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,300
Not only does this

164
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,000
Almost definitely help you
find your brother, this is...

165
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,900
It's huge.

166
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,700
So get here now.

167
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,900
I guess we're going to the roadhouse.

168
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,300
Come on.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,200
So, we're soldiers in a demon
war to bring on the apocalypse?

170
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,000
When you put
it like that --

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
And we've been picked? Why us?

172
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm not sure, okay?
But look, I just know --

173
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Sam. I'm sorry.

174
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,200
Psychics and spoon-Bending
is one thing, but demons?

175
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,600
It sounds crazy. It
doesn't just sound it.

176
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,800
I don't care what you think.

177
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,100
If we're gathered here together,
that means it's starting.

178
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,700
The only thing I got to do is
stay away from wackjobs, okay?

179
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,700
I've heard enough. I'm
better off on my own.

180
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,400
Fyi -- So
are you.

181
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
Jake, hold on.

182
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Jake!

183
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,200
Hello?

184
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,200
It's all right. Don't be scared.

185
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,600
Are you lost?

186
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,500
Hello?

187
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,300
Get back!

188
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,500
Just so you know...

189
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
That was a demon.

190
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
And that thing?

191
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm not sure, but I
think it was an achiri --

192
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,400
A demon that disguises
itself as a little girl.

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,200
Still doesn't tell us where we are.

194
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,700
Andy, you with me or what?

195
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Give me a minute.

196
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm still working
through "demons are real."

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,900
I've seen that bell before.

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think I know
where we are now --

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Cold oak, south dakota.

200
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
The town's so haunted,
every single resident fled.

201
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,700
Swell. Good to know we're
somewhere so historical.

202
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,800
Why in the world would that
demon or whatever put us here?

203
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
I'm wondering the same thing.

204
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,500
You know what? It doesn't matter.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,700
The only sane thing to do here
is get the hell out of dodge.

206
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,200
Wait, hold on.

207
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,300
Lily, the only way out
is through miles of woods.

208
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,400
Beats hanging out with demons.

209
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,500
Lily, we don't know what's going on yet.

210
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,900
We don't even know how
many of them are out there.

211
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,300
Yeah, he's right.
We should --

212
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,100
Don't say "we." I'm not part of "we."

213
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,900
I have nothing in
common with any of you.

214
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,200
Okay, look.
I know --

215
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,300
You don't know anything.

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I
to--

217
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,600
I accidentally touched my girlfriend.

218
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,600
Whatever.

220
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
I feel like i'm in a nightmare,

221
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
And it just keeps
getting worse and worse.

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,100
I've lost people, too.

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,300
I have a brother out there right now.

224
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,700
He could be dead, for all I know.

225
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,800
We're all in bad shape,
but i'm telling you,

226
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,400
The best way out of this
is to stick together.

227
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,000
Fine.

228
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,300
We're looking for iron, silver,
salt -- Any kind of weapon.

229
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Salt is a weapon?

230
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,800
It's a brave, new world.

231
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,300
Hopefully, there's food in your world,

232
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,500
'Cause i'm freaking starving.

233
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,000
What the hell?

234
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
My god.

235
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,200
You see Ellen?

236
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,000
No.

237
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,300
No Ash, either.

238
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
Oh, Ash, damn it!

239
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hey, you all right?

240
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,600
Yeah, i'm just...

241
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
I don't know --
A little dizzy.

242
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,600
A-Are you sure it's
not some kind --

243
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,300
What, some kind of freaky vision thing?

244
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
No, more like I'd just
kill for a sandwich.

245
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,900
I haven't eaten since...

246
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,400
Well, who knows.

247
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,500
No,
it's --

248
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,800
Don't worry, i'm fine,

249
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,700
Except for every single
thing that's happening.

250
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
You guys, I found something!

251
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,000
Salt.

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,700
That's great, Andy.
Now we all can s--

253
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,600
Where's Lily?

254
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,500
Lily?

255
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,700
Lily!

256
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,500
Oh, my god!

257
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,800
Okay, that -- That's
officially just...

258
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,900
Sam, she's dead! She's dead!

259
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,800
You said we were chosen for a reason.

260
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,500
That is not chosen. That's...killed.

261
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay, you know, we
have to get out of here.

262
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
I second that emotion.
Not sure that's an option.

263
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,500
Lily was trying to leave.

264
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,400
The demon's not gonna
let us get away that easy.

265
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,600
We got to gear up for the next attack.

266
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, gear up? Yeah.

267
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,800
Okay, well, i'm not a
soldier. I can't do that!

268
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,700
Look, if you want to stay
alive, you're gonna have to.

269
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,800
Let's go.

270
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Oh, okay.

271
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,800
I'll get her down.

272
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,300
You know...

273
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,300
I was just thinking about how
much Dean would help right now.

274
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,800
I'd give my arm for a working phone.

275
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,400
You know, you may not need one.

276
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,200
I, uh, I mean, I've never
tried it long-Distance before.

277
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,100
Do you have anything of Dean's on you,

278
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Like something he touched?

279
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,400
Uh...

280
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
I got a receipt. Will that work?

281
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,100
Yeah.

282
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,600
D. Hasselhoff?

283
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,300
Yeah, that's Dean's signature.

284
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
It...

285
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,100
It's hard to explain.

286
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,200
All right.

287
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,300
This is...

288
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,100
What the hell did Ash know?

289
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,200
We got no way of knowing where
Ellen is or if she's even alive.

290
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,200
We got no clue what
Ash was gonna tell us.

291
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,500
Now, how the hell are we gonna find Sam?

292
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,300
We'll find him.

293
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,400
Dean? No!

294
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,100
Unh!

295
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,400
Unh!

296
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,000
What was that?

297
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,900
I don't know. Headache?

298
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,000
You get headaches like that a lot?

299
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,300
No.

300
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
It must be the stress.

301
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,700
I could have swore I saw something.

302
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,000
What do you mean?
Like -- Like a vision?

303
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Like what Sam gets? What? No.

304
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm just saying.

305
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,600
Come on, i'm not some psychic.

306
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,700
Unh! Oh, god! Dean?!

307
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Dean?

308
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,300
Are you with me?

309
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,400
Yeah, I think so.

310
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,100
I saw Sam. I saw him, Bobby.

311
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
It was a vision.

312
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,600
Yeah.

313
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,700
I don't know how,
but -- But yeah.

314
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Whew!

315
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,000
That was about as fun as
getting kicked in the jewels.

316
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
What else did you see?

317
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,600
Uh, there was a bell.

318
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,600
What kind of bell?

319
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
Um, like,
a big --

320
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,600
A big bell with some
kind of engraving on it.

321
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,200
I don't know.

322
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Engraving?

323
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,100
Yeah.

324
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,200
Was it a tree --
Like, an oak tree?

325
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Yeah, exactly.

326
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,900
I know where Sam is.

327
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,700
I-I'm not superman or anything.

328
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
It's no big deal.

329
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,800
You were in afghanistan
when this started?

330
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,400
I started getting headaches,

331
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,400
Then, uh, there was this accident.

332
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,600
This guy flipped his
vehicle on a bad road,

333
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Got pinned underneath.

334
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,200
I lifted it off him like it was nothing.

335
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,400
E-Everybody said it was
a fluke adrenaline thing.

336
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,700
But then you did it again, right?

337
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,600
Bench-Press 800
pounds, stone-Cold calm.

338
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,500
I never told anybody, of course.

339
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,900
It's just too crazy.

340
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,200
Yeah, well, crazy's relative.

341
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm starting to get that.

342
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,200
Yeah.

343
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,600
By the way, I, uh,
appreciate what you're doing.

344
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,600
What am I doing?

345
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,700
Keeping calm, keeping them calm,

346
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,100
Especially considering how
freaked to hell you really are.

347
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,600
I've been in some deep
crap before myself.

348
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I know the look.

349
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Want to know the truth?

350
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,200
I got this brother, right?

351
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,300
And he's always telling me how
he's gonna watch out for me,

352
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,800
How everything's gonna be okay,
like I've been telling them.

353
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,100
Yeah.

354
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
I don't know if I believe it this time.

355
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,100
I mean, the size
of what's coming --

356
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,600
It's bigger than anyone's ever seen.

357
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,700
I mean, it's gonna get bad,
and I-I don't know if --

358
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,800
If we're gonna make it.

359
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,700
It doesn't matter if we believe it.

360
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,900
Only matters that they do.

361
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,200
My horoscope said I shouldn't
have gotten out of bed.

362
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,700
How you doing?

363
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,300
Holding up?

364
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,100
I'm okay.

365
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
What about you?

366
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,100
Not so okay.

367
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,600
Why us, Sam?

368
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,700
What did we do to deserve this?

369
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,400
Just lucky, I guess.

370
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,700
If it wasn't for bad luck,
wouldn't have no luck at all.

371
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,800
Just can't wait for this all to be over

372
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,400
So I can just pretend it never happened.

373
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,300
Just want to curl up with
Brady and watch bad tv.

374
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,200
What is it?

375
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,600
Sam, do you

376
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,200
Know something that I don't?

377
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,000
Look, Ava.

378
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,800
I'm sorry. I wish I didn't
have to tell you this

379
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,100
Tell me what?

380
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,600
When the demon broke in
to your house to take you,

381
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,400
Your fianc?Didn't make it

382
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm sorry.

383
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,600
No, it's...

384
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,600
Jake, behind you!

385
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,800
Howdy, Sam.

386
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,200
I'm dreaming.

387
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,700
What do you say you and
I take a little walk?

388
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,100
You're awfully quiet, Sam.
You're not mad at me, are you?

389
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm gonna tear you to shreds, I swear.

390
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,200
When you wake up, tiger,
you give it your best shot.

391
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,100
Where's my brother?

392
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,700
Quit worrying about Dean.
I'd worry more about yourself.

393
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,200
What, you gonna kill me?

394
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm trying to help you.
That's why we're talking.

395
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,400
You're the one i'm rooting for.

396
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,400
What's that supposed to mean?

397
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,500
Welcome to the miss america pageant.

398
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,400
Why do you think you're here?

399
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,900
This is a competition.

400
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,100
Only one of you crazy kids is

401
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,900
Gonna make it out of here alive.

402
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,800
I thought we were
supposed to be --

403
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,300
Soldiers in a coming war?

404
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,800
That's true. You are.
But here's the thing.

405
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,400
I don't need soldiers.

406
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,800
I need soldier. I just need the one.

407
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,300
Why?

408
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,600
I couldn't just come out
and say that, could I, Sam?

409
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,200
I had to let everyone think
they had a fighting chance.

410
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,400
But what I need...

411
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Is a leader.

412
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,500
To lead who?

413
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, I've already got my army
-- Or I will soon, anyway.

414
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,600
You son of a bitch.

415
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,300
Honestly, i'm surprised
you hadn't guessed.

416
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,400
I mean, why do you think so many
children flamed out already --

417
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,600
Max Miller and Andy's
brother -- What's his name?

418
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,700
They weren't strong enough.

419
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:10,300
I'm looking for the best and
brightest of your generation.

420
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,700
My generation?

421
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,300
Well, there's other generations,

422
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,900
But let's just worry about yours.

423
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,800
That's why i'm here, Sam.

424
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,000
I want to give you the inside track.

425
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,000
You're tough, you're
smart, you're well-Trained,

426
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Thanks to your daddy.

427
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,000
Sam.

428
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,300
Sammy...

429
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,800
You're my favorite.

430
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,000
You ruined my life. You
killed everyone I love.

431
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,700
The cost of doing business, i'm afraid.

432
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,900
I mean, sweet, little jessica...

433
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
She just had to die.

434
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,100
You were all set to marry
that little, blond thing,

435
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,100
Become a tax lawyer with
two kids, a beer gut,

436
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,800
And a little mcmansion in the suburbs.

437
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,100
I needed you sharp, on the road,

438
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,900
Honing your skills
-- Your gifts.

439
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,300
What about my mom?

440
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,200
That was bad luck.

441
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,300
Bad luck.

442
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,400
She walked
in on us --

443
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,200
Wrong place, wrong time.

444
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,500
What does that mean?

445
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
It wasn't about her. It was about you.

446
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,900
It's always been about you.

447
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
What?

448
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,100
Well...

449
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Okay, you caught me
in a charitable mood.

450
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,300
I'll show you.

451
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,300
Look familiar? It should.

452
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,000
Relax, Sam. This is just
a high-Def instant replay.

453
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
Enjoy the show.

454
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,400
John.

455
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,200
Mom.

456
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Is he hungry?

457
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,300
Shh.

458
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,600
Okay.

459
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Wait, mom.

460
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,300
Mom!

461
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,200
What did I just tell you,
Sam? She can't hear you.

462
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,900
This isn't real.

463
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
What the hell are you doing to me?

464
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,900
Better than mother's milk.

465
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,600
Does this mean I have...

466
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,200
Demon blood in me?

467
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,600
Answer me!

468
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,600
It's you.

469
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,800
She knew you.

470
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,600
No.

471
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,900
No!

472
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,600
I don't think you want
to see the rest of this.

473
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Sam, wake up.

474
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
Ava's missing.

475
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,600
I'll take the barn and the hotel.

476
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,400
You take the houses. All right.

477
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,900
Meet back here in 10 minutes, okay?

478
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Ava, where'd you go?

479
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,600
Didn't you hear us yelling?

480
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,500
Yeah, I heard you.

481
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,400
What are you doing?

482
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,100
Holy...

483
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,300
Ah! Aah!

484
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,800
Aah!

485
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,200
Sam, I just found him like this!

486
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,500
What happened?

487
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,600
I don't know.

488
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
How did that thing get in?

489
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Where were you?

490
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,200
I just went to get some
water from the well.

491
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
I was only gone, maybe,
like, two minutes.

492
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,100
You shouldn't have gone outside.

493
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,900
Ava, we have to stay in here.

494
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,600
Who did that?

495
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,700
I don't know.
Maybe Andy --

496
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,800
Andy wouldn't do that.

497
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,300
Ava, that line wasn't
broken when I left.

498
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,300
Ava.

499
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,300
What? You
don't think --

500
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,400
I'll tell you what I think. Five months.

501
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,200
You're the only one with all
that time you can't account for.

502
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,100
And that headache you got...

503
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,200
Right when the demon got Lily.

504
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,600
What are you trying to say?

505
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,500
What happened to you?

506
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Nothing!

507
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,100
Had you going, though, didn't I?

508
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
Yeah.

509
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,000
I've been here a long
time, and not alone, either.

510
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,500
People just keep showing
up -- Children, like us.

511
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,500
Batches of three or four at a time.

512
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,700
You killed them
-- All of them?

513
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,600
I'm the undefeated heavyweight champ.

514
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,900
Oh, my god.

515
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,300
I don't think god has
much to do with this, Sam.

516
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,400
How could you?

517
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,700
I had no choice.

518
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,500
It's me or them.

519
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,900
After a while, it was easy.

520
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,600
It was even kind of fun.

521
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,600
I just stopped fighting it.

522
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,700
Fighting what?

523
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,500
Who we are, Sam.

524
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,100
If you'd just quit your hand-Wringing

525
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,300
And open yourself up,

526
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,400
You have no idea what you can do.

527
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,600
The learning curve is so fast.

528
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,000
It's crazy, the switches
that just flip in your brain.

529
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,500
I can't believe I started
out just having dreams.

530
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,300
Do you know what I can do now?

531
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,000
Control demons.

532
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,100
Ah. You are quick on the draw.

533
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,700
Yeah, i'm sorry, Sam, but...

534
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's over.

535
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,300
It looks like the rest
of the way's on foot.

536
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,000
Let's go.

537
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,100
I think we can make it out of here now.

538
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,300
But the achiri demon.

539
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,200
No, no, no, Ava was
summoning it, controlling it.

540
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,500
It shouldn't come back
now that she's dead.

541
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,000
We got to go.

542
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,800
No. Not "we," Sam.

543
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Only one of us is getting
out of here. I'm sorry.

544
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,400
What? I had a vision.

545
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,200
That yellow-Eyed demon,
or whatever it was,

546
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,100
He talked to me.

547
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,200
He told me how it was.

548
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,800
No, Jake, listen. You
can't listen to him.

549
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,100
Sam, he's not letting us go.

550
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,000
Only one.

551
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,100
Now, we don't play
along, he'll kill us both.

552
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,600
Now, I-I like you, man. I
do, but do the math, here.

553
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,500
What good's it do for both of us to die?

554
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,500
Now, I can get out of here,

555
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,700
I get close to the demon,
I can kill the bastard.

556
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,100
Come with me. We can kill him together.

557
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,500
How do I know you won't turn on me?

558
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,100
I won't.

559
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
I don't know that.

560
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,100
Okay, look.

561
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Just come with me, Jake.

562
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Don't do this.

563
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
Don't play into what it wants.

564
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,400
Okay.

565
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,000
Ugh!

566
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
Sam!

567
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,600
Sam!

568
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,800
Dean.

569
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,100
Sam, look out!

570
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,300
No!

571
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,000
No. Sam.

572
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,600
Whoa, Sam. Sam.

573
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,400
Sam, hey.

574
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,700
Hey, come here.

575
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,300
Let me look at you.

576
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,600
Hey, look. Look at me.
It's not even that bad.

577
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,200
It's not even that bad, all right?

578
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,500
Sammy?

579
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,600
Sam!

580
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,900
Hey, listen to me. We're
gonna patch you up, okay?

581
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,600
You'll be good as new.

582
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,400
Huh?

583
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,500
I'm gonna take care of you.

584
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,700
I got you. That's my job, right?

585
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,300
Watch out for my
pain-In-The-Ass little brother.

586
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,500
Sam?

587
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,100
Sam.

588
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,000
Sam!

589
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,700
Sammy!

590
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,100
No. No, no, no.

591
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh, god.

592
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Oh, god.

593
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,100
Sam!
